The bifluoride ion, which is known to have the highest hydrogen bond energy of 160 kJ mol  &#8211;1  , is the most famous among many examples of [X(HX)  n  ]  &#8211;  anions (X = F, Cl) known in the literature. In contrast, little is known about poly(hydrogen halide) halogenates containing two different halogens, ([X(HY)  n  ]  &#8211;  ). In this work we present the synthesis of anions of the type [X(HY)  n  ]  &#8211;  (X = Br, I, ClO  4  ; Y = Cl, Br, CN) stabilized by the [PPh  4  ]  +  and [PPN]  +  cation. The obtained compounds have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. In addition, the behaviour of halide ions in hydrogen fluoride was investigated using experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical methods in order to gain knowledge on the acidity of hydrogen halides in HF.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanism of an Elusive Solvent Effect in Organozinc Reagent Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Solvent effects are often difficult to understand in cases where reaction intermediates, and thus their differential behaviour in different solvents, are not directly observable by traditional ensemble analytical techniques. Herein, the sensitivity of single&#8208;particle fluorescence microscopy uniquely enables direct observation of organozinc intermediates and solvent effects on their build&#8208;up and persistence. When combined with NMR spectroscopy, these imaging data pinpoint the previously elusive mechanistic origin of solvent effects in the synthesis of widely used organozinc reagents. These findings characterize the acceleration of oxidative addition of the starting organoiodide to the surface of zinc metal in DMSO relative to THF, but once formed, surface intermediates display similar persistence in either solvent. The current studies are the first demonstration of a highly sensitive, single&#8208;particle fluorescence microscopy technique to pinpoint otherwise elusive solvent effects in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

The Rh  I  &#8208;NHC&#8208;BHetA compounds catalyze the dimerization of aryl alkynes showing excellent selectivity for the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail enynes. Among them, the acetanilidato&#8208;based catalyst has shown an outstanding catalytic performance reaching unprecedented TOF levels of 2500 h  &#8208;1  with complete selectivity for the gem isomer. Investigation of the reaction mechanism supports a non&#8208;oxidative pathway in which the BHetA ligand behaves as proton shuttle through intermediate  &#954;  1  &#8208;HBHetA species. However, in the presence of pyridine as additive, the identification of the common Rh  III  H(C&#8801;CPh)  2  (IPr)(py)  2  intermediate gives support for an oxidative route.</dc:description>

      <title>Stabilizing DNAzymes through Encapsulation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>DNAzymes are a promising class of bioinspired catalyst; however, their structural instability limits their potential. Herein, we report a method to stabilize DNAzymes by encapsulating them in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) host. This biomimetic mineralization process makes DNAzymes active under a wider range of conditions. We demonstrated the concept by encapsulating hemin&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex (Hemin&#8208;G4) into zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;90 (ZIF&#8208;90), which indeed increases the DNAzyme&#8217;s structural stability. The stabilized DNAzymes show activities in the presence of Exonuclease I, organic solvents, or high temperature. Due to its elevated stability and heterogeneous phase, we are able to perform catalysis under a continuous&#8208;flow condition, and the DNAzyme can be reactivated in situ by introducing K+. Moreover, we found that the encapsulated DNAzyme maintains its high enantiomer selectivity, demonstrated by the sulfoxidation of thioanisole to (S)&#8208;methyl phenyl sulfoxide. This concept of stabilizing DNAzymes expands their potential application in chemical industry.</dc:description>

      <title>Grafting of lanthanum complexes on a functionalised graphene surface : theoretical investigation on Ethylene and 1,3&#8208;Butadiene homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polymerisation.</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to silica and alumina, graphene has received little attention as catalyst support, although it may represent a good candidate in view of its inertness, its good mechanical and thermal properties and its extended &#960; conjugated system. While lanthanide catalysts grafted on silica have been synthetized and theoretically investigated, the grafting mode of La complexes onto graphene surfaces remains unknown. To shed light on this reaction, we report here a computational density functional theory study on the grafting of the [La(N(SiMe3)2)3] compound on graphene &#8208;OH and COOH functionalised surfaces. Similarly to experimental approaches, the Lewis acidity of these two supported complexes has been probed by coordination of triphenylphosphine oxide and compared with that of silica grafted analogues. In order to investigate the role of the graphene support in the catalytic activity of the corresponding grafted systems, we have then computed the homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polymerization reaction of ethylene and 1,3&#8208;butadiene. These compounds efficiently catalyse the ethylene and 1,3&#8208;butadiene homopolymerization, displaying activation barriers which are significantly lower than those reported for silica grafted compounds. The copolymerization reaction has been finally investigated. The results computed show that the high stability of the allylic products prevents the formation of alternating ethylene/butadiene copolymers, allowing the formation of block copolymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Structures of Polyphenylphenanthrenes</title>
      <dc:description>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;Octaphenylphenanthrene (4) and decaphenylphenanthrene (5) were prepared by very short syntheses (two or three steps) from tetraphenylfuran and polybrominated benzene derivatives. The X&#8208;ray structures of compounds 4 and 5 show them to be quite crowded, with the phenanthrene cores twisted by about 40&#176; due to the clash of the C4 and C5 phenyl groups. Compound 4 was resolved by chromatography on a chiral support, and its free energy of activation for racemization was determined to be 24.6 kcal/mol at 40 &#176;C.

      <title>Tuning Aqueous Supramolecular Polymerization by an Acid&#8208;responsive Conformational Switch</title>
      <dc:description>Besides their widespread use in coordination chemistry, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines are known for their ability to undergo  cis&#8208;trans  conformational changes in response to metal ions and acids, which has been primarily investigated at the molecular level. However, the exploitation of such conformational switching in self&#8208;assembly has remained unexplored. Herein, we have pioneered the use of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines as acid&#8208;responsive conformational switches to tune supramolecular polymerization processes. To achieve this goal, we have designed a bipyridine&#8208;based linear bolaamphiphile  1  that forms ordered supramolecular polymers in aqueous media  via  cooperative aromatic and hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, addition of acid (TFA) induces the monoprotonation of the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine moiety, leading to a switch in the molecular conformation from a linear (  trans  ) to a V&#8208;shaped (  cis  ) state. This increase in molecular distortion along with electrostatic repulsions of the positively charged bipyridine&#8208;H  +  units attenuate the aggregation tendency and induces a transformation from long fibers to shorter thinner fibers. Our findings may contribute to opening up new directions in molecular switches and stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulation of ambient light&#8211;induced photocyclization pathway (Norrish&#8208;Yang vs. 6&#960;) by substituent choice</title>
      <dc:description>A series of donor/acceptor chromophores 1d&#8211;3d containing two types of photoresponsive motifs, namely an electron&#8208;deficient BF2&#8208;chelated ketone fused with an electron&#8208;rich thiophene have been synthesized and their photochromic performance are investigated. The results reveal that simple variation of R substituents on the diaryl moiety allows one to control the intramolecular photocyclization mechanism with high photochemical selectivity, e.g., under ambient light, methyl&#8208;substituted 1d and 2d undergo 6&#960; photocyclization, whereas ethyl&#8208;substituted 3d exclusively undergoes Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of Norrish&#8208;Yang cyclization products reveals the formation of four pairs of conformational enantiomers differing in the dihedral angle between benzothiophene and the BF2 core. The UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of 1d&#8211;3d cover a broad visible light region (380&#8211;572 nm), while theoretical calculations reveal that absorption in this region is dominated by the charge transfer (CT) transition from the thiophene&#8208;centered HOMO to the LUMO of the electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated BF2&#8208;chelated unit. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO of these dyes promotes&#160;triplet state generation and self&#8208;photosensitizes intramolecular photocyclization in the visible light region. Three&#8208;dimensional time&#8208;resolved and steady&#8208;state emission spectra of 3d show that the Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization takes place within milliseconds with excellent conversion efficiency (96%).</dc:description>

      <title>How the lanthanide ions affect the addition&#8208;elimination step of methanol dehydrogenases</title>
      <dc:description>The widespread XoxF, a recently discovered methanol dehydrogenase enzyme used by methylotrophic bacteria to oxidize methanol for carbon and energy, requires lanthanide ions for its activity. This enzyme represents an essential component of methanol utilization by both methanol&#8208; and methane&#8208;utilizing bacteria. The present investigation looks on the electronic, energetical and geometrical behavior of the methanol dehydrogenase from  Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum  SolV strictly dependent on early lanthanide metals with +3 oxidation states by examining enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes of all the lanthanides and focusing the attention on the catalytic reaction mechanism of two methanol dehydrogenases having as cofactor europium and ytterbium belonging to the in mid&#8208; and later&#8208; series of the lanthanides, in comparison with the methanol dehydrogenase containing the cerium, one early lanthanide. Our outcomes evidence the influence of the lanthanide contraction effect in all the elementary steps of the catalytic reaction mechanism. This indication may reveal useful to develop new catalytic machineries of enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformations.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The widespread XoxF, a recently discovered methanol dehydrogenase enzyme used by methylotrophic bacteria to oxidize methanol for carbon and energy, requires lanthanide ions for its activity. This enzyme represents an essential component of methanol utilization by both methanol&#8208; and methane&#8208;utilizing bacteria. The present investigation looks on the electronic, energetical and geometrical behavior of the methanol dehydrogenase from  Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum  SolV strictly dependent on early lanthanide metals with +3 oxidation states by examining enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes of all the lanthanides and focusing the attention on the catalytic reaction mechanism of two methanol dehydrogenases having as cofactor europium and ytterbium belonging to the in mid&#8208; and later&#8208; series of the lanthanides, in comparison with the methanol dehydrogenase containing the cerium, one early lanthanide. Our outcomes evidence the influence of the lanthanide contraction effect in all the elementary steps of the catalytic reaction mechanism. This indication may reveal useful to develop new catalytic machineries of enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Stable Homoleptic Organometallic Iron(IV) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>A homoleptic organometallic Fe(IV) complex that is stable in both solution and in the solid state at ambient conditions has been synthesized and isolated as [Fe(phtmeimb)  2  ](PF  6  )  2  (phtmeimb = [phenyl(tris(3&#8208;methylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene))borate]  &#8211;  ). This Fe(IV)  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex was characterized by  1  H NMR, HR&#8208;MS, elemental analysis, scXRD analysis, electrochemistry, M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility. The two latter techniques unequivocally demonstrate that [Fe(phtmeimb)  2  ](PF  6  )  2  is a  triplet  Fe(IV) low&#8208;spin  S  =1 complex in the ground state, in agreement with quantum chemical calculations. The electronic absorption spectrum of [Fe(phtmeimb)  2  ](PF  6  )  2  in acetonitrile shows an intense absorption band in the red and near IR, due to LMCT (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer) excitation. For the first time the excited state dynamics of a Fe(IV) complex was studied and revealed a ~0.8 ps lifetime of the  3  LMCT excited state of [Fe(phtmeimb)  2  ](PF  6  )  2  in acetonitrile.</dc:description>

      <title>Glycerol boosted Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminomethylation reaction, a mechanistic insight</title>
      <dc:description>In this contribution, we report a Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminomethylation reaction of terminal alkenes in glycerol that proceeds efficiently under mild conditions to produce the corresponding amines in relatively high selectivity towards linear amines, moderate to excellent yields using a low catalyst loading (1 mol% [Rh], 2 mol% phosphine) and relative low pressure (H2/CO, 1:1, total pressure 10 bar). This work sheds light on the importance of glycerol in enabling enamine reduction via hydrogen transfer. Moreover, the crucial role of Rh as chemoselective catalyst in the condensation step has been evidenced for the first time in the frame of the hydroaminomethylation reaction by precluding deleterious aldol condensation reactions. The hydroaminomethylation proceeds under a molecular regime; the outcome of catalytically active species into metal&#8208;based nanoparticles renders the catalytic system inactive.</dc:description>

      <title>Trifluorosulfonylation Cascade in Allenols: Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Bis(triflyl)enones</title>

The effortlessness of C&#8211;C bond formation, mild reaction conditions, neither catalysts nor light irradiation, exquisite selectivity, both in terms of functional group tolerance and chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity, converts this trifluorosulfonylation sequence into an appealing protocol for the preparation of novel functionalized enones.

These glycomimetics act as inhibitors of galectins &#8208; human lectins, which are biomedically attractive targets for therapeutic inhibition in e.g. cancerogenesis. The affinity of prepared glycomimetics to galectin&#8208;1 and galectin&#8208;3 was studied in ELISA&#8208;type assay and their potential to inhibit galectin binding on the cell surface was shown. There we used our original  in vivo  biotinylated galectin constructs for easy detection by flow cytometry. The results of biological experiments were compared with data from molecular modeling with both galectins.

      <dc:description>In this work, the change of reactivity induced by the introduction of two para&#8208;ethynyl substituents (CCSi(iPr)3 or CCH) to the organic electron donor 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(tetramethylguanidino)&#8208;benzene is evaluated. The redox&#8208;properties and redox&#8208;state dependent fluorescence are evaluated, and dinuclear CuI and CuII complexes synthesized. The Lewis&#8208;acidic B(C6F5)3 substitutes the proton of the ethynyl &#8208;CCH groups to give new anionic &#8208;CCB(C6F5)3&#8208; substituents, leading eventually to a novel dianionic strong electron donor in its diprotonated form. Its two&#8208;electron oxidation with dioxygen in the presence of a copper catalyst yields the first redox&#8208;active guanidine that is neutral (instead of cationic) in its oxidized form.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, the change of reactivity induced by the introduction of two para&#8208;ethynyl substituents (CCSi(iPr)3 or CCH) to the organic electron donor 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(tetramethylguanidino)&#8208;benzene is evaluated. The redox&#8208;properties and redox&#8208;state dependent fluorescence are evaluated, and dinuclear CuI and CuII complexes synthesized. The Lewis&#8208;acidic B(C6F5)3 substitutes the proton of the ethynyl &#8208;CCH groups to give new anionic &#8208;CCB(C6F5)3&#8208; substituents, leading eventually to a novel dianionic strong electron donor in its diprotonated form. Its two&#8208;electron oxidation with dioxygen in the presence of a copper catalyst yields the first redox&#8208;active guanidine that is neutral (instead of cationic) in its oxidized form.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;allyl&#160;complexes bearing N&#8208;trifluoromethyl N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes:a new generation of anticancer agents&#160;which restrain the growth of high grade serous ovarian cancer tumoroids</title>
      <dc:description>The first palladium organometallic compounds bearing N&#8208;trifluoromethyl N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes have been synthesized.

These &#951;  3  &#8208;allyl complexes are potent antiproliferative agents against different cancer lines (the most part of IC  50  falls in the range of 0.02&#8208;0.5 &#956;M) and by choosing PTA as co&#8208;ligand, we can improve the selectivity toward tumor cells, whereas the introduction of 2&#8208;methyl substituents generally slightly reduces the antitumor activity.

A series of biochemical assays, aimed at defining the cellular targets of these palladium complexes, has shown that mitochondria are damaged before DNA, therefore revealing a behavior substantially different from that of cisplatin and derivatives.

We assume that the specific mechanism of action of these organometallic compounds involves the nucleophilic attack on the &#951;  3  &#8208;allyl fragment.

The effectiveness of the representative complex  4c  has been verified on ovarian cancer tumoroids derived from patients. The results are promising: contrary to carboplatin, our compound resulted very active and showed a low toxicity toward normal liver organoids.</dc:description>

      <title>Spiropyran meets guanine quadruplexes: Isomerization mechanism and DNA binding modes of quinolizidine&#8208;substituted spiropyran probes</title>
      <dc:description>The recent delivery of a fluorescent quinolizidine&#8208;substituted spiropyran, which is able to switch in vivo and bind to guanine quadruplexes (G4) at physiological pH values, urged us to elucidate its molecular switching and binding mechanism. Combining multiscale dynamical studies and accurate quantum chemical calculations, we show that, both in water and in the G4 environment, the switching of the spiropyran ring is not promoted by an initial protonation event &#8211;as expected by the effect of low pH solutions&#8212; but that the deprotonated merocyanine form is an intermediate of the reaction leading to the protonated open species. Additionally, we investigate the binding of both deprotonated and protonated open forms of merocyanine to c&#8208;MYC G4s. Both species bind to G4s albeit with different hydrogen&#8208;bond patterns and provide distinct rotamers around the exocyclic double bond of the merocyanine forms. Altogether, our study sheds light on the pharmacophoric points for the binding of these probes to DNA, and thereby, contributes to future developments of new G4 binders of the remarkable family of quinolizidine&#8208;substituted spiropyrans.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing the CO2&#8208;electroreduction of Fe/Ni&#8208;pentlandite Catalysts by S/Se exchange</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO  2  &#160;is an attractive strategy towards the mitigation of environmental pollution and production of bulk chemicals as well as fuels by renewables. The bimetallic sulfide Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  8&#160;  (pentlandite) was recently reported as a cheap and robust catalyst for electrochemical water splitting, as well as for CO  2  &#160;reduction with a solvent&#8208;dependent product selectivity. Inspired by numerous reports&#160; on&#160; monometallic sulfoselenides and selenides revealing higher catalytic activity for the CO  2  &#160;reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) than their sulfide counterparts, we herein investigated the influence of stepwise S/Se exchange in seleno&#8209;pentlandites Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  8&#8209;Y  Se  Y  &#160;(Y=1&#8209;5) and their ability to act as CO  2  &#160;reducing catalysts. We herein demonstrate that the incorporation of higher equivalents of selenium favors the CO  2  RR with Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  4  Se  4  &#160;revealing the highest activity for CO formation. Under galvanostatic conditions in acetonitrile, Fe  4.5  Ni  4.5  S  4  Se  4&#160;  generates CO with a Faradaic Efficiency close to 100% at an applied current densities&#160;of&#160;&#8208;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1 00&#160;mA&#160;cm  &#8208;2  .

      <title>Formal C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Unactivated Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage carboxylation: Regioselective C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated arenes is now possible. C&#8722;H carboxylation can be realized in green solvents and can be used for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of practically valuable molecules.







Abstract
A formal C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated arenes using CO2 in green solvents is described. The present strategy combines a sterically controlled Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation followed by a Cu&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of the in situ generated organoboronates. The reaction is highly regioselective for the C&#8722;H carboxylation of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted benzenes, 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;symmetrically substituted benzenes, fluorinated benzenes and different heterocycles. The developed methodology was applied to the late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H carboxylation of commercial drugs and ligands.

Abstract
This work reveals that photoanodes based on TiNb2O7 (TNO) powder show remarkable water&#8208;oxidation properties including nearly ideal charge&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;injection efficiencies. Furthermore, using a simplified photoanode construction and carefully surveying the structural and morphological characteristics of oriented and polycrystalline thin films and powder&#8208;based samples revealed that the water&#8208;splitting kinetics of TNO is negligibly effected by surface morphology; instead, internal grain boundaries likely play a driving role. The current powder&#8208;based TNO photoanodes exhibit ideal water&#8208;oxidation kinetics and oxidize water at minimal applied biases under illumination; consequently, TNO exhibits an early onset photocurrent voltage (0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) that rivals that of other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoanode materials.

      <title>A Supramolecular Model for the Co&#8208;Catalytic Role of Nitro Compounds in Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nitro compounds are known to change reaction rates and kinetic concentration dependence of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Yet, no mechanistic model exists to account for these observations. Herein we present an atomistic model for the catalytically active form for an alcohol dehydroazidation reaction, generated by DFT calculations. which consists of an H&#8208;bonded aggregate of two molecules of Br&#248;nsted acid and two molecules of nitro compound. The computed O&#8208;H stretching frequencies for the aggregate indicate they are stronger acids than the individual acid molecules and serve as excellent predictors for experimental reaction rates. Applying the model to a chemically diverse set of potential promoters, we predicted and verified experimentally that sulfate esters induce a similar co&#8208;catalytic effect. The important implication is that Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalysis must be viewed from a supramolecular perspective that accounts for not only the pKa of the acid and the bulk properties of a solvent, but also the weak interactions between all molecules in solution.</dc:description>

Herein we present an atomistic model for the catalytically active form for an alcohol dehydroazidation reaction, generated by DFT calculations. which consists of an H&#8208;bonded aggregate of two molecules of Br&#248;nsted acid and two molecules of nitro compound. The computed O&#8208;H stretching frequencies for the aggregate indicate they are stronger acids than the individual acid molecules and serve as excellent predictors for experimental reaction rates. Applying the model to a chemically diverse set of potential promoters, we predicted and verified experimentally that sulfate esters induce a similar co&#8208;catalytic effect. The important implication is that Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalysis must be viewed from a supramolecular perspective that accounts for not only the pKa of the acid and the bulk properties of a solvent, but also the weak interactions between all molecules in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Single peptide backbone surrogate mutations to regulate angiotensin GPCR subtype selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Mutating the side&#8208;chains of amino acids in a peptide ligand, with unnatural amino acids, aiming to mitigate its short half&#8208;life is an established approach. However, we hypothesized that mutating specific backbone peptide bonds with bioisosters can be exploited not only to enhance the proteolytic stability of parent peptides, but also to tune its receptor subtype selectivity. Towards this end, we synthesized four [Y]  6  &#8208;Angiotensin II analogs where amide bonds have been replaced by 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole isosteres in four different backbone locations. All the analogs possessed enhanced stability in human plasma in comparison with the parent peptide, whereas only two of them achieved enhanced AT  2  R/AT  1  R subtype selectivity. This diversification has been studied through 2D NMR spectroscopy and unveiled a putative more structured microenvironment for the two selective ligands accompanied with increased number of NOE cross&#8208;peaks. The most potent analog, compound 2, has been explored regarding its neurotrophic potential and resulted in an enhanced neurite growth with respect to the established agent C21.</dc:description>

      <title>Aggregation and amyloidogenicity of nuclear coactivator binding domain of CREB&#8208;binding protein.</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD) of transcriptional co&#8208;regulator CREB&#8208;binding protein (CBP) is an example of conformationally malleable protein that can bind to structurally unrelated protein targets and adopt distinct folds in the respective protein complexes.

      <title>Borosulfates&#8212;Synthesis and Structural Chemistry of Silicate Analogue Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
Borosulfates are structurally similar to silicates. Their anionic subunits consist of alternating (SO4) and (BO4) tetrahedra forming oligomers, single and multiple chains, layers and extended 3D network structures. The review deals with detailed reports on the different synthesis strategies, the crystal chemistry of borosulfates in comparison to silicates, and their hitherto identified properties.







Abstract
Borosulfates are oxoanionic compounds consisting of condensed sulfur&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered tetrahedra. Hitherto, they were mostly achieved from solvothermal syntheses in SO3&#8208;enriched sulfuric acid, or from reactions with the superacid H[B(HSO4)4]. The crystal structures are very similar to those of the corresponding class of silicates and their substitution variants, especially regarding the typical structural motif of corner&#8208;sharing tetrahedra. However, the borosulfates are supposed to be even more versatile, because (BO3) units might also be part of the anionic network. The following article deals with detailed reports on the different synthesis strategies, the crystal chemistry of borosulfates in comparison to silicates, and their hitherto identified properties.

      <dc:description>Because of their rigidity, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have become a significant building block in molecular materials chemistry. Fusion or doping of boron into PAHs is known to improve the optoelectronic properties by reducing the LUMO energy level. Herein, we report a comprehensive study on the syntheses, structures, and photophysical properties of a new class of fused&#160; N &#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHBs), pyrene&#8208; and benzene&#8208;linked in a "Janus&#8208;type" fashion ( 2&#8208;4 ,&#160; 6&#8208;9,&#160; and 11 ). Remarkably, these examples of fused NHBs display fluorescent properties, and collectively their emission spans the visible spectrum. The&#160; pyrene&#8208;fused NHBs all display blue fluorescence, as the excitations are dominated by the pyrene core. In notable contrast, the emission properties of the benzene&#8208;fused analogues are highly tunable and is dependent on the electronics of the NHB fragments (i.e., the functional group directly bound to the boron atoms).&#160; Pyrene&#8208;fused&#160; 2 &#8208; 4 and&#160; 11 represent the only molecules in which the K&#8208;region of pyrene is functionalized with NHB units , and while they exhibit distorted (twisted or stair&#8208;stepped) pyrene cores, benzene&#8208;fused 6 &#8208; 9 are planar.&#160; The electronic structure and optical properties of these materials were probed by computational studies, including an evaluation of&#160; aromaticity, electronic transitions, and molecular orbitals.</dc:description>

      <title>Improving Broadband White&#8208;light Emission Performances of 2D Perovskites by Subtly Regulating Organic Cations</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted intensive attentions in solid state luminous fields as single&#8208;component white light emitters, and it is still significant to rationally optimize the photoluminescence (PL) performances through accurate structural design strategies. Herein, by carefully choosing homologous aliphatic amines as templates, we rationally designed two isotypical perovskites, [DMEDA]PbCl  4  (  1  ) and [DMPDA]PbCl  4  (  2  ), displaying tunable and stable broadband bluish white&#8208;light emission properties. Intriguingly, the subtle regulation on organic cations leads to higher distortion levels of 2D [PbCl  4  ]  2&#8208;  layers and enhanced photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) (&lt;1% for  1  and 4.9% for  2  ). The broadband light emissions can be ascribed to the self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) based on detailed studies of structural characterizations, time&#8208;resolved PL, temperature&#8208;dependent PL emissions, theoretical calculation and so on. This work gives a new guidance to rationally optimize the PL properties of low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites and affords a platform to probe into the structure&#8208;property relationship.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of a Potent &#945;&#8208;Thrombin Binding Aptamer Incorporating Hexitol Nucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>the replacement of one or more nucleotide residues in the potent &#945;&#8208;thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer NU172 with hexitol&#8208;based nucleotides has been devised, studying the effect of these substitutions on the physicochemical and functional properties of the anticoagulant agent. The incorporation of single hexitol nucleotides at T9 and G18 positions of NU172 substantially retained the physicochemical features of the parent oligonucleotide, as a result of the biomimetic properties of the hexitol backbone. Importantly, the NU172&#8208;  T  H  9 mutant exhibited a higher binding affinity toward human &#945;&#8208;thrombin than the native aptamer and an improved stability even after 24 h in 90% human serum, with a significant increase in the estimated half&#8208;life. The anticoagulant activity of the modified oligonucleotide was also found as slightly preferable than NU172. Overall, these results confirm the potential of hexitol nucleotides as biomimetic agents, while laying the foundations for the development of NU172&#8208;inspired &#945;&#8208;thrombin&#8208;binding aptamers.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical Nanoflower Arrays of Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2 on Nickel Foam: Highly Efficient Binder&#8208;free Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting Application</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we have explored the synthesis of highly efficient Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2&#160;based hierarchical nanoflower arrays on nickel foam (NF) through the one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method (Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2/NF) for overall water splitting applications.&#160;&#160;The overpotentials exhibited by this system at 25 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;are nearly 277 and 102 mV for HER and OER, respectively in 1 M KOH solution. Subsequently, the overall water splitting was performed in 1 M KOH solution by employing Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2/NF as both the anode and cathode electrodes, where the system required only 1.49, 1.60 and 1.69 V to deliver the current densities of 10, 25, and 50 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. Comparison of the activity of Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2/NF with the&#160;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;Pt/C and RuO2&#160;coated on NF displays an enhanced performance for Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2/NF both in the half&#8208;cell as well as in the full cell, emphasizing the significance of the present work.&#160;&#160;Overall, the activity modulation achieved in the present case is attributed to the presence of open&#8208;pore morphology of the as formed nanoflowers of Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2&#160;on NF and the simultaneous presence of the surface Co(OH)2&#160;along with the highly conducting Co9S8&#8208;Ni3S2&#160;core which facilitates the adsorption of the reactants and subsequently its conversion into the gases products during water electrolysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Amino Acids and Fluorinated Motifs as Prominent Traits in the Modern Pharmaceuticals</title>
      <dc:description>Structural analysis of modern pharmaceutical practices allows for the identification of two rapidly growing trends: the introduction of tailor&#8208;made amino acids and the exploitation of fluorinated motifs. Quite curiously, the former represents one of the most ubiquitous classes of naturally occurring compounds while the latter is the most xenobiotic, comprised virtually entirely of man&#8208;made derivatives. In this review, we profile 39 selected compounds featuring both of these traits in the same molecule.

      <title>Sterubin: enantioresolution and configurational stability, enantiomeric purity in nature, and neuroprotective activity in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD) is a neurological disorder with still no preventive or curative treatment. Flavonoids are phytochemicals with potential therapeutic value. Previous studies described the flavanone sterubin isolated from the Californian plant Eriodictyon californicum as a potent neuroprotectant in several in vitro assays. Herein, we describe the resolution of synthetic racemic sterubin (1) into its two enantiomers, (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1, on a chiral chromatographic phase and their stereochemical assignment online, by HPLC&#8208;ECD coupling. (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1 showed comparable neuroprotection in vitro with no significant differences. While the pure stereoisomers were configurationally stable in methanol, fast racemization was observed in the presence of culture medium. We also established the occurrence of extracted sterubin as its pure (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Moreover, we investigated the activity of sterubin (1) for the first time in vivo, in an AD mouse model. Sterubin (1) showed a significant positive impact on short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory at low dosages.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD) is a neurological disorder with still no preventive or curative treatment. Flavonoids are phytochemicals with potential therapeutic value. Previous studies described the flavanone sterubin isolated from the Californian plant Eriodictyon californicum as a potent neuroprotectant in several in vitro assays. Herein, we describe the resolution of synthetic racemic sterubin (1) into its two enantiomers, (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1, on a chiral chromatographic phase and their stereochemical assignment online, by HPLC&#8208;ECD coupling. (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1 showed comparable neuroprotection in vitro with no significant differences. While the pure stereoisomers were configurationally stable in methanol, fast racemization was observed in the presence of culture medium. We also established the occurrence of extracted sterubin as its pure (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Moreover, we investigated the activity of sterubin (1) for the first time in vivo, in an AD mouse model. Sterubin (1) showed a significant positive impact on short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory at low dosages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Cross&#8208;linked polymers as scaffolds for the low temperature preparation of nanostructured metal oxides</title>
      <dc:description>The current state of the art of the use of crosslinked organic polymers, both insoluble (resins or gels) and soluble (micro&#8208; and nanogels), as aid for the low&#8208;temperature preparation of stable metal oxide nanoparticles or nanostructured metal oxides is reviewed herein. Synthetic strategies for inorganic oxide nanomaterials of this kind can greatly benefit from the use of crosslinked polymers, which may act as scaffolds/exotemplates during inorganic nanoparticle synthesis or as stabilizers following postsynthetic modification of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the peculiar properties of the organic crosslinked polymers add to those of the inorganic oxide nanoparticles, producing materials with combined properties. The potential applications of such highly promising composite nanomaterials will be also briefly sketched.

      <title>Bismuth Oxide decorated Graphene Oxide Hybrids for Catalytic and Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Global warming challenges aggregate demand to develop an efficient catalytic system for the reduce CO2, which significantly contributes to the control of climate change. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized bismuth oxide decorated graphene oxide (Bi2O3@GO) has been used as an electro/thermal catalyst for CO2 reduction. Bi2O3@GO was found to be uniformly distributed and confirmed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) exhibits the Bi2O3 has the &#946;&#8208;phase with 23.4 m2/g BET surface area. Significantly, the D and G bands from Raman spectroscopic analysis and their intensity (ID/IG) ratio have been revealed the increment in defective sites on GO after the surface decoration. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis clearly shows signals for Bi, C and O, along with their oxidation states. The ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&#8208;0.534 V vs. RHE) for the reduction of CO2 on Bi2O3@GO has been achieved. Furthermore, potential dependent (&#8208;0.534, &#8208;0.734 and &#8208;0.934 vs. RHE) bulk electrolysis of CO2 to formate provides Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of ~ 39.72, ~ 61.48 and ~83.00% respectively. Additionally, the time&#8208;dependent electrolysis at a poteintial of &#8208;0.934 vs. RHE for 3 and 5h observed FEs are ~ 84.20% and ~ 87.17% respectively.

Herein, for the first time, we use low cost oleic acid as single carbon source, and add commercial SiO  2  as template to form porous structure while introducing  Fe(NO  3  )  3  and Ni(NO  3  )  2  as catalysts to increase the degree of graphitization.

Thanks to the well&#8208;developed porous structure with high graphitization degree, the highly  graphitized porous carbon  &#8208;  FeNi  3  (  GPC&#8208;FeNi  3  ) materials have high conductivity to ensure fast charge transfer while hierarchically porous structure facilitates ion diffusion and traps polysulfide.

      <title>Correlating Solution&#8208; and Solid&#8208;State Structures of Conformationally Flexible Resorcinarenes: Significance of a Sulfonyl Group in Intramolecular Self&#8208;Inclusion</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;inclusion: An intramolecular self&#8208;inclusion complex of a flexible resorcinarene podand stabilised by weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions has been observed in both the crystal structure and in solution (see figure). The solid&#8208;state conformation was determined by XRD and the conformation in solution was investigated by NMR and computational methods, with good agreement observed between the different techniques.







Abstract
The synthesis of tetramethoxyresorcinarene podands bearing p&#8208;toluene arms connected by &#8208;SO3&#8208; (1) and &#8208;CH2O&#8208; (2) linkers is presented herein. In the solid state, the resorcinarene podand 1 forms an intramolecular self&#8208;inclusion complex with the pendant p&#8208;toluene group of a podand arm, whereas the resorcinarene podand 2 does not show self&#8208;inclusion. The conformations of the flexible resorcinarene podands in solution were investigated by variable&#8208;temperature experiments using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques as well as by computational methods, including a conformational search and subsequent DFT optimisation of representative structures. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of 1 and 2 at room temperature show a single set of proton signals that are in agreement with C4v symmetry. At low temperatures, the molecules exist as a mixture of boat conformations featuring slow exchange on the NMR timescale. Energy barriers (&#916;G&#8800;298) of 55.5 and 52.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 were calculated for the boat&#8208;to&#8208;boat exchange of 1 and 2, respectively. The results of the ROESY experiments performed at 193&#8197;K and computational modelling suggest that in solution the resorcinarene podand 1 adopts a similar conformation to that present in its crystal structure, whereas podand 2 populates a more versatile range of conformations in solution.

Melams, which are derivatives of bis(4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine, can form multiple intermolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and serve as modules for constructing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).

      <title>Electrocatalytic Proton Reduction by a Cobalt Complex Containing a Proton Responsive Bis(alkylimdazole)methane Ligand: Involvement of a C&#8211;H Bond in H2 Formation</title>
      <dc:description>Homogeneous electrocatalytic proton reduction is reported using cobalt complex [  1  ](BF  4  )  2  . This complex comprises two bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane (HBMIM  Ph2  ) ligands that contain an acidic methylene moiety in their backbone. Upon reduction of [  1  ](BF  4  )  2  by either electrochemical or chemical means, one of its HBMIM  Ph2  ligands undergoes deprotonation under the formation of dihydrogen. Addition of a mild proton source (acetic acid) to deprotonated complex [  2  ](BF  4  ) regenerates protonated complex [  1  ](BF  4  )  2  . In presence of acetic acid in acetonitrile solvent [  1  ](BF  4  )  2  shows electrocatalytic proton reduction with a k  obs  of ~200 s  &#8208;1  at an overpotential of 590 mV. Mechanistic investigations supported by Density Functional Theory (BP86) reveal that dihydrogen formation takes place in an intramolecular fashion through the participation of a methylene C&#8211;H bond of the HBMIM  Ph2  ligand and a Co  II  &#8211;H bond through formal heterolytic splitting of the latter. These results represent the joint involvement of a base metal&#8208;hydride and a C&#8211;H bond in electrocatalytic proton reduction and are of interest to the development of responsive ligands for molecular (base)metal (electro)catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Ring Enlargement of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Treatment with In Situ Formed Tricyanomethane
</title>
      <dc:description>
Hidden acid: Cyanoform, which is generated in situ from azidomethylidene&#8208;malonodinitrile or other precursors, induces ring&#8208;expansion reactions of epoxides, thiirane, aziridines, or 2H&#8208;azirines. The transformations are always initiated through protonation of the heteroatom X by cyanoform, but lead to the five&#8208;membered heterocycles through different mechanisms (see scheme).







Abstract
Although the chemistry of elusive tricyanomethane (cyanoform) has been studied during a period of more than 150&#8197;years, this compound has very rarely been utilized in the synthesis or modification of heterocycles. Three&#8208;membered heterocycles, such as epoxides, thiirane, aziridines, or 2H&#8208;azirines, are now treated with tricyanomethane, which is generated in situ by heating azidomethylidene&#8208;malonodinitrile in tetrahydrofuran at 45&#8201;&#176;C or by adding sulfuric acid to potassium tricyanomethanide. This leads to ring expansion with formation of 2&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)oxazolidine derivatives or creation of the corresponding thiazolidine, imidazolidine, or imidazoline compounds and opens up a new access to these push&#8211;pull&#8208;substituted olefinic products. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry of the ring&#8208;enlargement processes are discussed, and the proposed reaction mechanisms were confirmed by using 15N&#8208;labeled substrates. It turns out that different mechanisms are operating; however, tricyanomethanide is always acting as a nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophile, which is quite unusual if compared to other reactions of this species.

Sheets and tubes: The syntheses of amphiphilic 5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrachlorobenzimidacarbocyanine dye derivatives with aminopropanediol head groups, which only differ in stereochemistry (chiral enantiomers, meso form and conformer), are reported.

Abstract
The syntheses of novel amphiphilic 5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrachlorobenzimidacarbocyanine (TBC) dye derivatives with aminopropanediol head groups, which only differ in stereochemistry (chiral enantiomers, meso form and conformer), are reported. For the achiral meso form, a new synthetic route towards asymmetric cyanine dyes was established. All compounds form J aggregates in water, the optical properties of which were characterised by means of spectroscopic methods. The supramolecular structure of the aggregates is investigated by means of cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy, cryo&#8208;electron tomography and AFM, revealing extended sheet&#8208;like aggregates for chiral enantiomers and nanotubes for the mesomer, respectively, whereas the conformer forms predominately needle&#8208;like crystals. The experiments demonstrate that the aggregation behaviour of compounds can be controlled solely by head group stereochemistry, which in the case of enantiomers enables the formation of extended hydrogen&#8208;bond chains by the hydroxyl functionalities. In case of the achiral meso form, however, such chains turned out to be sterically excluded.

      <title>A Cornucopia of Iridium Nitrogen Compounds Produced from Laser&#8208;Ablated Iridium Atoms and Dinitrogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Iridium and nitrogen: This work presents the last missing homoleptic dinitrogen and nitrido complexes of the platinum&#8208;group metals and helps understanding the interaction of nitrogen with metals to facilitate nitrogen fixation. Dinitrogen activation, oxidation states and bond orders are discussed and give insight to the reactivity and electronic structure of these intriguing compounds.







Abstract
The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated iridium atoms with dinitrogen molecules and nitrogen atoms yield several neutral and ionic iridium dinitrogen complexes such as Ir(N2), Ir(N2)+, Ir(N2)2, Ir(N2)2&#8722;, IrNNIr, as well as the nitrido complexes IrN, Ir(N)2 and IrIrN. These reaction products were deposited in solid neon, argon and nitrogen matrices and characterized by their infrared spectra. Assignments of vibrational bands are supported by ab initio and first principle calculations as well as 14/15N isotope substitution experiments. The structural and electronic properties of the new dinitrogen and nitrido iridium complexes are discussed. While the formation of the elusive dinitrido complex Ir(N)2 was observed in a subsequent reaction of IrN with N atoms within the cryogenic solid matrices, the threefold coordinated iridium trinitride Ir(N)3 could not be observed so far.

      <title>Quantification of the Interaction of SmI2 with Substrates and Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
A measurement tool: The method described herein allows for both: 1)&#8197;a quantitative determination of the interaction of SmI2 with substrates prior to the electron transfer step and 2)&#8197;an accurate determination of the first equilibrium constants for the coordination of various ligands with this reagent.







Abstract
The method developed and introduced here enables for the first time (to the authors&#8217; knowledge), a quantitative assessment of the interaction of SmI2 with substrates prior to the electron transfer stage. As a proof of concept, equilibrium constants for some model substrates including carbonyl compounds and aromatic nuclei are reported here. In addition, the first equilibrium constants with some common ligands were also determined. The equilibrium constants range from approximately 0.07&#8201;m&#8722;1 for diisopropyl ketone to 2500&#8201;m&#8722;1 for hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). It is shown that the data acquired by this method, which is based on the concept of shift reagents, can shed light on the most intimate details of the reaction mechanism, and this method is a useful tool for planning a synthetic process.

      <title>Carbon Nitride as a Ligand: Selective Hydrogenation of Terminal Alkenes Using [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)IrCl(g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;&#954;2N,N&#8217;)]Cl</title>
      <dc:description>
Bulky solid ligand: Selective catalytic hydrogenation of terminal alkenes is observed when [Cp*IrCl]+ is supported on g&#8208;C3N4. Direct coordination of [Cp*IrCl]+ to g&#8208;C3N4 occurs via &#954;2N,N&#8217; binding and is limited to exposed edge sites. The restricted steric environment at the Ir atom results in slow but highly selective catalysis.







Abstract
Anchoring a homogeneous catalyst onto a heterogeneous support facilitates separation of the product from the catalyst, and catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions can also modify reactivity. Herein we describe the synthesis of composite materials comprising carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) as the heterogeneous support and the well&#8208;established homogeneous catalyst moiety [Cp*IrCl]+ (where Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), commonly used for catalytic hydrogenation. Coordination of [Cp*IrCl]+ to g&#8208;C3N4 occurs directly at exposed edge sites with a &#954;2N,N&#8217; binding motif, leading to a primary inner coordination sphere analogous to known homogeneous complexes of the general class [Cp*IrCl(NN&#8208;&#954;2N,N&#8217;)]+ (where N,N&#8217;=a bidentate nitrogen ligand). Hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates using the composite catalyst is selective for terminal alkenes, which is attributed to the restricted steric environment of the outer coordination sphere at the edge&#8208;sites of g&#8208;C3N4.

      <title>Heterogeneous Olefin Hydrogenation Enabled by a Highly&#8208;Reduced Nickel(&#8722;II) Catalyst Precursor</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;reduced olefin nickelate complex has been used as a catalyst precursor of the hydrogenation of sterically hindered olefins. The cover image shows how the pre&#8208;catalyst is converted into catalytically active nickel nanoparticles, which were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic potential of these particles is demonstrated by the hydrogenation of 1,1&#8242;,2&#8208;triphenylethylene under mild conditions (cover design: Julia Leitl). More information can be found in the Communication by R.&#8197;Wolf et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905537).

      <dc:description>
Afterglow for bioimaging: The auto&#8208;fluorescence problem of living cells during bioimaging can potentially be solved by using novel magnetic&#8211;afterglow nanoparticles.







Abstract
Afterglow&#8211;magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) offer enormous potential for bioimaging applications, as they can be manipulated by a magnetic field, as well as emitting light after irradiation with an excitation source, thus distinguishing themselves from fluorescent living cells. In this work, a novel double core&#8211;shell strategy is presented, uniting co&#8208;precipitation with combustion synthesis routes to combine an Fe3O4 magnetic core (&#8776;15&#8197;nm) with an afterglow SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ outer coat (&#8776;10&#8197;nm), and applying a SiO2 protective middle layer (&#8776;16&#8197;nm) to reduce the luminescence quenching caused by the Fe core ions. The resulting Fe3O4@SiO2@SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ NPs emit green light attributed to the 4f65d1&#8594;4f7(8S7/2) transition of Eu2+ under UV radiation and for a few seconds afterwards. This bifunctional nanocomposite can potentially be applied for the detection and separation of cells or diagnostically relevant molecules.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)&#8208;Based Planar Chiral Bent Cyclophanes by Rhodium&#8208; Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)&#8208;based planar chiral cyclophanes was achieved for the first time by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular regio&#8208; and enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered diyne&#8208; benzofulvenes followed by stepwise oxidative transformations. The thus synthesized p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208; and 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;based planar chiral bent cyclophanes were converted to 9&#8208;fluorenol&#8208;based ones with excellent ee values of &gt;99% by diastereoselective 1,2&#8208;reduction. These 9&#8208;fluorenol&#8208;based cyclophanes exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields, which were significantly higher than that of an acyclic reference molecule (78&#8211;82% vs. 48%). The bending effect on the chiroptical property was also examined, which revealed that the anisotropy factors (gabs values) for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) of these 9&#8208;fluorenol&#8208;based planar chiral bent cyclophanes increase as the tether length becomes shorter.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here, we report a  simple  and green quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase (QSP) method  for facile synthesis of proton&#8208;type ZSM&#8208;5 avoiding use of excessive water, dry gel,  Na  +  cation and fluoride. Crystallization using the stoichiometric amount of TPAOH at 180 &#176;C for only 12 h yields well&#8208;structured HZSM&#8208;5 crystals having high specific surface area of 429 m  2  /g and high thermal stability. 5MRs is observed to closely relate the formation of MFI structure and QSP method exhibits shorter induction period (  t  0  ), higher nucleation rate (  V  n  ), and faster growth rate (  V  g  ). Moreover, HZ&#8208;12&#8208;180 shows extremely better and rather stable catalytic activity for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction by comparison with commercial HZSM&#8208;5.</dc:description>

      <title>Boronic Acids as Lewis Acid Catalysts: Myth or Reality?</title>
      <dc:description>Boronic acid catalysis has emerged as a mild method for promoting a wide variety of reactions. It has been proposed that the mode of catalysis involves Lewis acid or covalent activation of hydroxyl groups by boron, but limited mechanistic evidence exists. Here, we reinvestigate representative boronic acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alcohols and oximes. We interpret a series of control experiments with boronic and Br&#248;nsted acids along with correlations between their reactivity and their acidity measured by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. Overall, we conclude that the major modes of catalysis involve either dual H&#8208;bond catalysis or Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We show that strong Br&#248;nsted acids are generated in situ from covalent assembly of the boronic acids with hexafluoroisopropanol, explaining why the solvent had such a major impact on the reactivity. This new insight should guide the future development of boronic acid catalysis, where the diverse and solvent&#8208;specific nature of catalytic modes has been overlooked.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the length of cooperative supramolecular polymers with chain&#8208;cappers</title>
      <dc:description>The design and the characterization of supramolecular additives to control the chain length of benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) cooperative supramolecular polymers under thermodynamic equilibrium is unraveled. These additives act as chain&#8208;cappers of supramolecular polymers and feature one face as reactive as the BTA discotic to interact strongly with the polymer&#8208;end, whereas the other face is non&#8208;reactive and therefore impedes further polymerization. Such a design requires fine tuning of the conformational pre&#8208;organization of the amides and the steric hindrance of the motif. The chain&#8208;cappers studied are monotopic derivatives of BTA, modified by partial  N  &#8208;methylation of the amides or by positioning of a bulky cyclotriveratrylene cage on one face of the BTA unit.

      <title>Esterification of Tertiary Amides: Remarkable Additive Effects of Potassium Alkoxides for Generating Hetero Manganese&#8208;Potassium Dinuclear Active Species</title>
      <dc:description>A catalyst system of mononuclear manganese precursor  3  combined with potassium alkoxide served as a superior catalyst compared with our previously reported manganese homodinuclear catalyst  2a  for esterification of not only tertiary aryl amides, but also tertiary aliphatic amides. On the basis of stoichiometric reactions of  3  and potassium alkoxide salt, kinetic studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we clarified a plausible reaction mechanism in which  in situ  generated manganese&#8208;potassium heterodinuclear species cooperatively activate the carbonyl moiety of the amide and the OH moiety of the alcohols. We also revealed the details of the reaction mechanism of our previous manganese homodinuclear system  2a  , and we found that activation free energy (  &#916;G  &#8225;  ) for the manganese&#8208;potassium heterodinuclear complex catalyzed esterification of amides is lower than that for manganese homo dinuclear system, which was consistent with the experimental results.

      <title>Conformation control of conjugated polymers</title>
      <dc:description>In the past few decades, conjugated polymers have aroused extensive interest in organic electronic applications. The electrical performance of conjugated polymers has a close relationship with their backbone conformation. The conformation of the polymer backbone strongly affects the &#960;&#173;electron delocalization along polymer chains, the energy bandgap, interchain interactions, and further affecting charge transport properties.

      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as a unique molecular platform for the formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on various surfaces. However, active carbene formation requires deprotonation of imidazolium salt precursors, which is mostly facilitated by exposure of the salt to exogenous base.

SAMs of nitron were found thermally stable and could not be displaced by thiols, demonstrating their high chemical stability. The addressable amine group in surface&#8208;anchored nitron was shown to be chemically available for SN2 reaction, making the surface&#8208;anchored nitron a chemically&#8208;addressable cross&#8208;linking reagent for surface modifications.</dc:description>

      <title>Stiff&#8208;Stilbene Ligands Target G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA and Exhibit Selective Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity
</title>
      <dc:description>
Stiff scaffolds: Stiff&#8208;stilbene has very recently emerged as a promising scaffold for the design of selective G&#8208;quadruplex DNA ligands. We demonstrate the importance of substituent chemistry and molecular geometry on the activity of this novel ligand series. Compounds exhibit up to 700&#8208;fold selective toxicity to parasitic organisms and 30&#8208;fold selective toxicity to cervical cancer cells over a non&#8208;tumoral mammalian cell model.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex nucleic acid structures have long been studied as anticancer targets whilst their potential in antiparasitic therapy has only recently been recognized and barely explored. Herein, we report the synthesis, biophysical characterization, and in vitro screening of a series of stiff&#8208;stilbene G4 binding ligands featuring different electronics, side&#8208;chain chemistries, and molecular geometries. The ligands display selectivity for G4 DNA over duplex DNA and exhibit nanomolar toxicity against Trypasanoma brucei and HeLa cancer cells whilst remaining up to two orders of magnitude less toxic to non&#8208;tumoral mammalian cell line MRC&#8208;5. Our study demonstrates that stiff&#8208;stilbenes show exciting potential as the basis of selective anticancer and antiparasitic therapies. To achieve the most efficient G4 recognition the scaffold must possess the optimal electronics, substitution pattern and correct molecular configuration.

      <title>Magnesocenophane&#8208;Catalyzed Amine Borane Dehydrocoupling</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnesocenophanes in catalysis: The dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane to cyclic tetramethyldiborazane under ambient conditions, catalyzed by a [1]magnesocenophane, is described. This is the first example of a magnesium&#8208;based catalyst for this reaction that operates at room temperature. Based on experimental investigations and DFT calculations, a ligand&#8208;assisted mechanism involving stepwise proton and hydride transfer is proposed.







Abstract
The Lewis acidities of a series of [n]magnesocenophanes (1&#8201;a&#8211;d) have been investigated computationally and found to be a function of the tilt of the cyclopentadienyl moieties. Their catalytic abilities in amine borane dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling reactions have been probed, and C[1]magnesocenophane (1&#8201;a) has been shown to effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation/dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane (2&#8201;a) and diisopropylamine borane (2&#8201;b) under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism of the reaction with 2&#8201;a has been investigated experimentally and computationally, and the results imply a ligand&#8208;assisted mechanism involving stepwise proton and hydride transfer, with dimethylaminoborane as the key intermediate.

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselectivities of Testosterone and Dihydrotestosterone Hydroxylation Catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP19A1</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective insertion: The results of a theoretical study on the selective hydroxylation of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone by CYP3A4 and CYP19A1 is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
The hydroxylation of nonreactive C&#8722;H bonds can be easily catalyzed by a variety of metalloenzymes, especially cytochrome P450s (P450s). The mechanism of P450 mediated hydroxylation has been intensively studied, both experimentally and theoretically. However, understanding the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of substrates hydroxylated by P450s remains a great challenge. Herein, we use a multi&#8208;scale modeling approach to investigate the selectivity of testosterone (TES) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) hydroxylation catalyzed by two important P450s, CYP3A4 and CYP19A1. For CYP3A4, two distinct binding modes for TES/DHT were predicted by dockings and molecular dynamics simulations, in which the experimentally identified sites of metabolism of TES/DHT can access to the catalytic center. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of TES/DHT hydroxylation were further evaluated by quantum mechanical and ONIOM calculations. For CYP19A1, we found that sites 1&#946;, 2&#946; and 19 can access the catalytic center, with the intrinsic reactivity 2&#946;&gt;1&#946;&gt;19. However, our ONIOM calculations indicate that the hydroxylation is favored at site 19 for both TES and DHT, which is consistent with the experiments and reflects the importance of the catalytic environment in determining the selectivity. Our study unravels the mechanism underlying the selectivity of TES/DHT hydroxylation mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP19A1 and is helpful for understanding the selectivity of other substrates that are hydroxylated by P450s.

      <title>Probing the Electrostatic Barrier of Tetrathiafulvalene Dications using a Tetra&#8208;stable Donor&#8211;Acceptor [2]Rotaxane</title>
      <dc:description>
Control of directionality is of paramount importance if rectified motion in electroactive molecular machines should be realized. As illustrated in the cover artwork, the tetracationic ring (blue) in a tetraoxidized [2]rotaxane can follow two different tracks; it transpires that it is easier for the ring to follow a track in which it has to move across a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene dication (dark green) compared to the track in which it moves across a tetrathiafulvalene dication (light green).

Embedded fucoses: First syntheses of substructures of the O&#8208;polysaccharide of Providencia rustiginii O34 are presented. The repeating unit is a heptasaccharide with seven different monosacchride units (see figure).







Abstract
A general and efficient strategy for synthesis of tri&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and heptasaccharidic substructures of the lipopolysaccharide of Providencia rustigianii O34 is described. For the heptasaccharide seven different building blocks were employed. Special features of the structures are an &#945;&#8208;linked galactosamine and the two embedded &#945;&#8208;fucose units, which are either branched at positions&#8208;3 and &#8208;4 or further linked at their 2&#8208;position. Convergent strategies focused on [4+3], [3+4], and [4+2+1] couplings. Whereas the [4+3] and [3+4] coupling strategies failed the [4+2+1] strategy was successful. As monosaccharidic building blocks trichloroacetimidates and phosphates were employed. Global deprotection of the fully protected structures was achieved by Birch reaction.

      <title>A Microfluidic Co&#8208;Flow Route for Human Serum Albumin&#8208;Drug&#8211;Nanoparticle Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanotechnology: We demonstrate a microfluidic co&#8208;flow device to produce drug&#8208;loaded albumin nanoparticles without additional cross&#8208;linking steps. This method showed high loading efficiency of the lipophilic drug celastrol, which created spherical nanoparticles with considerable reduced drug cytotoxicity (see figure).







Abstract
Nanoparticles are widely studied as carrier vehicles in biological systems because their size readily allows access through cellular membranes. Moreover, they have the potential to carry cargo molecules and as such, these factors make them especially attractive for intravenous drug delivery purposes. Interest in protein&#8208;based nanoparticles has recently gained attraction due to particle biocompatibility and lack of toxicity. However, the production of homogeneous protein nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiencies, without the need for additional cross&#8208;linking or further engineering of the molecule, remains challenging. Herein, we present a microfluidic 3D co&#8208;flow device to generate human serum albumin/celastrol nanoparticles by co&#8208;flowing an aqueous protein solution with celastrol in ethanol. This microscale co&#8208;flow method resulted in the formation of nanoparticles with a homogeneous size distribution and an average size, which could be tuned from &#8776;100&#8197;nm to 1&#8197;&#956;m by modulating the flow rates used. We show that the high stability of the particles stems from the covalent cross&#8208;linking of the naturally present cysteine residues within the particles formed during the assembly step. By choosing optimal flow rates during synthesis an encapsulation efficiency of 75&#177;24&#8201;% was achieved. Finally, we show that this approach achieves significantly enhanced solubility of celastrol in the aqueous phase and, crucially, reduced cellular toxicity.

      <dc:description>
NHO activation: The activation of aromatic C&#8722;F bonds by N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) occurs without the need of any additional catalyst. As a result, a straightforward methodology was developed for the formation of different fluoroaryl&#8208;substituted alkenes.







Abstract
A N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), a terminal alkene selectively activates aromatic C&#8722;F bonds without the need of any additional catalyst. As a result, a straightforward methodology was developed for the formation of different fluoroaryl&#8208;substituted alkenes in which the central carbon&#8211;carbon double bond is in a twisted geometry.

      <title>Magnesocenophane Catalyzed Amine Borane Dehydrocoupling</title>
      <dc:description>
A C[1]magnesocenophane catalyzes the dehydrocoupling reaction of dimethylamine borane to the cyclic tetramethyldiborazane under ambient conditions. While there are many transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts known to facilitate this reaction at room temperature, it is quite remarkable for a magnesium compound, as previous magnesium&#8208;based systems required elevated temperatures. The mechanism has been investigated by experimental and theoretical means and a ligand&#8208;assisted route is proposed. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Sch&#228;fer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000106).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A C[1]magnesocenophane&lt;/b&gt; catalyzes the dehydrocoupling reaction of dimethylamine borane to the cyclic tetramethyldiborazane under ambient conditions. While there are many transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts known to facilitate this reaction at room temperature, it is quite remarkable for a magnesium compound, as previous magnesium&#8208;based systems required elevated temperatures. The mechanism has been investigated by experimental and theoretical means and a ligand&#8208;assisted route is proposed. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Sch&#228;fer et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200010610.1002/chem.202000106&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Ring Enlargement of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Treatment with In Situ Formed Tricyanomethane</title>
      <dc:description>
A ring expansion device for different three&#8208;membered heterocycles is based on tricyanomethane (cyanoform), which is generated in situ by thermal decay of 2,2&#8208;dicyanovinyl azide. The transformations open up a new access to five&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles and simultaneously lead to push&#8211;pull substituted olefins. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry of the ring&#8208;enlargement processes are discussed, and the suggested reaction mechanisms were investigated.

      <title>Probing the Electrostatic Barrier of Tetrathiafulvalene Dications using a Tetra&#8208;stable Donor&#8211;Acceptor [2]Rotaxane</title>
      <dc:description>
A tetra&#8208;stable donor&#8211;acceptor [2]rotaxane, composed of an oxyphenylene (OP), a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), a monopyrrolo&#8208;TTF (MPTTF), and a hydroquinone (HQ) unit in the dumbbell component and encircled by the tetra&#8208;cationic cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) was used to probe the electrostatic barriers for the movement of CBPQT4+ across an MPTTF2+ and a TTF2+ dication.







Abstract
A tetra&#8208;stable donor&#8211;acceptor [2]rotaxane 1&#8901;4PF6 has been synthesized. The dumbbell component is comprised of an oxyphenylene (OP), a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), a monopyrrolo&#8208;TTF (MPTTF), and a hydroquinone (HQ) unit, which can act as recognition sites (stations) for the tetra&#8208;cationic cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+). The TTF and the MPTTF stations are located in the middle of the dumbbell component and are connected by a triethylene glycol (TEG) chain in such a way that the pyrrole moiety of the MPTTF station points toward the TTF station, while the TTF and MPTTF stations are flanked by the OP and HQ stations on their left hand side and right hand side, respectively. The [2]rotaxane was characterized in solution by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The spectroscopic data revealed that the majority (77&#8201;%) of the tetra&#8208;stable [2]rotaxane 14+ exist as the translational isomer 1&#8901;MPTTF4+ in which the CBPQT4+ ring encircles the MPTTF station. The electrochemical studies showed that CBPQT4+ in 1&#8901;MPTTF4+ undergoes ring translation as result of electrostatic repulsion from the oxidized MPTTF unit. Following tetra&#8208;oxidation of 1&#8901;MPTTF4+, a high&#8208;energy state of 18+ was obtained (i.e., 1&#8901;TEG8+) in which the CBPQT4+ ring was located on the TEG linker connecting the di&#8208;oxidized TTF2+ and MPTTF2+ units. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy carried out in CD3CN at 298&#8197;K on a chemically oxidized sample of 1&#8901;MPTTF4+ revealed that the metastable state 1&#8901;TEG8+ is only short&#8208;lived with a lifetime of a few minutes and it was found that 70&#8201;% of the positively charged CBPQT4+ ring moved from 1&#8901;TEG8+ to the HQ station, while 30&#8201;% moved to the much weaker OP station. These results clearly demonstrate that the CBPQT4+ ring can cross both an MPTTF2+ and a TTF2+ electrostatic barrier and that the free energy of activation required to cross MPTTF2+ is ca. 0.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 smaller as compared to TTF2+.

      <title>Approaching Dissolved Species in Ammonoacidic GaN Crystal Growth: A Combined Solution NMR and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials synthesis: A combination of solution NMR in liquid ammonia with quantum mechanical and molecular modelling allows identifying the dissolved species and their mineralizer concentration dependent solubility in ammonoacidic solutions with relevance for GaN crystal growth (see figure).







Abstract
Solutions of gallium trihalides GaX3 (X=F, Cl, Br, I) and their ammoniates in liquid ammonia were studied at ambient temperature under autogenous pressure by multinuclear (71Ga, 35Cl, 81Br) NMR spectroscopy. To unravel the role of pH, the analyses were done both in absence and in presence of ammonium halides, which are employed as mineralizers during ammonoacidic gallium nitride crystal growth. While gallium trifluoride and its ammoniate were found to be too sparingly soluble to give rise to a NMR signal, the spectra of solutions of the heavier halides reveal the presence of a single gallium&#8208;containing species in all cases. DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations suggest the identification of this species as consisting of a [Ga(NH3)6]3+ cation and up to six surrounding halide anions, resulting in an overall trend towards negative complex charge. Quantitative 71Ga&#8197;NMR studies on saturated solutions of GaCl3 containing various amounts of additional NH4Cl revealed a near linear increase of GaCl3 solubility with mineralizer concentration of about 0.023&#8197;mol GaCl3 per mol NH4Cl at room temperature. These findings reflect the importance of Coulombic shielding for the inhibition of oligomerization and precipitation processes and help to rationalize both the low solubility of gallium halides in neutral ammonia solution and, in turn, the proliferating effect of the mineralizer during ammonoacidic gallium nitride formation.

      <title>Synthesis and Assembly of Zinc Oxide Microcrystals by a Low&#8208;Temperature Dissolution&#8211;Reprecipitation Process: Lessons Learned About Twin Formation in Heterogeneous Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal shape: Doping is an effective way to control crystal shape in mineralization processes. Studying the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline hexagonal platelets of Co&#8208;doped ZnO with advanced high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques can hereby provide an instructive insight into the details of the formation mechanism.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;doped zinc oxide single crystals with the shape of hexagonal platelets were synthesized by thermohydrolysis of zinc acetate, cobalt acetate, and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) in mixtures of ethanol and water. The mineralization proceeds by a low&#8208;temperature dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation process from the liquid phase by the formation of basic cobalt zinc salts as intermediates. The crystal shape as well as twin formation of the resulting oxide phase can be influenced by careful choice of the solvent mixture and the amount of doping. An understanding of the course of the reaction was achieved by comprehensive employment of analytical techniques (i.e., SEM, XRD, IR) including an in&#8208;depth HRTEM study of precipitates from various reaction stages. In addition, EPR as well as UV/Vis spectroscopic measurements provide information about the insertion of the cobalt dopant into the zincite lattice. The Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique is shown to be suitable for depositing coatings of the platelets on glass substrates functionalized with polyelectrolyte multilayers and hence is applied for the formation of monolayers containing domains with ordered tessellation. No major differences are found between deposits on substrates with anionic or cationic surface modification. The adherence to the substrates is sufficient to determine the absolute orientation of the deposited polar single crystals by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) studies.

      <title>Pyrrolic and Dipyrrolic Chlorophyll Degradation Products in Plants and Herbivores</title>
      <dc:description>
On its degradation: Evidence for a further pathway of chlorophyll degradation was found in plants and herbivores. Mono&#8208; and dipyrrolic compounds, known from heme degradation, were detected and quantified in leaves, spit and feces of herbivores. Novel natural products were detected and the structure of one, dihydro BOX A, was proven by synthesis.







Abstract
The degradation of chlorophyll, the omnipresent green pigment, has been investigated intensively over the last 30&#8197;years resulting in many elucidated tetrapyrrolic degradation products. With a comparison to the degradation of the structurally similar heme, we hereby propose a novel additional chlorophyll degradation mechanism to mono&#8208; and dipyrrolic products. This is the first proof of the occurrence of a family of mono&#8208; and dipyrrols in leaves that are previously only known as heme degradation products. This product family is also found in spit and feces of herbivores with specific metabolomic patterns reflecting the origin of the samples. Based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric evidence as well as on mechanistic considerations we also suggest several tentative new degradation products. One of them, dihydro BOX&#8197;A, was fully confirmed as a novel natural product by synthesis and comparison of its spectroscopic data.

      <title>Further Evidence for &#8216;Extended&#8217; Cumulene Complexes: Derivatives from Reactions with Halide Anions and Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Reactions of 4&#8208;ethynyl metal phenyl&#8208; or thienyl&#8208;acetylide complexes with electrophiles produce reaction products consistent with the formation of quinoidal and thienyl cumulenes.







Abstract
Reactions of [Ru{C=C(H)&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4C&#8801;CH}(PPh3)2Cp]BF4 ([1&#8201;a]BF4) with hydrohalic acids, HX, results in the formation of [Ru{C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C(X)=CH2}(PPh3)2Cp] [X=Cl (2&#8201;a&#8208;Cl), Br (2&#8201;a&#8208;Br)], arising from facile Markovnikov addition of halide anions to the putative quinoidal cumulene cation [Ru(=C=C=C6H4=C=CH2)(PPh3)2Cp]+. Similarly, [M{C=C(H)&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH}(LL)Cp ]BF4 [M(LL)Cp&#8217;=Ru(PPh3)2Cp ([1&#8201;a]BF4); Ru(dppe)Cp* ([1&#8201;b]BF4); Fe(dppe)Cp ([1&#8201;c]BF4); Fe(dppe)Cp* ([1&#8201;d]BF4)] react with H+/H2O to give the acyl&#8208;functionalised phenylacetylide complexes [M{C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C(=O)CH3}(LL)Cp&#8217;] (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) after workup. The Markovnikov addition of the nucleophile to the remote alkyne in the cations [1&#8201;a&#8211;d]+ is difficult to rationalise from the vinylidene form of the precursor and is much more satisfactorily explained from initial isomerisation to the quinoidal cumulene complexes [M(=C=C=C6H4=C=CH2)(LL)Cp&#8217;]+ prior to attack at the more exposed, remote quaternary carbon. Thus, whilst representative acetylide complexes [Ru(C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH)(PPh3)2Cp] (4&#8201;a) and [Ru(C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH)(dppe)Cp*] (4&#8201;b) reacted with the relatively small electrophiles [CN]+ and [C7H7]+ at the &#946;&#8208;carbon to give the expected vinylidene complexes, the bulky trityl ([CPh3]+) electrophile reacted with [M(C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C&#8801;CH)(LL)Cp&#8217;] [M(LL)Cp&#8217;=Ru(PPh3)2Cp (4&#8201;a); Ru(dppe)Cp* (4&#8201;b); Fe(dppe)Cp (4&#8201;c); Fe(dppe)Cp* (4&#8201;d)] at the more exposed remote end of the carbon&#8208;rich ligand to give the putative quinoidal cumulene complexes [M{C=C=C6H4=C=C(H)CPh3}(LL)Cp&#8217;]+, which were isolated as the water adducts [M{C&#8801;C&#8208;1,4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C(=O)CH2CPh3}(LL)Cp&#8217;] (6&#8201;a&#8211;d).

      <title>Dirhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Azidation of Benzaldehydes</title>
      <dc:description>
Double up: An efficient azidation method mediated by dirhodium(II) catalysts to achieve the direct aryl azidation of aromatic aldehydes is developed which avoids the use of protected aldehydes and prefunctionalized arenes. The mechanism studies indicate that the one&#8208;electron oxidative intermediate Rh2(II,III)N3 is responsible for the azide transfer. The regioselectivity of this method is similar to those of typical aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Multiple steps are needed to achieve the C&#8722;H functional of aromatic aldehyde, since the C&#8722;H functional reaction usually occurs preferentially at the aldehydic C&#8722;H bond over the aryl C&#8722;H bond. We report an efficient azidation method mediated by dirhodium(II) catalysts to achieve the direct aryl azidation of aromatic aldehydes avoiding the simultaneous use of protected aldehydes and prefunctionalized arenes. The regioselectivity of this method is similar to those of typical aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions. The resulting azidobenzaldehyde products are versatile building blocks or precursors for the synthesis of many biologically active compounds. The mechanism studies indicate that the one&#8208;electron oxidative intermediate Rh2(II,III)N3 is responsible for the azide transfer.

      <title>Cystobactamid 507: Concise Synthesis, Mode of Action, and Optimization toward More Potent Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Optimized cystobactamid antibiotics: MedChem optimization of the antibiotic cystobactamid 507 targeting DNA gyrase resulted in the construction of analogues with improved activity. Bioactive conformation was disclosed and the shortest synthetic route established. Mode of action studies revealed specific binding at the DNA minor groove. Incorporation of a tripeptidic cystobactamid 507 analogue into a hexapeptide resulted in superior activity.







Abstract
Lack of new antibiotics and increasing antimicrobial resistance are among the main concerns of healthcare communities nowadays, and these concerns necessitate the search for novel antibacterial agents. Recently, we discovered the cystobactamids&#8212;a novel natural class of antibiotics with broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. In this work, we describe 1)&#8197;a concise total synthesis of cystobactamid 507, 2)&#8197;the identification of the bioactive conformation using noncovalently bonded rigid analogues, and 3)&#8197;the first structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study for cystobactamid 507 leading to new analogues with high metabolic stability, superior topoisomerase IIA inhibition, antibacterial activity and, importantly, stability toward the resistant factor AlbD. Deeper insight into the mode of action revealed that the cystobactamids employ DNA minor&#8208;groove binding as part of the drug&#8211;target interaction without showing significant intercalation. By designing a new analogue of cystobactamid 919&#8208;2, we finally demonstrated that these findings could be further exploited to obtain more potent hexapeptides against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

     alt="Cystobactamid 507: Concise Synthesis, Mode of Action, and Optimization toward More Potent Antibiotics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optimized cystobactamid antibiotics&lt;/b&gt;: MedChem optimization of the antibiotic cystobactamid 507 targeting DNA gyrase resulted in the construction of analogues with improved activity. Bioactive conformation was disclosed and the shortest synthetic route established. Mode of action studies revealed specific binding at the DNA minor groove. Incorporation of a tripeptidic cystobactamid 507 analogue into a hexapeptide resulted in superior activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of new antibiotics and increasing antimicrobial resistance are among the main concerns of healthcare communities nowadays, and these concerns necessitate the search for novel antibacterial agents. Recently, we discovered the cystobactamids&#8212;a novel natural class of antibiotics with broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. In this work, we describe 1)&#8197;a concise total synthesis of cystobactamid 507, 2)&#8197;the identification of the bioactive conformation using noncovalently bonded rigid analogues, and 3)&#8197;the first structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study for cystobactamid 507 leading to new analogues with high metabolic stability, superior topoisomerase IIA inhibition, antibacterial activity and, importantly, stability toward the resistant factor AlbD. Deeper insight into the mode of action revealed that the cystobactamids employ DNA minor&#8208;groove binding as part of the drug&#8211;target interaction without showing significant intercalation. By designing a new analogue of cystobactamid 919&#8208;2, we finally demonstrated that these findings could be further exploited to obtain more potent hexapeptides against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Periodicity of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Behaviour of Heterotetranuclear Lanthanide Complexes across the Lanthanide Series: A Compendium</title>
      <dc:description>
Divergent trend: The dynamics of single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour modulated by heterometallic bonding interaction axial to the lanthanide (Ln) ion was investigated holistically in acetato&#8208;bridged tetranuclear Pd&#8211;Ln complexes for the whole lanthanide series by experimental and theoretical methods. A unique trend with divergence depending on whether the ion is Kramers or non&#8208;Kramers was observed across the series.







Abstract
Acetato&#8208;bridged palladium&#8211;lanthanide tetranuclear heterometallic complexes of the form [Pd2Ln2(H2O)2(CH3COO)10]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3COOH [Ln2=Ce2 (1), Pr2 (2), Nd2 (3), Sm2 (4), Tb2 (5), Dy2 (6), Dy0.2Y1.8 (6&#8242;&#8242;), Ho2 (7), Er2 (8), Er0.24Y1.7 (8&#8242;&#8242;), Tm2 (9), Yb2 (10), Y2(11)] were synthesised and characterised by experimental and theoretical techniques. All complexes containing Kramers lanthanide ions [Ln3+=Ce (1), Nd (3), Sm (4), Dy (6), DyY (6&#8242;&#8242;), Er (8), ErY (8&#8242;&#8242;), Yb (10)] showed field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation, characteristic of single&#8208;molecule magnetism and purely of molecular origin. In contrast, all non&#8208;Kramers lanthanide ions [Ln3+=Pr (2), Tb (5), Ho (7), Tm (9), Y3+ (11) is diamagnetic and non&#8208;lanthanide] did not show any slow magnetic relaxation. The variation in the electronic structure and accompanying consequences across the complexes representing all Kramers and non&#8208;Kramers lanthanide ions were investigated. The origin of the magnetic properties and the extent to which the axial donor&#8211;acceptor interaction involving the lanthanide ions and an electron&#8208;deficient 
 orbital of palladium affects the observed magnetic and electronic properties across the lanthanide series are presented. Unique consistent electronic and magnetic properties of isostructural complexes spanning the lanthanide series with properties dependent on whether the ions are Kramers or non&#8208;Kramers are reported.

      <title>Sr3P3N7: Complementary Approach by Ammonothermal and High&#8208;Pressure Syntheses</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitridophosphates: A complementary approach of medium&#8208; and high&#8208;pressure methods with their respective advantages was used for the synthesis of Sr3P3N7, indicating this strategy as promising for further investigation of novel nitridophosphates. Upon doping with Eu2+, Sr3P3N7 exhibits luminescence in the deep&#8208;red region.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates exhibit an intriguing structural diversity with different structural motifs, for example, chains, layers or frameworks. In this contribution the novel nitridophosphate Sr3P3N7 with unprecedented dreier double chains is presented. Crystalline powders were synthesized using the ammonothermal method, while single crystals were obtained by a high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure of Sr3P3N7 was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray methods. Sr3P3N7 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P2/c. Energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy were conducted to confirm the chemical composition, as well as the absence of NHx functionality. The optical band gap was estimated to be 4.4&#8197;eV using diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy. Upon doping with Eu2+, Sr3P3N7 shows a broad deep&#8208;red to infrared emission (&#955;em=681&#8197;nm, fwhm&#8776;3402&#8197;cm&#8722;1) with an internal quantum efficiency of 42&#8201;%.

      <dc:description>
Seeking suitable structures: The P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxides (NaxTMO2, TM=transition&#8208;metal element), as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Herein, structural evolution, anionic redox reactions, some challenges, and recent progress of the application of NaxTMO2 cathodes for SIBs are reviewed and summarized.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted much attention due to their abundance, easy accessibility, and low cost. All of these advantages make them potential candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. The P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxides (NaxTMO2; TM=Mn, Co, Ni, Ti, Fe, V, Cr, and a mixture of multiple elements) exhibit good Na+ ion conductivity and structural stability, which make them an excellent choice for the cathode materials of SIBs. Herein, the structural evolution, anionic redox reaction, some challenges, and recent progress of NaxTMO2 cathodes for SIBs are reviewed and summarized. Moreover, a detailed understanding of the relationship of chemical components, structures, phase compositions, and electrochemical performance is presented. This Review aims to provide a reference for the development of P2&#8208;type layered transition&#8208;metal oxide cathode materials for SIBs.

      <title>Facile Access to Dative, Single, and Double Silicon&#8722;Metal Bonds Through M&#8722;Cl Insertion Reactions of Base&#8208;Stabilized SiII Cations</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile access route to Si&#8594;M, Si&#8722;M, and Si=M (M=Ru, Rh) moieties through the insertion of NHC&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions into metal&#8722;chloride bonds and subsequent reductive dehalogenation is reported. The coordination&#8211;insertion&#8211;migration mechanism was investigated theoretically and verified experimentally through NMR and XRD characterization of the intermediate silyliumylidene transition&#8208;metal coordination complexes.







Abstract
Silicon(II) cations can offer fascinating reactivity patterns due to their unique electronic structure: a lone pair of electrons, two empty p orbitals and a positive charge combined on a single silicon center. We now report the facile insertion of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions into M&#8722;Cl bonds (M=Ru, Rh), forming a series of novel chlorosilylene transition&#8208;metal complexes. Theoretical investigations revealed a reaction mechanism in which the insertion into the M&#8722;Cl bond with concomitant 1,2&#8208;migration of a silicon&#8208;bound NHC to the transition metal takes place after formation of an initial silyliumylidene transition&#8208;metal complex. The mechanism could be verified experimentally through characterization of the intermediate complexes. Furthermore, the obtained chlorosilylene complexes can be conveniently utilized as synthons to access Si&#8722;M and Si=M bonding motifs bonds through reductive dehalogenation.

      <title>Organogermanium(II) Hydrides as a Source of Highly Soluble LiH</title>
      <dc:description>
Soluble lithium hydride source: The reduction of C=Y polar bonds by RLi in the presence of monomeric germanium hydride is possible. The combination of PhLi with L(H)Ge&#8901;BH3 yielded (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 (3), which acts as a source of LiH for the reduction of benzaldehyde in non&#8208;polar solvents. The reaction proceeds via intermediate 3INT accompanied by the elimination of neutral complex L(Ph)Ge&#8901;BH3 (6).







Abstract
The reactions of monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#8901;BH3 with organolithium salts RLi yielded lithium hydrogermanatoborates (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GeR]})2. Compound (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 was used as a source of LiH for the reduction of organic C=O or C=N bonds in nonpolar solvents accompanied by the elimination of a neutral complex L(Ph)Ge&#8901;BH3. The interaction of (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 with the polar C=O bond was further investigated by computational studies revealing a plausible geometry of a pre&#8208;reactive intermediate. The experimental and theoretical studies suggest that, although the Li atom of (Li(THF)2{BH3[L(H)GePh]})2 coordinates the C=O bond, the GeH fragment is the active species in the reduction reaction. Finally, benzaldehyde was reduced by a mixture of L(H)Ge&#8901;BH3 with PhLi in nonpolar solvents.
