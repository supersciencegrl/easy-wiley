         <title>Widening the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of aqueous biphasic systems by changing the ionic liquid cation basicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate the formation of new stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus, therefore allowing the design of more sustainable separation processes. This dual behavior is achieved with ABS formed by mono or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity. While ABS comprising monocationic ionic liquids only respond to the effect of temperature, systems comprising dicationic ionic liquids are simultaneously affected by both temperature and pH variations. Dicationic ionic liquids are here identified as the key to unlock a double response to stimuli, which is due to the presence of two pKa values afforded by the cation. The reported findings contribute to increase the customizability of double stimuli&#8208;responsive ABS based on ionic liquids, whose development was up to date limited to ionic liquids bearing pH&#8208;responsive anions, opening the door towards the development of more sustainable separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81 V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310 mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9 mW cm&#8208;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Artificial Laccase Catalysts by Introducing Substrate Oxidation Metals into Oxygen&#8208;Reducing Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laccase, a multi&#8208;copper oxidase, is limited by its optimal temperature range and isolation costs. To overcome these challenges, we synthesized copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67) with 16 mol% Cu as an artificial laccase catalyst. The introduced Cu site acts as the phenol oxidation site, and Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 is the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction site. Laccase also employs this division of oxidation and reduction sites. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 demonstrated significant catalytic activity, superior to natural laccase, especially at elevated temperatures, and maintained stability across multiple reaction cycles. These findings suggest that Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 is a robust, reusable alternative for industrial applications requiring high thermal stability and efficient catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted and Untargeted Amine Metabolite Quantitation in Single Cells with Isobaric Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a single cell amine analysis approach utilizing isobarically multiplexed samples of 6 individual cells along with analyte abundant carrier. This methodology was applied for absolute quantitation of amino acids and untargeted relative quantitation of amines in a total of 108 individual cells using nanoflow LC with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Together with individually determined cell sizes, this provides quantification of intracellular&#160;concentrations within individual cells. The targeted method was partially validated for 10 amino acids with limits of detection in low attomoles, linear calibration range covering analyte amounts typically from 30 amol to 120 fmol, and correlation coefficients (R) above 0.99. This was applied with cell sizes recorded during dispensing to determine millimolar intracellular amino acid concentrations. The untargeted approach yielded 249 features that were detected in at least 25% of the single cells, providing modest cell type separation on principal component analysis. Using Greedy forward selection with regularized least squares, a sub&#8208;selection of 100 features explaining most of the difference was determined. These features were annotated using MS2 from analyte standards and accurate mass with library search. The approach provides accessible, sensitive, and high&#8208;throughput method with the potential to be expanded also to other forms of ultrasensitive analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO4 electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn2+ ion distribution and alleviate H2O&#8208;involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA&#8208;modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170 h to 1092 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2/1 mAh cm&#8208;2. The reversibility improvement of Zn anode also benefits the cycling durability of full devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Zn||I&#8322; batteries assembled in as&#8208;designed electrolyte witness only 11.3% capacity decay over 17000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, far outstripping that observed in ZnSO4 counterpart (~ 4675 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs): Design and Synthesis of Two New Cavity&#8208;Chalcopyrite Chalcogenides Based on "Iterative Substitution" Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an "iterative substitution" strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. Benefiting from the substitution of Fe3+ cations by Ga3+ cations, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40 eV, respectively, which is about five times higher than their structure template CuFeS2, and the large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8 &#215; AgGaS2). Combining theoretical calculation and structural analysis confirm that the [GaS4] tetrahedra make the main contribution on their good liner and nonlinear optical (NLO) performances. The "iterative substitution" strategy expands the design idea of materials and can lead to the discovery of a large number of IR NLO compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic seawater splitting by Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts: metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials made of plasmonic magnesium diboride and transitional metal dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their excellent light harvesting in a broad spectral range as well as efficient charge carrier generation and transfer. In majority of such metamaterials, semiconductors are used to initiate the water splitting reaction, while their metal counterparts are employed to improve light harvesting through plasmonic effects. Here, we describe for the first time an exceptional reversed case of metal&#8208;semiconductor photocatalysts in which metals are used to initiate the water splitting reaction and semiconductors are employed to improve light harvesting through blackbody effect and serve as co&#8208;catalysts. The studied photoanodes are made of non&#8208;noble plasmonic MgB2 combined with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The plasmonic resonances of the MgB2 component contribute to field confinement, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, and hot&#8208;electron transfer providing an enhancement of photoactivity in the entire solar spectrum capable of water splitting. The TMDC component provides impedance matching and enhances light absorption by the metal catalyst. We demonstrate seawater splitting with MgB2&#8208;TMDCs photoanodes attaining current densities of ~ 3 mA&#8901;cm&#8208;2 at solar radiation. The overall efficiency of hydrogen production in seawater splitting by sunlight with the help of the studied photoanodes is 3% at bias voltage of Vbias = 0.3 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Cu (I) Complexes for Intracellular Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has heralded a new era of chemical biology and biomedicine. However, caveats of CuAAC include formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other copper&#8208;related toxicity. This limits utility in sensitive biological samples and matrices. Towards addressing these caveats, we synthesized and fully characterized two air and water stable trinuclear Cu (I) dimer complexes. The complexes were stable to oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, acid, base, and other chelators, which was reasoned to be due to the linear benzimidazole&#8208;Cu&#8208;benzimidazole geometry. Computational investigations of the catalytic cycle implicated two of the three coppers in the trimer complex as the active metal centers. The complexes were shown to catalyze the reaction at far below sub&#8208;toxic concentrations for intracellular click reactions to label triple negative breast cancer cells and compared to the current CuSO&#173;4&#8208;THPTA standard.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptation of the BaAl4 Type to Small Cations: The Case of NaGa4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of NaGa4 presents a branch of the BaAl4 type characterized by an unusually large c/a ratio. This distortion allows the BaAl4 type to accommodate small cations, providing an alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in the CaGa4 type.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase NaGa4 samples were prepared by annealing stoichiometric element mixtures at 200&#8201;&#176;C, 300&#8201;&#176;C, and 450&#8201;&#176;C in closed tantalum ampoules. No compositional homogeneity range was detected. While single crystals annealed at 200&#8201;&#176;C feature a fully ordered crystal structure, a crystal annealed at 300&#8201;&#176;C reveals a defect with mutual exchange of Na atoms and Ga2 dumbbells. The structure motif caused by the violation of translational symmetry resembles the CeMg2Si2 type of structure. The NaGa4 structure constitutes a branch of the BaAl4 type distinguished by a notably high c/a ratio (space group I4/mmm; a=4.2261(1) &#197;, c=11.2633(6) &#197;, c/a=2.67). This distortion enables the adaption of the BaAl4&#8208;type to small cations, when the further shortening of the apical&#8211;apical distance d(Ga&#8211;Ga) is not possible any more. Therefore, NaGa4 offers an adaption alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in CaGa4 and YbGa4. Conductivity measurements validate the metallic behavior anticipated by NMR measurements in earlier studies.

         <title>Networked Multicomponent Ensemble as AND Gate with FRET Output</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A networked supramolecular logic AND gate system is accomplished using precise chemical communication within a multicomponent ensemble via metal ion&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting processes. The cybernetic AND gate is composed of a copper(I)&#8208;loaded nanoswitch, an aza&#8208;crown ether and a rhodamine receptor. The modus operandi of the AND gate, from state (0,0), was induced with stoichiometric amounts of two inputs (IN&#8208;1&#160;= Hg2+,&#160;IN&#8208;2&#160;= Li+) generating copper(I) ions as output only in state (1,1). Generation of state (1,1) from state (0,0) involves selective Cu+&#160;ion translocation from the nanoswitch to the aza&#8208;crown ether in the first step (IN&#8208;1) and then from the aza&#8208;crown ether to the rhodamine receptor in the second step (IN&#8208;2). The released copper(I) output acts as a messenger that binds to the rhodamine receptor, triggering it's spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening, which leads to a diagnostic FRET emission from the copper(I)&#8208;loaded Rhodamine scaffold accompanied by a remarkable fluorescence and colour change from pale yellow to pink.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of a Peroxide Bond via a Dual Attack by Functional&#160;Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxins, control cellular redox levels by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of GPx enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate/thiolate molecule is probably due to the dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond (HO1&#8208;O2H) by the enzyme; The first one is a nucleophilic attack of the selenolate/thiolate moiety to O1 atom and the second attack at the O2 atom of the peroxide bond by the acidic &#8220;parked proton&#8221; from Trp or His residue present at the enzyme&#8217;s active site, leading to the facile cleavage of O&#8208;O bond. Herein, we report two synthetic compounds (1 and 2), having a selenolate (Se&#8722;) and a proton donor (imidazolium or &#8211;COOH group) moieties, which showed excellent GPx&#8208;like activity via dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond. The combined effect of selenolate moiety that donates electrons to the antibonding&#160;orbital of O1&#8208;O2 bond and the imidazolium or carboxylic acid moiety at the side chain that forms a strong H&#8208;bonding with the O2 atom facilitates O&#8208;O bond cleavage of H2O2 more efficiently. 1 and 2 exhibit remarkable ability in protecting Cu(I)&#8208;complex [TpmCu(CH3CN)]+ (9) against H2O2 by acting as a sacrificial antioxidant, thereby preventing metal&#8208;mediated ROS production.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating solvated sheath with anion chelant enables 4.6 V ultra&#8208;stable commercial LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing cut&#8208;off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&gt; 4.6 V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high&#8208;voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB&#8208;PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well&#8208;designed electrolyte composed of 1 mol L&#8208;1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4 Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing cut-off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&amp;gt; 4.6 V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high-voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB-PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF-rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well-designed electrolyte composed of 1 mol L-1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4 Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high-voltage LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Ethynyl Substituted Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 6,13&#8208;bis(triisopropylsilyl)pentacene (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively attacked the unsubstituted off&#8208;center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between the silylethynyl substituents to react at the central ring. Epoxynaphthalene adducts of 1 as well as its anthracene and tetracene congeners were deoxygenated, easily furnishing triarenobarrelenes with TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituents at the bridge heads, attractive building blocks for porous solids and higher acene&#8208;based trimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective H/D Exchange Based on Reversible C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the increasing use of copper in C&#8208;H functionalizations, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed direct deuteration of C&#8208;H bonds remains a significant challenge due to its inherent low reactivity in inverse C&#8208;H bond reconstruction. In this paper, a novel strategy had been developed to reverse the copper&#8208;catalyzed concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation process by inhibiting the unexpected disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III). Picolinic acid was identified as a powerful ligand for facilitating this H/D exchange with D2O as deuterium source, and its inhibition activity was supported by preliminary control experiments and DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds via Alkyne Benzannulation on Zigzag&#8208;Edged Dibenzochrysene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes are interesting building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors as they possess synthetic handles that can be used to functionalize them and, consequently, change their electronic properties. However, reactions to extend their &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework through ring annulation have only been scarcely tested. Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene (vat orange 3) and 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene (vat orange 1) to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. More surprisingly, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds. Absorption spectroscopy reveals that ring annulation on both 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene and 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene resulted in a decrease of 0.38 and 0.12 eV in bandgap values, respectively, despite inducing a contorted conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication is applied to aqueous Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle&#8208;based bromine removal and upgraded applications, including silver recovery, MnO2&#8208;involved closed&#8208;loop material cycling, and battery electrode modification. With the benign and scalable acoustic boost, the efficiency of bromine fixation and related post&#8208;applications are significantly improved. The processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.







Abstract
Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymer Hosts&#8208;Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of polymer, macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules brings infinite vitality to the construction of luminescent materials for bioimaging. Herein, we proposed discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts for assembling AIE molecules to induce cascade luminescence enhancement in water and to achieve desirable bioimaging performance via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units, the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules.







Abstract
The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.

Recent advances in photo&#8208;/electocatalyzed alkene difunctionalization enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization are summarized, which are divided to four sections based on the final terminating step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling, along with selected impressive synthetic examples to showcase the importance of the C&#8722;H radical functionalization&#8208;enabled alkene difunctionalization in synthesis.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling.

         <title>Non&#8208;Medical Applications of Inorganic Medicines. A Switch Based on Mechanistic Knowledge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the description of integrated approaches for unveiling the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs, through selected examples, it is highlighted how the obtained mechanistic information may turn relevant for the application of inorganic drugs in fields different from medicine.







Abstract
Metals have been used in medicine for centuries. However, it was not until much later that the effects of inorganic drugs could be rationalized from a mechanistic point of view. Today, thanks to the technologies available, this approach has been functionally developed and implemented. It has been found that there is probably no single biological target for the pharmacological effects of most inorganic drugs. Herein, we present an overview of some integrated and multi&#8208;technique approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs. On this premise, selected examples are used to illustrate how the information obtained on metal&#8208;based drugs and their respective mechanisms can become relevant for applications in fields other than medicine. For example, some well&#8208;known metallodrugs, which have been shown to bind specific amino acid residues of proteins, can be used to solve problems related to protein structure elucidation in crystallographic studies. Diruthenium tetraacetate can be used to catalyze the conversion of hydroxylamines to nitrones with a high selectivity when bound to lysozyme. Finally, a case study is presented in which an unprecedented palladium/arsenic&#8208;mediated catalytic cycle for nitrile hydration was discovered thanks to previous studies on the solution chemistry of the anticancer compound arsenoplatin&#8208;1 (AP&#8208;1).

         <title>Neutral Adducts of Molybdenum Hexafluoride: Structure and Bonding in MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum hexafluoride was shown to form Lewis acid base adduct with the organic base pyridine, the first neutral transition metal adducts beyond those of WF6. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic geometries. The trigonal prismatic MoF6 moiety in the adducts can be explained by the high electrostatic potentials of the square faces, where pyridine can coordinate.







Abstract
The first Lewis acid base adducts of MoF6 and an organic base have been synthesized, i.&#8201;e., MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2. These adducts are structurally characterized with X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing that both adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic structures. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts are fluxional on the NMR time scale at room temperature. Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by 19F NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct, MoF6(NC5H5)2, whereas MoF6(NC5H5) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra. Natural Bond Order and Molecular Electrostatic Potential analyses elucidate the structures and properties of the MoF6 pyridine adducts. Regions of significantly higher molecular electrostatic potential, i.&#8201;e., &#963;&#8208;holes, in trigonal prismatic compared to octahedral MoF6 rationalize the capped trigonal prismatic geometry of the adducts. Whereas MoF6(NC5H5) is stable at room temperature under exclusion of moisture, MoF6(NC5H5)2 decomposes at 60&#8201;&#176;C in pyridine solvent, and the solid slowly decomposes at room temperature after 24&#8197;h.

         <title>Cyanide Linkage Isomerization Induced by Cobalt Oxidation&#8208;State Changes at a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue/ZnO Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VSFG spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry reveals critical interplay between interfacial oxidation and cyanide flip in Co&#8722;Fe Prussian Blue/ZnO heterostructure. Tuning the fabrication temperature for such heterostructure gives access to an easily accessible approach for controlling interfacial composition. This work shows that co&#8208;operativity at the molecular level facilitate kinetically demanding chemical processes at such interfaces.







Abstract
Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro&#8208;electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII&#8594;CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co&#8722;NC&#8722;Fe coordination mode to a Co&#8722;CN&#8722;Fe one. Photoluminescence measurements and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface.

         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking nano&#8208;photosensitizer: a core&#8208;shell merocyanine&#8208;azobenzene on gold nanoparticles. This cutting&#8208;edge technology demonstrates remarkable efficacy in generating singlet oxygen. With its long&#8208;lasting stability and enhanced biocompatibility, it holds immense potential for advancing phototherapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8722;N&#8722;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47&#8197;minutes to over 154&#8197;hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core-shell azobenzene-spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano-photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8722;N&#8722;C bond recombination dynamics via in-situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in-situ formation of merocyanine and a light-induced compact shell arrangement extend its half-life from 47&#8197;minutes to over 154&#8197;hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano-photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long-lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent identity influences the rate and site&#8208;selectivity of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 in several ways. Substrates with H&#8208;bond donating groups are deactivated in polar solvents with high solvent hydrogen bonding basicity, whereas electron deficient substrates and aryl triflates undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents.







Abstract
We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen bonding between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8722;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8722;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8722;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridyl halides.

Indolizines are important N&#8208;fused heterocycles which exist widely in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic optoelectronic materials. In this communication, A base promoted oxidative [4+2] annulation of pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde derivatives with o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines for the synthesis of highly substituted indolizines has been developed. Using DBN as base, a broad range of 5,6,7&#8208;trisubstituted indolizines have been prepared in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, and many useful functional groups can be tolerated.

         <title>Controlling (E/Z)&#8208;Stereoselectivity of &#8722;NHC=O Chlorination: Mechanism Principles for Wide Scope Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the increasing interest in halo compounds in chemotherapy and protein modification/targeting in chiral bioenvironments, controlling the halogenation stereoselectivity is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art science. Halogenation of carbamoyl group (&#8722;NHC=O) has never been mechanistically studied. Herein, we dive into depths of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, provide the first comprehensive mechanism highlighting the selectivity&#8208;limiting factors and provide subsequent inspirations to control the (E/Z)&#8208;stereochemical output and insights into multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
Organic halogen compounds are cornerstones of applied chemical sciences. Halogen substitution is a smart molecular design strategy adopted to influence reactivity, membrane permeability and receptor interaction. Chiral bioreceptors may restrict the stereochemical requirements in the halo&#8208;ligand design. Straightforward (but expensive) catalyzed stereospecific halogenation has been reported. Historically, PCl5 served access to uncatalyzed stereoselective chlorination although the stereochemical outcomes were influenced by steric parameters. Nonetheless, stereochemical investigation of PCl5 reaction mechanism with carbamoyl (RCONHX) compounds has never been addressed. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive stereochemical mechanistic explanation outlining halogenation of carbamoyl compounds with PCl5; the key regioselectivity&#8208;limiting nitrilimine intermediate (8&#8208;Z.HCl); how substitution pattern influences regioselectivity; why oxadiazole byproduct (P1) is encountered; stereo&#8208;electronic factors influencing the hydrazonoyl chloride (P2) production; and discovery of two stereoselectivity&#8208;limiting parallel mechanisms (stepwise and concerted) of elimination of HCl and POCl3. DFT calculations, synthetic methodology optimization, X&#8208;ray evidence and experimental reaction kinetics study evidence all supported the suggested mechanism proposal (Scheme&#8197;2). Finally, we provide mechanism&#8208;inspired future recommendations for directing the reaction stereoselectivity toward elusive and stereochemically inaccessible (E)&#8208;bis&#8208;hydrazonoyl chlorides along with potentially pivotal applications of both (E/Z)&#8208;stereoisomers especially in medicinal chemistry and protein modification.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear Ag(I) ferrocenyl dithiophosphonates with various alkyl chains were characterized, and fluorescence emission at RT was detected for the first time with effective quantum yields. The HER activity reveals the impact of metallic nuclearity and peripheral ligand engineering. The electrolytic results with the proposed mechanism were supported by the DFT study and established a link between molecular structures and their physical and HER catalytic properties, advancing the field of renewable energy resources.







Abstract
The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R=Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc=Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4) (&#627;5&#8208;C5H5)} and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R=Et (2&#8201;a), and nPr (3&#8201;a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8211;5 and 2&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a showed effective current density of 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991&#8197;mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8722;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2&#8201;a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33&#8201;% to 67&#8201;%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.

The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; showed effective current density of 1&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991&#8197;mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono-/di&#8722;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra-nuclear [Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PFc(O&lt;sup&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*-SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and di-nuclear (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33&#8201;% to 67&#8201;%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Toxicity Antimicrobial Polycarbonates Bearing Lysine Residues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial polycarbonates bearing natural amino acid residues are easy to synthesize and scale up cost&#8208;efficiently. Together with their good biocompatibility, these polymers show great potential as a new class of antibacterial biomaterials to treat bacterial infections and combat emerging antibiotic resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has been threatening public health for a long period, while the COVID pandemic aggravated the scenario. To combat antibiotic resistance strains, host defense peptides (HDPs) mimicking molecules have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported a series of polycarbonates bearing cationic lysine amino acid residues that could mimic the mechanism of action of HDPs and possess broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity. Moreover, those polymers had negligible toxicity toward red blood cells and mammalian cells. The membrane&#8208;disruption mechanism endows the lysine&#8208;containing polycarbonates with low possibility of resistance development and the fast killing kinetics, making them promising candidates for antimicrobial development.

         <title>Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atoms in a molecule are conceptual open quantum systems that exchange information. Quantifying that information allows for the characterization of such quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment.







Abstract
Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many&#8208;electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the condensed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum information patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum information theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted de Mayo Type Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first de Mayo&#8208;type reaction of bicyclobutanes has been successfully achieved via triplet energy transfer photocatalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;]&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol cascade, culminating in syn&#8208;specific difunctionalization butanes.







Abstract
We reported herein a visible light mediated de Mayo&#8208;type reaction between 1,3&#8208;diketones and BCB. The reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition and retro&#8208;aldol sequence, producing cis&#8208;difunctionalized cyclobutanes in high yields with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Double Chalcogen Bonding Recognition Arrays in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focused on the dimerization of newly synthetized Pyrselen derivatives, being evaluated both at the solid state (by XRD analysis) and in solution, by 77Se NMR dilution experiments carried out in CDCl3 at 298&#8197;K. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly at the liquid state is persistently observed in different solvents, highlighting the charge&#8208;transfer contribution of this interaction.







Abstract
N&#8208;substituted pyridino&#8208;based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and the solid state through a dual donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 5&#8211;50&#8197;M&#8722;1 range. Computational studies on the dimers depict a notable charge&#8208;transfer contribution to the association, validating Pyrselen as an effective scaffold for designing chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based recognition motifs.

         <dc:description>
Three heterometallic&#8208;organic cages with customized size and cavity have been precisely constructed using bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. First, three Ru2+&#8208;connected dendritic ligands were synthesized from initial tripodal building blocks. Then, further self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic ligands with Fe2+ quantitatively generate the desired tetrahedral cages, respectively.







Abstract
Accurately synthesizing coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic cages with customized shape and cavity remains a great challenge for chemists. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach was put forward. Employing this strategy, three terpyridyl heterometallic&#8208;organic truncated tetrahedral cages with different sizes and cavity were precisely synthesized. Firstly, the coordination of tripodal organic ligands with Ru2+ afforded dendritic metal&#8208;organic ligands L1&#8208;L3. Then the Ru building blocks complexed with Fe2+ and shrunk to form the desired heterometallic&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;C3). These discrete heterometallic&#8208;organic supramolecular cages were fully characterized and displayed the large and open cavities varied from 7205&#8197;&#197;3 to 9384&#8197;&#197;3. Notably, these cages could not be directly constructed by single&#8208;step assembly process using initial organic ligands or dimeric metal&#8208;organic ligands, indicative of the irreplaceability of a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise assembly strategy for size&#8208;customized architectures. This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal&#8208;organic cages with well&#8208;defined cavities.

         <title>Fast and Efficient Sensing of Drugs in Water Using Self&#8208;Assembling D&#8208;Glucamine&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenediimide and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide Fluorophores</title>

We employed two self&#8208;assembling fluorophores functionalized with D&#8208;Glucamine, as fluorescent sensors for emerging pollutants in water, such as drugs, belonging to different classes and differing significantly in structure.







Abstract
Fast and sensitive quantification of drugs as emerging pollutants in water bodies is a pressing need in contemporary society, to prevent serious environmental concerns that could negatively impact on human health. This explains the surge of interest in this field, and the need to identify highly selective sensing systems. Addressing this issue, in this work we synthesized two D&#8208;glucamine functionalized fluorophores bearing self&#8208;assembling cores, as 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and naphthalene diimide. We studied their self&#8208;assembly in water solution, and characterized the aggregated formed by determining their stability constant, their morphology and size by scanning electron microscopy, resonance light scattering and dynamic light scattering, as well their solid&#8208;state emission ability. Then, we studied their sensing ability, in water, towards pharmaceutically active compounds such as ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac sodium salt, by fluorescence investigation. Data collected show that the self&#8208;assembling ability is significantly affected by the fluorophore structure, which in turn also determines sensing ability. In particular, the naphtalene diimide&#8208;based probe was the most sensitive, with LOD as low as 0.01&#8197;&#956;M in the presence of nalidixic acid, which is in line and competitive with more complex sensing systems, recently reported in the literature.

         <title>Access to Diverse Carbonyl Compounds by Catalyst&#8208;Free and Photoinduced Aerobic Cleavage of C=N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds has been developed using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This strategy features broad substrate scope and a series of carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and relative drug analogues were obtained. Moreover, the easy&#8208;operation and gram&#8208;scale synthesis indicates the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.

         <title>THz&#8208;EPR&#8208;based Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations for Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets With Bis&#8208;Chelate Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental basis for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships for tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets is derived from precise zero&#8208;field splitting energies directly obtained by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy. A large elongation increases the magnetization barrier, while twisting of the chelate planes increases rhombicity and thus promotes relaxation by undesired quantum tunneling processes.







Abstract
New cobalt(II)&#8208;based complexes with [N2O2] coordination formed by two bis&#8208;chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by a multi&#8208;technique approach. The complexes possess an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy (D&lt;0) and magnetic measurements show a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization. The spin&#8208;reversal barriers, i.&#8201;e., the splitting of the two lowest Kramers doublets (UZFS), have been measured by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy, which allows to distinguish the two crystallographically independent species present in one of the complexes. Based on these experimental UZFS energies together with those for related complexes reported in literature, it was possible to establish magneto&#8208;structural correlations. UZFS linearly depends on the elongation parameter &#1013;T of the (pseudo&#8208;)tetrahedral coordination, which is given by the ratio between the average obtuse and acute angles at the cobalt(II) ion, while UZFS was found to be virtually independent of the twist angle of the chelate planes. With increasing deviation from the orthogonality of the latter, the rhombicity (|E/D|) increases.

         <title>Eludicating Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Tunneling Kinetics in the Cope Rearrangement of Semibullvalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When heavy atom tunneling regime is attained, the free energy reaction profile tunnels below the potential energy profile due to the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics simulations are able to provide free energy and rate constants describing this phenomenon. Here we use the Cope's rearrangement of semibullvalene as prototypical reaction.







Abstract
In this work, we characterize the temperature dependence of kinetic properties in heavy atom tunneling reactions by means of molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) via Path Integral theory. To this end, we consider the prototypical Cope rearrangement of semibullvalene. The reaction was studied in the 25&#8211;300&#8197;K temperature range observing that the inclusion of NQEs modifies the temperature behavior of both free energy barriers and dynamical recrossing factors with respect to classical dynamics. Notably, while in classical simulations the activation free energy shows a very weak temperature dependence, it becomes strongly dependent on temperature when NQEs are included. This temperature behavior shows a transition from a regime where the quantum effects are limited and can mainly be traced back to zero point energy, to a low temperature regime where tunneling plays a dominant role. In this regime, the free energy curve tunnels below the potential energy barrier along the reaction coordinate, allowing much faster reaction rates. Finally, the temperature dependence of the rate constants obtained from molecular dynamics simulations was compared with available experimental data and with semi&#8208;classical transition state theory calculations, showing comparable behaviors and similar transition temperatures from thermal to (deep) tunneling regime.

A series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesized, and they were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8208;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are promising heterogeneous photocatalyst candidates owing to their excellent stability, conjugacy, and tunability. In this study, a series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesised and utilised as photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation reactions. The corresponding optoelectronic properties could be precisely regulated by the electronic effects of different substituents in the nanopore channels of the CTFs; these CTFs were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation in organic synthesis due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8211;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine. This strategy provides a new scaffold for the rational design of CTFs as efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Compounds Within Pyrene&#8208;Based Frameworks</title>

Using the predictable packing arrangement of guanidinium organosulfonate with a pyrene core a host of different small molecules can be encapsulated and their structures elucidated.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) is the preferred and most accurate technique for determining molecular structures. However, it can present challenges when dealing with specific small molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as many do not form quality crystals without coformers or can be unstable. In this study, we introduce tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR), a robust guanidinium&#8208;organosulfonate (GS) framework that efficiently encapsulates small molecules and APIs rich in functional groups. The hydrogen bonding frameworks formed by G4PYR display well&#8208;ordered structures with predictable pyrene&#8208;pyrene distances, making them ideally suited for targeting arene&#8208;based APIs with pendant groups. Successful encapsulation of various guests, including benzaldehyde, benzamide, and arenes containing multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors like uracil and thymine, was achieved. Furthermore, we successfully encapsulated important pharmaceutical and biologically relevant compounds, such as lidocaine, ropinirole, adenosine, thymidine, and others. Notably, we present a workflow for investigating host&#8208;guest complex formation using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high throughput experimentation.

         <title>Recent Advances in DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for In vivo MiRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli and internal stimuli to prevent nonspecific activation; and the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging and indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging.







Abstract
As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNA) is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in&#8197;vitro miRNA detection to in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in&#8197;vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Step Intermolecular Interaction Of Molecular Macroions With Multivalent Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular cluster U60 macroion exhibits a very different solution behavior depending on the valences of added counterions. When multivalent counterions are introduced, unlike monovalent counterions, there is an additional step for the macroion&#8208;counterion interaction. The two&#8208;step mechanism can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation) phase transitions observed in the macroionic aqueous systems.







Abstract
Macroion&#8208;counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)OH]60 (U60) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one&#8208;step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two&#8208;step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion&#8208;pairing between U60 and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong U60&#8208;U60 attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion&#8208;counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute U60 aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.

         <title>Dual, Photo&#8208;Responsive and Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the development of novel dual light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of the supramolecular scaffold and display low levels of operational fatigue upon cyclic treatments with light and oxidative/reductive conditions.







Abstract
We report on dual, light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate reversible and robust stimuli&#8208;induced behaviour. Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work paves the way towards the creation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive foldamers of increasing sophistication capable of demonstrating reversible and robust responses to multiple distinct stimuli.

         <title>Covalent Lysozyme Immobilization on Enzymatic Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEMPO&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanocrystals (TO&#8208;CNCs) are an excellent substrate for the covalent immobilization of lysozyme from chicken egg white. The bioconjugates are synthesized, isolated and characterized and are potential candidates as antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Nanostructured materials represent promising substrates for biocatalyst immobilization and activation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), accessible from waste and/or renewable sources, are sustainable and biodegradable, show high specific surface area for anchoring a high number of enzymatic units, and high thermal and mechanical stability. In this work, we present a holistic enzyme&#8208;based approach to functional antibacterial materials by bioconjugation between the lysozyme from chicken egg white and enzymatic cellulose nanocrystals. The neutral CNCs were prepared by endoglucanase hydrolysis from Avicel. We explore the covalent immobilization of lysozyme on enzymatic CNCs and on their TEMPO oxidized derivatives (TO&#8208;CNCs), comparing immobilization yields, material properties, and enzymatic activities. The materials were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the higher overall efficiency of the immobilization process carried out on TO&#8208;CNCs, based on the success of covalent bonding and on the stability of the isolated bioconjugates.

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are conducted to investigate the potential photosensitivity of spiro organoboron compounds. Geometric analysis reveals that the configuration of S1 determines the molecular ISC rate constants, and PSs with a (N, N) acceptor exhibit higher theoretical sensitization efficiency than those with a (N, O) acceptor, which is contributed by the donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal feature.







Abstract
Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8211;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8211;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8722;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes disrupt water molecule networks, inhibiting dendrite growth and improving zinc anode stability, while guiding uniform zinc deposition, significantly enhancing battery cycle life and Coulombic efficiency. This work underscores the potential of electrolyte additives to address critical limitations in zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5&#8201;%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear donor&#8208;Au&#8208;acceptor complexes with intramolecular aurophilic interactions were synthesized. The increased metal contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital enlarges S1&#8208;T1 energy gap, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Moreover, unexpected excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence was observed, attributed to the poor internal conversion originating from the large energy separation and spatially isolated orbital between various excited states.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224&#8197;&#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8211;0.52&#8197;eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
I'm still stacking! Partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulene macrocycles have been synthesized using a combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings and oxidative alkyne dimerizations. They stack into extended slipped columns despite their low symmetry which prevents full electronic self&#8208;complementarity. These stacking arrangements are mediated by slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions between fluorinated arene rings and fluoroarene&#8208;arene short contacts. Computations suggest that this assembly is dispersion&#8208;driven.







Abstract
Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a desymmetrized non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.

         <title>Twist along Central C&#8722;C Bonds in a Series of Fully &#960;&#8208;Fused Propellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist in a series of &#960;&#8208;fused propellanes is investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods. A biphenyl&#8208;fused [4.4.4]propellane gives D3&#8208;symmetric enantiomers stable at 146&#8201;&#176;C, whereas naphthalene&#8208;fused [3.3.3]propellane and [4.3.3]hybrid show non&#8208;twisted form and fast twist inversion at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C between (P/M)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The twist is correlated with large changes of NMR chemical shifts and other physical properties.







Abstract
Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8722;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane&#8208;like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146&#8201;&#176;C. By contrast, a hybrid [4.3.3]propellane exhibits fast interconversion between two twisted conformations even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;Twist in a series of &#960;-fused propellanes is investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods. A biphenyl-fused [4.4.4]propellane gives &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric enantiomers stable at 146&#8201;&#176;C, whereas naphthalene-fused [3.3.3]propellane and [4.3.3]hybrid show non-twisted form and fast twist inversion at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C between (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-conformations, respectively. The twist is correlated with large changes of NMR chemical shifts and other physical properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6-membered-ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8722;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane-like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6-membered-ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146&#8201;&#176;C. By contrast, a hybrid [4.3.3]propellane exhibits fast interconversion between two twisted conformations even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) comprising g&#8208;C3N4@ZnFe2O4, featuring tiny mesopores and effective heterojunctions, demonstrate superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and dye degradation under solar illumination, with recyclability and easy separation using magnets.







Abstract
Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4&#8197;nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50&#8197;m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20&#8201;%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147&#8197;min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Method for the Selective Synthesis of Amides and N&#8208;Acylureas from Carboxylic Acids and Thioureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a base and photocatalyst, thiourea undergoes deprotonation and a single&#8208;electron transfer process, subsequently leading to desulfurization and the formation of carbodiimide. Ultimately, the carboxylic acid reacts with carbodiimide, and can selectively produce amides and N&#8208;acylureas.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method for the selective synthesis of amides and N&#8208;acylureas from carboxylic acids and thioureas. This protocol was featured as avoidance of additional oxidants and transition metal catalysts, simple manipulations, low cost, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. As only oxygen serves as the oxidation reagent, this method provides a promising synthesis candidate for the formation of N&#8208;aryl amides and N&#8208;acylureas, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules and biologically active molecules.

         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8722;A&#8208;A COFs are constructed by a novel Lewis acid regulatory strategy. In here, Lewis acid sites can be used as electron acceptors to facilitate the separation and transfer of h+&#8722;e&#8722; pairs and further increase optoelectronic properties. Among them, PYBP&#8208;MgCl2&#8208;COF exhibited the best activity for the visible light&#8208;induced aerobic hydroxylation conversion of arylboronic acids with excellent yield and substrates compatibility.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent photoelectric properties, donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type photocatalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the limited D&#8722;A structural units of existing COFs restrict the development of novel and efficient photocatalytic COF materials. To solve this problem, we developed a series of D&#8722;A&#8208;A&#8208;type COFs utilizing a Lewis acid regulation strategy, in which Lewis acids act as the coordination centers, and pyridine and cyano groups act as ligands. Lewis acid sites in COFs serve as electron acceptors, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This process is crucial for photocatalysis because it significantly increases the efficiency of the catalytic reaction by reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers. The developed Lewis acid&#8208;activated D&#8722;A&#8208;A COFs efficiently catalyzed the hydroxylation of various phenylboronic acid compounds under visible light. The developed catalysts are expected to contribute to increasing the fabrication efficiency of industrially important organic materials.

A novel protocol for the efficient synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines through a chemselective one&#8208;pot cascade [4+2] annulation/aromatization between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and cyanamides has been described. The calculated studies well explained the chemoselectivity between carbodiimide anions and the isomerized cyanamide anions.







Abstract
The chemoselective [4+2] annulation/aromatization reactions between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and N&#8722;Ts cyanamides are developed, affording a convenient method for synthesizing benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines under mild conditions. Herein, N&#8722;Ts cyanamides participated in reactions selectively via carbodiimide anion intermediates and the corresponding cyanamide anion intermediates derived products were not observed. The proposed chemoselective stepwise reaction mechanism was well supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for the cancer treatment. Benefiting from nanomaterial strategies, the limitations of CRISPR&#8208;Cas system for in&#8197;vivo application are dramatically improved and can effectively regulate the tumor microenvironment, which provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenue for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial for cancer progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cells always plunder large amounts of nutrients and release various signals to their surroundings, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cells and the TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterial strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at the genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.

         <title>Computational Design of 3D Lantern Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a computational design of a new 3D Lantern Organic Framework&#8208;(LOFs) materials by using trisilasumanene and porphyrin&#8208;cored bases. Using Density Functional Theory shows that HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps of these 3D&#8208;LOFs are mainly determined by the base units, with minimal impact from vertical stacking via sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges on such a property. Consequently, 3D&#8208;LOF materials promisingly have various applications such as host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
This study employed a computational approach, particularly Density Functional Theory at B3LYP&#8722;D3/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to design two new classes of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Lantern Organic Frameworks (LOFs) materials based on trisilasumanene and porphyrin core building units. Particularly, we detail strategies for transitioning from 1D&#8208;LOF nanowires to extended 3D structures: first by connecting planar&#8208;molecule base units of trisilasumanene or porphyrin using benzene&#8208;based linkers, and then connecting silicon anchoring atoms on the bases with other bases that are vertically stacked by sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon chains. The 3D&#8208;LOF structures are designed to have different pore sizes through the use of various bases, bridges, and linkers. Comparisons of electronic properties of these 3D structures lead to one designing rule. That is, the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 3D materials depends only on its base and is nearly independent of the stack size or the length of the sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges. Additionally, connecting base units with linkers also extends &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation system leading to a reduction in HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. For instance, linking two trisilasumanene molecules significantly narrows HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by 1.75&#8197;eV while stacking these bases vertically and connecting them by linear pentane&#8208;based bridges yield insignificant change to the gap.

         <title>The Possible Aromatic Conjugation via the Different Edges of (Car)Borane Clusters: Can the Relationship Between 3D and 2D Aromatic Systems Be Reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between the 2D and 3D units in the (car)borane&#8208;fused 2D ring systems was investigated computationally. Although aromatic conjugation can be excluded, other factors, such as negative hyperconjugation and ring strain, play a crucial role in the overall stability of these systems and should be taken into account during their investigation.







Abstract
The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies proposed interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly as a Means to Study Mediated Thiol/Disulfide Exchange in Supramolecular Dynamic Covalent Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide formation and thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange are well&#8208;studied phenomena in dynamic covalent chemistry. We have shown previously that pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly enables formation of discrete disulfide assemblies using a variety of alkyl thiols. In this report we expand the method to include aryl thiols, and we show this self&#8208;assembly method revises some prevailing wisdom on product distributions in classical disulfide formation/exchange reactions.







Abstract
Thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange has been a large field of study for both biochemists and physical organic chemists alike due to its prevalence within biological systems and fundamentally interesting dynamic nature. More recently, efforts have been made to harness the power of this reversible reaction to make self&#8208;assembling systems of macrocyclic molecules. However, less effort has focused on the fundamental work of isolating these assemblies and studying the factors that control the assembly and sorting of these emerging cyclic systems. A more complete fundamental understanding of factors controlling such self&#8208;assembly could also improve understanding of the complex systems biology of thiol exchange while also aiding in the design of dynamic thiol assembly to enable applications ranging from drug delivery and biosensing to new materials synthesis. We have shown previously that pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly enables formation of discrete disulfide macrocycles and cages without competition from polymer formation for a wide variety of alkyl thiols. In this study, we report the expansion of pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly methods to form disulfide bearing macrocycles from aryl thiol containing ligands, allowing access to previously unreported molecules. These studies complement classical physical organic and chemical biology studies on the rates and products of aryl thiol oxidation to disulfides, and we show that this self&#8208;assembly method revises some prevailing wisdom from these key classical studies by providing new product distributions and new isolable products in cyclic disulfide formation.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties for PIII&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Buckybowls and Their Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) and their phosphonium salts are synthesized. The valence states of P&#8208;dopants exert discernible effects on the molecular geometries, electronic structures, photophysical properties, and chemical reactivities of P&#8208;doped HSEs.







Abstract
Doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with heteroatoms enables manipulation of their electronic structures. Herein, the structures and properties of phosphorus (P) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) are regulated by varying the valence states of P&#8208;dopant. The phosphine sulfide (PV) and chalcogens (S, Se, Te) co&#8208;doped HSEs (1&#8208;3) are reduced to trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped analogues 4&#8211;6. Then, the PIII&#8208;dopants on 4&#8211;6 are converted to phosphonium salts (R4P+), giving 7&#8211;9. The valence states of P&#8208;dopant show great influence on molecular geometries and electronic structures. Taking P and S co&#8208;doped HSEs as example, bowl&#8208;depths increase in the order of 1 (PV)&lt;7 (R4P+)&lt;4 (PIII), and the HOMO energy levels and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps increase to be 7&lt;1&lt;4. Consistent with the theoretical calculation, the first oxidation potentials decrease and the absorption/emission bands show blue shift from 7 to 1 to 4. The transformation of PV to PIII leads to large variations on the coordination with Ag+, owing to the alteration of coordination site from P=S to PIII. The phosphonium salts show ring&#8208;opening of phosphole rings under electrochemical reduction. It is found that chalcogen atoms play pivotal roles on coordination patterns of coordination complexes and the conversion rates of ring&#8208;opening reactions.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Nanosheets with Molecular Rotors for Pseudocapacitors: Nanoarchitectonics and Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel conjugated CNs develop by utilizing the full conjugation of the terpyridine&#8208;attached flexible tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units as the molecular rotors at the center. These nanosheets grow on bare Ni&#8208;foam through a hydrothermal route for pseudocapacitive application. Among three CNs, the high surface area with a favorable electronic configuration of RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co achieves a high specific capacity of 670.8&#8197;C/g at 1&#8197;A/g current density.







Abstract
High&#8208;level pseudocapacitive materials require incorporations of significant redox regions into conductive and penetrable skeletons to enable the creation of devices capable of delivering high power for extended periods. Coordination nanosheets (CNs) are appealing materials for their high natural electrical conductivities, huge explicit surface regions, and semi&#8208;one&#8208;layered adjusted pore clusters. Thus, rational design of ligands and topological networks with desired electronic structure is required for the advancement in this field. Herein, we report three novel conjugated CNs (RV&#8208;10&#8208;M, M=Zn, Ni, and Co), by utilizing the full conjugation of the terpyridine&#8208;attached flexible tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units as the molecular rotors at the center. We prepare binder&#8208;free transparent nanosheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam with outstanding pseudocapacitive properties via a hydrothermal route followed by facile exfoliation. Among three CNs, the high surface area of RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co facilitates fast transport of ions and electrons and could achieve a high specific capacity of 670.8&#8197;C/g (1677&#8197;F/g) at 1&#8197;A/g current density. Besides, the corresponding flexible RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co possesses a maximum energy density of 37.26&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 171&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70&#8201;% capacitance retention even after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for the Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are particularly advantageous for electrochemical ammonia synthesis due to their low cost, high efficiency, and readily available resources. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the properties and catalytic mechanisms of various nickel&#8208;based catalysts employed in nitrogen reduction reactions. Furthermore, it explores future research directions for advancing nickel&#8208;based catalyst technologies.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While useful tools for studying perfluorocarbons, fluorous soluble fluorophores (fluorofluorophores) are often less bright and prone to rapid photobleaching in the fluorous phase. Here, we utilized a counterion modification on a fluorous pentatmethine dye (FCy5) to promote favorable cyanine character, resulting in a brighter and more photostable fluorofluorophore.







Abstract
Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen Complexes as DNA Binders and Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated cytotoxic agents are attractive compounds as potential anticancer drugs. A library of 21 platinum(II) complexes is presented together with a systematic study of their DNA binding affinities, photophysical and photochemical properties, cellular imaging and phototoxicity. A lead compound has been identified which is not toxic in the dark against cancer cells, but toxic at nanomolar concentrations upon irradiation.







Abstract
Current anticancer therapies suffer from issues such as off&#8208;target side effects and the emergence of drug resistance; therefore, the discovery of alternative therapeutic approaches is vital. These can include the development of drugs with different modes of action, and the exploration of new biomolecular targets. For the former, there has been increasing interest in drugs that are activated by an external stimulus (e.&#8201;g. light irradiation) to generate cytotoxic chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the latter, significant efforts are being directed to explore non&#8208;canonical DNA and RNA structures (e.&#8201;g. guanine&#8208;quadruplexes), as alternative biomolecular targets. Herein we report the synthesis of a library of 21 new platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen complexes (square planar platinum(II) complexes coordinated to tetradentate O,N,N,O&#8208;Schiff base ligands), and the investigation, for all complexes, of their photophysical and photochemical properties, their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA, and their cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells both in the dark and upon light irradiation. Thanks to the intrinsic phosphorescence of the platinum(II) complexes, confocal microscopy was used for six of the complexes to determine their cellular permeability and localisation in two cancer cell lines (HeLa and U2OS). Altogether, these studies have allowed us to identify two lead platinum(II) complexes with high guanine&#8208;quadruplex DNA affinity and selectivity, good cell permeability and nuclear localisation, and high cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells upon irradiation with no detected cytotoxicity in the dark.

Chiral fluorolactones A novel chiral sulfoxide&#8208;imine&#8208;olefin ligand is applyed to a rhodium catalyzed allylic substitution with monofluoro building block, resulting in high regio&#8208; and enantioselective fluorine containing allylic compounds which can be transferred to chiral fluorinated &#948;&#8208;lactones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of the racemic branched allylic substrates with 2&#8208;fluoromalonate was realized enabled by a novel chiral sulfoxide&#8208;imine&#8208;olefin ligand under mild reaction conditions. The utilization of CuSO4 is beneficial for improving the enantioselectivity. Notably, the chiral fluoro&#8208;containing allyl products can be employed in a selective cyclic esterification to form chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorolactone bearing vicinal stereogenic centers.

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8722;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc complex of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8722;1) ligand is presented. This Zn complex allows access to various other P(&#8722;1)&#8208;ligated species through transmetallation. Additionally, the reaction of an FLP&#8208;chelated P(+1) compound with Na[Co(CO)4] leads to an &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex which is isoelectronic to &#951;2&#8208;olefin complexes.







Abstract
Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8722;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8722; are presented (Cy=cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: affording a tellurium bis(phosphido) complex and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in&#8197;situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8722;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.

Lastly, we report a formal &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8722;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; density functional theory (DFT) computations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Photooxidation via Singlet Oxygen Generation by Triplet Harvesting in a Heavy Atom Free Pure Organic Dithienylethene&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The content demonstrated efficient control over singlet oxygen generation using a switchable photosensitizer, where the open isomeric form of compound 7 indicated &#8220;on&#8208;state&#8221; and the closed isomeric form of compound 7 effectively switch &#8220;off&#8221; the singlet oxygen generation process.







Abstract
Noninvasive control over the reversible generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) has found the enormous practical implications in the field of biomedical science. However, metal&#8208;free pure organic emitters, connected with a photoswitch, capable of generating &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; 1O2 via triplet harvesting remain exceedingly rare; therefore, the utilization of these organic materials for the reversible control of singlet oxygen production remains at its infancy. Herein, an ambient triplet mediated emission in quinoline&#8208;dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivative is unveiled via delayed fluorescence. The quinoline&#8208;DTE&#8208;cNDI triad displayed enhanced photoswitching efficiency via double FRET mechanism. It was found to have direct utilization in controlled photosensitized organic transformations via efficient generation of singlet oxygen (yield &#934;&#916;~0.55 in DCM and 0.73 in methanol). The designed molecule exhibits a long&#8208;lived emission (&#964;&#8764;1.1&#8197;&#956;s) and very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) of 0.13&#8197;eV empowering it to display delayed fluorescence. Comprehensive steady state and time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analyses along with DFT calculations offer detailed understandings into the excited&#8208;state manifolds of organic compound and energy transfer (ET) pathways involved in 1O2 generation.

         <title>Metal Cocatalyst Engineering in Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Hybrid Photocatalysts Achieves a Fivefold Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of metal tips on CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted. The optimized configuration, a gold&#8208;platinum core&#8208;shell tip with a rough surface, showed a remarkable fivefold quantum efficiency enhancement, exhibiting the maximum hydrogen&#8208;evolution rates under visible and AM1.5&#8197;G irradiation. Kinetic study reveals a large extent and a longer lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips.







Abstract
This study explores the optimal morphology of photochemical hydrogen evolution catalysts in a one&#8208;dimensional system. Systematic engineering of metal tips on precisely defined CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted to exert control over morphology, composition, and both factors. The outcome yields an optimized configuration, a Au&#8722;Pt core&#8208;shell structure with a rough Pt surface (Au@r&#8208;Pt), which exhibits a remarkable fivefold increase in quantum efficiency, reaching 86&#8201;% at 455&#8197;nm and superior hydrogen evolution rates under visible and AM1.5&#8197;G irradiation conditions with prolonged stability. Kinetic investigations using photoelectrochemical and time&#8208;resolved measurements demonstrate a greater extent and extended lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips as well as rapid water reduction kinetics on high&#8208;energy surfaces. This approach sheds light on the critical role of cocatalysts in hybrid photocatalytic systems for achieving high performance.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of GeTe Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this work is preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by low temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors. The GeTe nanoparticles are amorphous and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering.







Abstract
Nanoparticles can offer an alternative approach to fabricate phase&#8208;change materials. The chemical synthesis of GeTe nanoparticles using organometallic precursors exploits high&#8208;boiling solvents and relatively high temperatures (close or even above crystallization temperatures), as reported in the available literature. The aim of this work is the preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by a low&#8208;temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors and common organic solvents. Indeed, different preparation methods and characterization of GeTe nanoparticles is discussed. The characterization of the prepared nanomaterial was performed on the basis of X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results show that the low&#8208;temperature synthetic route leads to amorphous GeTe nanoparticles. Exploited organometallic precursor is stabilised by neutral ligand which can be isolated after the reaction and repeatedly used for further reactions. Furthermore, GeTe nanoparticle size can be tuned by the conditions of the synthesis.

         <title>Urea Ligand&#8208;Promoted Chainwalking Heteroannulation for the Synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered Azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea ligands promote chainwalking heteroannulation reactions for the synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered azaheterocycles from a common set of precursors. In this reaction, ureas outperform established ligands for Pd&#8208;catalyzed chainwalking processes, particularly for more challenging substrates such as 1,5&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Typical approaches to heterocycle construction require significant changes in synthetic strategy even for a change as minor as increasing the ring size. The ability to access multiple heterocyclic scaffolds through a common synthetic approach, simply through trivial modification of one reaction component, would enable facile access to diverse libraries of structural analogues of core scaffolds. Here, we show that urea&#8208;derived ligands effectively promote Pd&#8208;mediated chainwalking processes to enable remote heteroannulation for the rapid construction of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered azaheterocycles under essentially identical reaction conditions. This method demonstrates good functional group tolerance and effectively engages sterically hindered substrates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to target&#8208;oriented synthesis, demonstrated through the formal synthesis of antimalarial alkaloid galipinine.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused BOPAM Fluorophores: Synthesis, Post&#8208;functionalization, Photophysical Properties and Acid sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and photophysical analysis of asymmetric boron chromophores, BOPAM, reveal solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and ICT pathways, highlighting their potential in pH&#8208;sensing applications, as demonstrated through systematic experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
A novel category of asymmetric boron chromophores with the attachment of two BF2 moieties denoted as BOPAM has been successfully synthesized via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step reaction starting from N&#8208;phenylbenzothioamide. This synthetic route results in the production of [a] and [b]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs along with post&#8208;functionalization of the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been systematically investigated through steady&#8208;state absorption and fluorescence emission measurements in solvents at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures, as well as in the solid state. Computational methods have been employed to elucidate the emissive characteristics of the benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs, revealing distinctive photophysical attributes, including solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity. Remarkably, certain BOPAM derivatives exhibit noteworthy photophysical phenomena, such as the induction of off&#8208;on fluorescence emission under specific solvent conditions and the manifestation of intermolecular charge transfer states in solid&#8208;state matrices. Through post&#8208;functionalization strategies involving the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups onto the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM scaffold, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) pathway is activated, leading to substantial fluorescence quenching via non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Notably, one [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM variant exhibits a pronounced fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to acidic conditions, thereby underscoring its potential utility in pH&#8208;sensing applications.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and photophysical analysis of asymmetric boron chromophores, BOPAM, reveal solvent-dependent fluorescence and ICT pathways, highlighting their potential in pH-sensing applications, as demonstrated through systematic experimental and computational studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel category of asymmetric boron chromophores with the attachment of two BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moieties denoted as BOPAM has been successfully synthesized &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a one-pot three-step reaction starting from N-phenylbenzothioamide. This synthetic route results in the production of [a] and [b]benzo-fused BOPAMs along with post-functionalization of the [a]benzo-fused BOPAMs. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been systematically investigated through steady-state absorption and fluorescence emission measurements in solvents at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures, as well as in the solid state. Computational methods have been employed to elucidate the emissive characteristics of the benzo-fused BOPAMs, revealing distinctive photophysical attributes, including solvent-dependent fluorescence intensity. Remarkably, certain BOPAM derivatives exhibit noteworthy photophysical phenomena, such as the induction of off-on fluorescence emission under specific solvent conditions and the manifestation of intermolecular charge transfer states in solid-state matrices. Through post-functionalization strategies involving the introduction of electron-donating groups onto the [a]benzo-fused BOPAM scaffold, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) pathway is activated, leading to substantial fluorescence quenching &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; non-radiative decay processes. Notably, one [a]benzo-fused BOPAM variant exhibits a pronounced fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to acidic conditions, thereby underscoring its potential utility in pH-sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assay for Characterizing Adsorption&#8208;Properties of Surfaces (APS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With APS the types of interactions can be determined causing adsorption of analytes to surfaces, driven by partition of analytes between the sample liquid and the solid surface having contact with the sample liquid. This is especially helpful for estimation of analyte loss occurring by their binding to surfaces during sample preparation and analysis and for developing measures for minimizing loss of analytes. The test is based on the quantification of probes consisting of thousands of defined peptides spanning a broad range of chemical properties. Interpretation of APS results is facilitated by an automated script&#8208;based analysis.







Abstract
Analytes, from sample preparation, until entering an analytical instrument, are prone to adsorb to surfaces, driven by the chemical properties of the surface and the liquids they are dissolved in. This problem can be addressed with internal standards when a single or few known analytes are quantified that are usually not available in omics. However, minimal to no loss of analytes is the aim. Here, we present a novel assay for qualifying and quantifying interactions responsible for adsorption of molecules to surfaces (APS) by using LC&#8211;MS/MS&#8208;based differential quantitative analysis. To reflect a broad range of chemical interactions with surfaces, a reference mixture of thousands of tryptic peptides, with known compositions was selected, representing a variety of different chemical characteristics. The assay was tested by investigating the adsorption properties of several different vials with different surface chemistries. A significant number of hydrophobic peptides adsorbed to conventional polypropylene vials. In contrast, only few peptides adsorbed to polypropylene vials, assigned as low&#8208;protein&#8208;binding. The highest number of peptides adsorbed to glass vials driven by electrostatic interactions. In summary, the new assay is suitable to characterize adsorption properties of different surfaces and to approximate the loss of analytes during sample preparation.

         <title>Overriding Cage Effect in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Photoactivation of Diaryliodonium Reagents: Synthesis of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electron donor&#8208;acceptor photoactivation platform of diaryliodonium reagents, where generated aryl radicals override the cage effect to get captured by dichalcogenides en route to the synthesis of a wide variety of di(hetero)aryl and aryl&#8208;alkyl chalcogenides. The chalcogenation technology applies to late&#8208;stage functionalizations and disulfide bioconjugations and facilitates access to bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
In recent times, diaryliodonium reagents (DAIRs) have witnessed a resurgence as arylating reagents, especially under photoinduced conditions. However, reactions proceeding through electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation with DAIRs are restricted to electron&#8208;rich reacting partners serving as donors due to the well&#8208;known cage effect. We discovered a practical and high&#8208;yielding visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced EDA platform to generate aryl radicals from the corresponding DAIRs and use them to synthesize key chalcogenides. In this process, an array of DAIRs and dichalcogenides react in the presence of 1,4 diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a cheap and readily available donor, furnishing a variety of di(hetero)aryl and aryl/alkyl chalcogenides in good yields. The method is scalable, features a broad scope with good yields, and operates under open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions. The photoinduced chalcogenation technology is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalizations and disulfide bioconjugations and facilitates access to biologically relevant thioesters, dithiocarbamates, sulfoximines, and sulfones. Moreover, the method applies to synthesizing diverse pharmaceuticals, such as vortioxetine, promazine, mequitazine, and dapsone, under amenable conditions.

         <title>Enzyme Fueled Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly of Guanine Functionalized Molecules and Their Cellular Behaviour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report investigates how the self&#8208;assembly of a G&#8208;quadruplex impacts the hydrolysis equilibrium in reverse. The enzyme lipase activates the individual building blocks through fuel consumption, leading them to organize themselves more effectively into nanofibers within spheres. The utility of the nucleopeptide NAC5 hydrogel as a biomaterial for wound repair is demonstrated through a cell migration experiment using a scratch assay.







Abstract
Generally, an esterase lipase enzyme can hydrolyze specific substrates called esters in an aqueous solution. Herein, we investigate how a G&#8208;quadruplex self&#8208;assembly affects the hydrolysis equilibrium in reverse. The biocatalyst, lipase, activates the individual building&#8208;blocks through fuel consumption, causing them to undergo a higher degree of self&#8208;organization into nanofibers within spheres. We have synthesized five peptide&#8208;lipid&#8208;conjugated guanine base functionalized molecules to explore how the equilibrium can be shifted through reverse hydrolysis. Among these, NAC5 self&#8208;assembled into a G&#8208;quadruplex structure which has been confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. The wide&#8208;angle powder XRD, ThT dye binding assay and circular dichroism study is carried out to support the presence of the G&#8208;quadruplex structure. The biocatalytic formation of nanofibers enclosed spheres is analyzed using CLSM, FE&#8208;SEM and HR&#8208;TEM experiments. Additionally, we assess the biocompatibility of the enzyme fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembled fibers enclosed spheres, as they have potential applications as a biomaterial in protocells. MTT assay is performed to check the cytotoxicity of G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogel, using HEK 293 and McCoy cell lines for viability assessment. Finally, the utility of the novel NAC5 hydrogel as a wound repairing biomaterial is demonstrated by cell migration experiment in a scratch assay.

         <title>Bismuth Nanoparticles and Single Iron Atoms on Carbon Derived from a Covalent Organic Framework Synergistically Catalyze the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article synthesizes a carbon catalyst in which bismuth nanoparticles and single iron atoms on covalent organic framework&#8208;derived carbon synergistically catalyze oxygen reduction reactions. The catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.867&#8197;V and a high current density of 6.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, which has great potential in oxygen reduction catalyst applications.







Abstract
The utilization of catalysts comprising metal nanoparticle has been beneficial for enhancing the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the inadequate intrinsic activity of these catalysts still presents a significant challenge, limiting their overall effectiveness. This issue can be addressed by introducing single atoms, which can create a synergistic effect with the nanoparticles to catalyse and thereby improve performance. Nevertheless, the synergistic catalysis of nanoparticles and single atoms is still under investigation. In this study, we fabricated a core&#8208;shell structured carbon framework incorporating Fe single atoms and Bi nanoparticles through the pyrolysis of COF and MOF core&#8208;shell structures. Introducing Fe single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8, with Fe&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 as the core and Bi&#8208;containing COF as the shell, resulted in higher ORR activity. The catalyst exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.867&#8197;V and a high current density of 6.68&#8197;mA&#8197;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, which were comparable to those of Pt/C equivalent.
This study provides new research concepts for exploring the application of single atoms and nanoparticles in catalytic oxygen reduction reactions through synergistic effects.

         <dc:description>The escalating threat posed by antibiotic resistance is a global concern and underscores the need for new antibiotics. In this context, the recent discovery of evybactin, a nonribosomal depsipeptide antibiotic that selectively and potently inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis, is particularly noteworthy. Here, we present the first total synthesis of this natural product, along with a revision of its assigned structure. Our studies revealed a disparity between the structure originally proposed for evybactin and its actual configuration. Specifically, the 3&#8208;methylhistidine residue present in the evybactin core macrocycle was found to be of the d&#8208;configuration rather than the previously assigned l&#8208;His(Me). Having addressed this, we further optimized our solid&#8208;phase synthetic route to provide access to evybactin on a multi&#8208;hundred&#8208;milligram scale. Access to such quantities will allow for more comprehensive studies with this promising antibiotic.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Regulation of a Multi&#8208;Component Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing efficient and durable non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi&#8208;component composite of Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two&#8208;step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal&#8208; and non&#8208;metal&#8208;based species, Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3 mV dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term stability over 100 h in an alkaline solution. Post&#8208;characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N&#8208;doped carbon, and new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi&#8208;components to fabricate efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Higly Luminescent Aceno[6]helicenones by Intramolecular Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes and helicenoid structures are promising candidates for future applications exploiting circularly polarized light. Ideal candidates should possess near&#8208;quantitative photoluminescence quantum yield, high a luminescence dissymmetry factor and an adjustable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. However, carbo[n]helicenes are poorly luminescent compounds and they absorb light mainly in the ultraviolet region. Here we show that the incorporation of a carbonyl group into helical scaffold significantly improves the fluorescence quantum yield and shifts the absorption to visible region. Although the carbonyl group is commonly considered as detrimental to efficient emission, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934; = 0.43 were recorded. A straightforward synthetic approach to a highly luminescent tetraceno[6]helicenone and an aza analogue has been developed. The key step is a radical cyclization which is achieving dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension. The aza&#8208;analogue was incorporated as an emitter in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and showed good performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A library of novel &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzo&#173;coronene (HBC) architectures is presented. Two distinct synthetic pathways were utilized to obtain either phenyl&#8208; or HBC&#8208;fused compounds. Absorption experiments reveal the species' exciting photophysical and optoelectronic properties. Depending on the degree of &#960;&#8208;extension, the number of porphyrins, and their relative position, a decisive change in shape, panchromatic broadening, and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption curves is observed. Theoretical studies give more profound insight into the molecule's electronic structures, showing vast decreases in band energy gaps.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reliable radical precursors are crucial for photocatalytic processes. In particular, heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals have attracted considerable research interest in photocatalysis. Among them, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals have received the most attention, while the research on &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals is much less developed. Herein, we present O&#8208;PMP &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as novel precursors for the formation of oxygen&#8208;stabilized radicals. These radicals have been successfully used as building blocks in Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylation reactions, Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkenylation reactions, and Giese reactions. A subsequent deprotection step liberates the corresponding hydroxyalkylation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparison of Different Organometallics Towards Electrophilic Aromatic 211At&#8208;Astatinations of Highly Reactive Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organometallics can be used as precursors for electrophilic 211At&#8208;statinations. In this report, we compared the potential of aryl trimethylsilanes, &#8208;germanes, or &#8211;stannanes to be used as precursors to 211At&#8208;label highly reactive tetrazines. Tetrazines can be used for pretargeted radioligand therapies or be applied as synthons to radiolabel rapidly and orthogonally a broad set of precursors such as peptides, mAbs or nanomedicines. All precursors could successfully be synthesized and radiolabeled. The reactivity of organogermanium reagents ranged between those of respective organotin and organosilicon precursors. Moreover, organogermanium reagents proved promising for accessing more complex and polar tetrazine scaffolds. In contrast to organotin derivatives, the use of protecting groups could be avoided for organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors. The developed 211At&#8208;labeled tetrazines could be labeled in radiochemical conversions of 60&#8208;90%. Organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors were clearly advantaged as additional deprotection steps could avoided. Reported labeling procedures allow astatinations of highly reactive tetrazines to be used for pretargeted approaches or to applied as highly reactive synthons to label the next&#8208;generation of 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Polynuclear Niobium Oxynitride Cluster Anions Nb4N5&#8211;xOx&#8722; (x = 0&#8211;5) toward N2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of N&#8322; under mild conditions remains a significant challenge in chemistry. Understanding how the composition of ligands modulates the reactivity of metal centers is pivotal for the rational design of efficient catalysts for nitrogen fixation. Herein, the reactions between polynuclear niobium oxynitride anions Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x = 0&#8211;5) and N2 were investigated by employing mass spectrometry, photoelectron imaging spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The rate constants of Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722;/N2 gradually decrease for x = 0 to x = 4, and then increase again for x = 5. The sharp increase of the rate constants of Nb4O5&#8722;/N2 corresponds to a decrease in the electron detachment energy of the Nb4O5&#8722; cluster in the photoelectron spectroscopic experiment. Theoretical calculations suggest that the low&#8208;coordinated Nb&#8208;Nb site in Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x = 0&#8211;5) behaves as the active center to bind N2 in the side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on manner. Mechanistic analysis reveals that raising the O/N ratio leads to higher electron densities on the active Nb&#8208;Nb center and decreased positive charge on the metal atoms, which hinders the approach of N2 to the clusters. This finding discloses fundamental insights into the impact of N/O ratios in fine&#8208;tuning the reactivity of metal centers towards N2 adsorption in related catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover and Its Application in Organometallic Catalysis: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin crossover is one of the most important properties of open&#8208;shell metal complexes. In organometallic catalytic reactions, catalysts can alter reaction kinetics by spin crossover, i.e., accelerating or hindering the reaction progression, as well as altering reaction pathways, modulating the reaction selectivity or promoting new reactions. This personal account outlines the introduction and development of important concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; involving spin crossover, and proposes a new concept, "spin&#8208;responsive catalysis" to summarize the catalytic processes in which spin effects are present. Finally, the electronic mechanism of spin crossover accelerating the reaction and the role of spin crossover in changing the reaction path and regulating the reaction selectivity are introduced by taking two recent typical iron&#8208;catalyzed reactions recently reported by our group as examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with Efficient Charge Mobility and Separation Capabilities Studied by DFT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of the active layer materials play a decisive role in determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Chlorophyll and its derivatives are abundant and environmentally friendly functional organic molecular materials. Using density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT), we have calculated the absorption spectra and their excited state properties based on optimized ground state structures. It was found that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior structural properties, a smaller energy gap and hole reorganization energy, redshifted absorption spectra, and higher hole mobility compared to the donor D18. This suggests that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior donor properties. Comparative studies between o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl showed that o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl had superior acceptor properties, implying that differences in substitution positions can influence the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Subsequently, six bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were constructed by combining three donors with nonfused ring electron acceptors, o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl. The bacteriochlorin&#8208;based BHJs performed well among them, with BChl3/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and BChl4/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl having the largest interfacial charge separation rate. The results suggested that BHJs composed of bacteriochlorin and NFAs can improve OSCs' photovoltaic performance, providing a feasible scheme for designing efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Toluene Derivatives under HAT and ROS Synergy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of toluene offers a dual solution by addressing its environmental impact while also facilitating the synthesis of a diverse array of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, thus ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability. We report herein a synergistic approach that harmonizes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mild condition and low catalyst loading, which enables the efficient synthesis of a broad spectrum of esteemed benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones through the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives. Mechanistic elucidation reveals that the HAT reagent anthraquinone has both the capabilities to abstract hydrogen atoms and the ability to generate singlet oxygen 1O2 during energy transfer with triplet oxygen 3O2, and the combination of these two potencies significantly improves the catalytic efficiency of the reaction. This study not only introduces the amalgamation of HAT with ROS generation but also delineates a systematic approach for the selection of HAT reagents with energy transfer proficiency for ROS generation in catalytic oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Triscyanocorrole, the Newest and Most Intriguing Member of the C1&#8208;Substituted Corrole Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the potential advantages of minimally sized corroles for diverse applications, this study reports a facile access to cyano&#8208;substituted derivatives via a rare CF3/CN conversion. Investigation of the fully characterized gallium, phosphorus, and cobalt complexes discloses multiple effects of the meso&#8208;nitrile groups attached to the macrocycle. This corrole appears to be the most electron poor derivative which comes into play in the redox potentials of the corresponding complexes. Compared to its precursor, both the absorption and emission are strongly red shifted and the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield are much larger. The coordination chemistry is affected as well, by virtue of axial ligands being perpendicular rather than parallel relative to each other.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Ultrafast Excitation Energy Transfer in Tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;BODIPY Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized two dyads (dyad 1 and 2) comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY. In dyad 1, two BODIPYs are directly connected with TAPP moiety whereas in dyad 2, BODIPYs are connected through phenylethynyl linkers. TAPP is a blue energy donor which is easy to synthesize and functionalize as compared to other well&#8208;known blue energy donors like pyrene, perylene etc. This is the first report of using TAPP as an energy donor in BODIPY based dyad molecules. Complete quenching of TAPP fluorescence in the dyads suggests fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE ~ 99.9%). Ultrafast fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies of dyad 1 showed TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125 fs (kET = 8.0 x 1012 s&#8208;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far. Whereas, in dyad 2, energy transfer is almost four times slower (480 fs, kET = 2.1 x 1012 s&#8208;1). These results were rationalized by theoretical F&#246;rster formulations. This study shows that suitably matched optical properties of TAPP and BODIPY dyes along with their easy syntheses will be the key to develop highly efficient energy transfer systems in future for multiple applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogenization of Palladium Trimer and Nanoparticles through Polymerization Boosted Catalytic Efficiencies in Recyclable Coupling and Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of heterogeneous palladium catalysts has shown continuous vitality in the field of catalysis and materials. In this work, we report one concise free radical&#160;polymerization approach to accomplish the aromatic palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+&#160;(2) and its&#160;derived palladium nanoparticles (3). Full characterizations&#160;could confirm&#160;the successful combination of cationic [Pd3]+&#160;or nanoparticles with poly(p&#8208;sulfonated styrene) skeleton. Compared to their monomeric tri&#8208;palladium precursor (1) and common&#160;Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, heterogeneous PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+&#160;(2) shows&#160;much superior catalytic activities (0.15 mol%, TOF = 1333.3&#160;h&#8208;1) in the SMCC reaction. The identically ligated PdNPs (3)&#160;are formed in&#8208;suit&#160;in the presence of NaBH4&#160;and&#160;accomplish quantitative reduction of&#160;4&#8208;nitrophenol in just 320&#160;s&#160;(0.50 mol%, TOF = 2250 h&#8208;1).&#160;Moreover, these heterogeneous catalysts are&#160;reused for 5&#8208;6&#160;times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Their superior catalytic ability is&#160;probably attributed to the synergistic effect of polymer entanglement and the tri&#8208;palladium fragment.&#160;This work enlightens&#160;that the immobilization of palladium&#160;clusters&#160;or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency&#160;and recyclability&#160;for&#160;their involved&#160;catalyses and show far&#8208;reaching future implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemistry with Plane&#8208;Polarized Light: Controlling Selectivity of a Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past 50 years, a principal approach to controlling conventional photochemical reactions has relied on imposing geometric constraints on reactant or transition state via conducting photochemistry in the organized or constraining media. Herein, we describe a fundamentally different approach to affect the course of photochemical reactions (photochemical rearrangements) by utilizing spatially selective excitation of specific electronic transitions with plane&#8208;polarized light in the reactant molecules uniformly aligned in the nematic liquid crystal phase. In particular, we focused on the Type B enone rearrangement of 4,4&#8208;diarylcyclohexenones &#8208;&#160;one of the most common photochemical rearrangements. We demonstrated that the aryl migratory aptitude in this reaction was attenuated in response to changing an angle between the polarization plane of the incident light and the alignment direction of nematic liquid crystal, with the enhanced aryl migration achieved when the polarization plane coincided with the transition dipole moment leading to the excited state responsible for this migration. The spatially&#8208;selective initial excitation therefore was overruling the electronic factors responsible for the relative ratio of the two alternative photoproducts. The experimental findings were further supported by the results of a computational study. This work showcases a new fundamental paradigm in controlling photochemical reactivity and selectivity of photoreactions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;Steric Activation in the Nazarov Cyclization of Fully Substituted Divinyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully substituted divinyl ketones (fsDVKs) have long been regarded as resistant to Nazarov cyclization (NC) unless they contain strategically positioned electronically&#8208;activating substituents. Here, however, we show that fsDVKs bearing only electronically neutral alkyl or aryl groups actually undergo facile NC due to steric&#8208;crowding in the pentadienyl cation intermediate, which raises its energy and reduces the barrier height to cyclization. Strongly ionizing and suitably bulky acid moieties further increase the energy of this intermediate cation, favoring cyclization. These features enable NCs of fsDVKs to be employed in the ready construction of multiple contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions, in the absence&#160; of electronically activating groups.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with kagom&#233; lattice are attractive for their unique physical and chemical properties, but little attention has been paid to their catalytic properties. Herein, we report a 2D MOF based on a phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand (NaHL), i.e., [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 (2), which exhibits an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice. The formation of this kagom&#233; lattice is caused by the selective recognition of the NO3&#8208; anion by the phenolato group of L2&#8208; as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Compound 2 can be utilized for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones using methanol as a C1 source. Interestingly, compound 2 can be exfoliated in&#8208;situ into nanosheets with one&#8208;layer thickness under catalytic reaction conditions, which improves the catalytic efficiency. Based on the results of experiments and theoretical calculations, we proposed possible pathways for the catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;assembly: An Alternative Strategy for the Construction of Coordination Oligomers and Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled oligonuclear and polynuclear complexes have numerous functionalities and potential applications. Generally, such compounds have been constructed by thermal substitution reactions with bridging ligands. Herein, we report bottom&#8208;up and photochemical construction of functional coordination oligomers and polymers by photosubstitution&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and pentanuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru1&#8211;Ru5, which have one&#8208;dimensional architectures. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between each bridging ligand is a key to construct the molecular nanowires. All the complexes have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers. The multinuclear complexes are generated by photoinduced self&#8208;assembly in the presence of a base, and they undergo photoinduced disassembly in the presence of acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Transformation of Benzylic Carboxylic Acids to Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols play a crucial role as core structural motifs in natural products and also serve as fundamental building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Apart from the known protocols for the conversion of aryl precursors to phenols (i.e., decarboxylative oxygenation), we report here the efficient synthesis of phenols from the stable and readily available benzylic carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions. The photocatalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to peroxides is a crucial step in this strategy, allowing the subsequent C&#8208;O bond formation via Hock rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic porosity and interface synergy enhanced gas permselectivity in heterolayer metal&#8208;organic framework membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of sustainable, carbon&#8208;free separation technology hinges on the efficient separation of gas mixtures with high separation factors and flow rates, i.e. high permselectivity. However, achieving this objective is arduous due to the meticulous engineering at the angstrom scale and intricate chemical manipulation required to design the pores within membranes. To address this challenge, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an anisotropic porous membrane has been devised. Employing a meticulous step&#8208;by&#8208;step methodology, two distinct porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are integrated to form a monolithic anisotropic membrane. By harnessing pore anisotropy (3.4 to 6 &#197;) aligned with the gas permeation direction and a unique interface characterized by cross&#8208;linked pores derived from the two distinct MOFs, this membrane transcends the performance limitations inherent in the individual MOF membranes (~45% enhanced selectivity). This approach not only sheds light on the heterolayer membrane design strategy but also elucidates the intricate CO2/N2 permselectivity relationship inherent in the interface structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Cu(II) Labeling for Distance Measurements on Proteins by EPR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;cell measurements of the relationship between structure and dynamics to protein function is at the forefront of biophysics. Recently, developments in EPR methodology have demonstrated the sensitivity and power of this method to measure structural constraints in&#8208;cell. However, the need to spin label proteins ex&#8208;situ or use noncanonical amino acids to achieve endogenous labeling remains a bottleneck. In this work we expand the methodology to endogenously spin label proteins with Cu(II) spin labels and describe how to assess in&#8208;cell spin labeling. We quantify the amount of Cu(II)&#8208;NTA in cells, assess spin labeling, and account for orientational effects during distance measurements. We compare the efficacy of using heat&#8208;shock and hypotonic swelling to deliver spin label, showing that hypotonic swelling is a facile and reproducible method to efficiently deliver Cu(II)&#8208;NTA into E. coli. Notably, over six repeats we accomplish a bulk average of 57 &#956;M spin labeled sites, surpassing existing endogenous labeling methods. The results of this work open the door for endogenous spin labeling that is easily accessible to the broader biophysical community.</dc:description>

         <title>Model catalytic studies on the thermal dehydrogenation of the benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol LOHC system on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the dehydrogenation reaction and the thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol on a Pt(111) model catalyst in situ in synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy&#8208; and complementary temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments. The system stores hydrogen in a cyclohexyl group and a primary alcohol functionality and achieves an attractive hydrogen storage capacity of 7.0 mass%. We observed a stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism, characterized by a low temperature dehydrogenation of the alcohol group at 235 K. However, stability limitations challenge the system&#8217;s applicability as reversible hydrogen storage solution, as the resultant aldehyde was found to decompose during the dehydrogenation of its cyclohexyl group (between 250 and 350 K). A comparison of cyclohexylmethanol with the structurally related secondary alcohol (1&#8208;cyclo&#173;hexylethanol; 6.3 mass% hydrogen) revealed a parallel stepwise dehydrogenation pattern for both compounds, but a technically relevant superior thermal robustness of the latter. This demonstrates the influence of the alcohol group&#8217;s substitution degree on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHC compounds. Density functional theory calculations are in good agreement with the experimentally observed stability trend.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulation and Release of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients using a Supramolecular Self&#8208;healing Two&#8208;component Gel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) formed from a modified amino acid and an aldehyde was formulated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Basic APIs (propranolol, atropine) can be mixed with the LMWG prior to gel assembly while acidic APIs (naproxen, rosuvastatin) inhibit assembly by disrupting the LMWG imine bond and were loaded by diffusion after gel assembly. For diffusion&#8208;loaded gels, the API in the liquid&#8208;like phase was rapidly released, with the remainder, interacting with gel fibres, retained in the gel. Rosuvastatin release was particularly low with STD NMR indicating interactions between the aromatic ring and the self&#8208;assembled gel network. Propranolol also interacted with the gel via its aromatic unit, and its release led to gel erosion. Using agarose as a polymer gelator additive reinforced the gel, restricting erosion. In contrast, atropine was readily released over a period of hours &#8211; it is primarily in the liquid&#8208;like phase with STD NMR indicating no interactions with the gel network. The atropine&#8208;loaded gel retained its thixotropic properties. Overall, APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation/release. Of the APIs investigated, atropine has most potential for further development. Atropine has applications in treating myopia, and our results suggest potential ophthalmic applications of supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Demonstrating Synergistic Activity of Magnetic Iron Oxide Nano Photocatalyst for C&#8211;H Activation in Heterogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes a dual catalytic approach for the versatile C&#8210;H arylation of arenes under photo&#8208;excitation at room temperature. The cooperative catalysis utilizes iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (which mostly contain Fe3O4 along with some &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3) as the potential photocatalyst, which merges with the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H activation cycle for the reductive generation of aryl radical from aryl diazonium salt, revealing its photocatalytic activities. The method is applicable to a wide range of aryl coupling partners and different directing groups, demonstrating excellent productivity, nice co&#8208;operativity and recyclability. Adequate control experiments and mechanistic studies assisted in establishing the radical&#8208;based mechanism for the C&#8210;H arylation occurring in the heterogeneous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ polymerized solid/quasi&#8208;solid&#160;polymer&#160;electrolyte&#160;for lithium&#8208;metal batteries: recent progress and perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pursuit of high energy density, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are undoubtedly the best choice. However, leakage and inevitable dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes seriously hinder its practical application. Solid/quasi&#8208;solid state&#160;electrolytes have emerged as an answer to solve the above issues. Especially, polymer electrolytes with excellent interface compatibility, high flexibility, and ease of machining have become a research hotspot for LMBs. Nevertheless,&#160;the interface contact between polymer electrolyte and inorganic electrode materials and the low ionic conductivity restrict its development. On account of these, in situ polymerized polymer electrolyte&#160;is proposed. Polymer solid electrolytes produced through in situ polymerization promote robust interface contact between the electrolyte and electrode while simplifying the preparation steps. This&#160;review&#160;summarized the latest research progress in in situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. These electrolytes were divided into three parts according to their polymerization methods: thermally induced polymerization, chemical initiator polymerization, ionizing radiation polymerization,&#160;and so on. Furthermore, we concluded the major challenges and future trends of in situ polymerized solid electrolytes for LMBs. It&#8217;s hoped that this review will provide meaningful guidance on designing high&#8208;performance polymer solid electrolytes for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Trance Amount of Ir Decorated NiFe Phosphide In&#8208;Situ Grown on Carbon Cloth as Cost&#8208;Effective Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post&#8208;treatment at a relative low temperature. The optimal electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, exhibits excellent OER activity, with an low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for alkaline OER, and a desirable long&#8208;term durability over 90 h. The outstanding OER performance stems from the structural evolution via phosphorization process, Ir decoration with more high&#8208;valence stated Ir4+ species, and tight connection between individual components of the electrode, which gives rise to the strong activity to the active sites and faster reaction kinetics in the alkaline OER process. Mover, the Ir loading was as low as approximately ~1.7 wt% (0.29 mg cm&#8208;2), showing promissing propective in cost&#8208;effective OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: On the Role of Local Charge Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular simulation models unravel the local charge profile of substrate&#8208;supported nanoparticles in contact to ionic liquid molecules &#8211; thus providing structural and electronic insights to nanosystems used in (electro&#8722;)catalyses. While quantum approaches are limited to comparably small systems, we demonstrate the application of the QEq method for bridging time and length scales significantly. This enables molecular simulation studies for exploring the self&#8208;organization of ionic liquid and reactant molecules on supported nanoparticle models.







Abstract
Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10&#8197;nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8722;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligands: Evaluating the Role of Acidic Protons in the Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ancillary NH groups contained within ligands can participate in reactions through metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. Substitution of the NH moiety by NMe or O can be used in the evaluation of its role. This study investigates how such substitutions also affect the electronics and the binding strengths of the ligand.







Abstract
To evaluate bifunctional ligand reactivity involving NH acidic sites in the secondary coordination sphere, complexes where the proton has been substituted with a methyl group (NMe) are often investigated. An alternative strategy involves substitution of the NH group for an O. This contribution considers and compares the merits of these approaches; the synthesis and characterization of cationic square&#8208;planar Rh carbonyl complexes bearing diprotic bispyrazole pyridine ligand L1, and the bis&#8208;methylated pyrazole pyridine ligand L1Me are described. The syntheses and characterization of the novel monoprotic pyrazole isoxazole pyridine ligand L2 and aprotic bisisoxazole pyridine ligand L3, and their corresponding Rh carbonyl complexes are also described. Comparison of the CO stretching frequencies of the four Rh complexes suggest that substitutions of NH with NMe, as well as with O, lead to significant electronic differences. These electronic differences result in different reactivities with respect to ligand addition/substitution of the Rh carbonyl complexes. Overall, the data suggest that electronic differences arising due to the NH substitutions can be significant and should be considered when the NH group is substituted in investigations of the participation of the NH proton in a reaction.

A Leishmania promastigote has immunologically important lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) on its surface and LPGs contain characteristic [&#8594;6)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Gal&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;Man&#8208;(1&#8208;PO3H] repeating units. In this study, the repeating structure was synthesized up to a triacontasaccharide derivative for the first&#8208;time using disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite derivative as a building block. The length of the product is comparable to that of a Leishmania promastigote LPGs.







Abstract
Lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) are found on the surface of Leishmania, a protozoan parasite, and are immunologically important. Herein, disaccharide 1&#8208;phosphate repeating units of LPGs were successfully synthesized on a solid support with high anomeric purity using a disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite building block. To enhance solubility in the reaction solvent, hydroxy&#8208;protecting groups in the form of para&#8208;t&#8208;butylbenzoyl were introduced to the building block. The saccharide chain was elongated via stable glycosyl boranophosphate linkages, followed by the conversion of inter&#8208;sugar linkages to phosphodiester counterparts using an oxaziridine derivative. The addition of a silylating reagent post&#8208;reaction with the oxaziridine derivative efficiently facilitated the conversion of boranophosohodiesters to phosphodiesters. This method enabled the &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of up to 15 repeating units, marking the longest homogeneous repeating units of LPGs synthesized chemically. Given the chain length equivalence to native LPGs, the method developed herein holds promise for advancing anti&#8208;Leishmanial pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleosidic diarylethenes was modified in three different ways by varying the connection between nucleoside and thiophene subunit with the aim of shifting the absorption wavelength of open (&#955;max,UV) and closed forms (&#955;max,Vis). A 5&#8208;uridine&#8208;2&#8208;thiophene connection (semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes) resulted in a red shift of &#955;max,UV and blue shift of &#955;max,Vis. Resulting switches showed remarkable reversibility and fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs&#8211;semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96&#8201;% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.

         <title>Tetrazole and Oxadiazole Derivatives as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties of six specially designed emitters for OLEDs, focusing on how structural variations like donor&#8208;acceptor distances and functional groups influence TADF efficiency. One standout emitter, TCz&#8208;CN, shows excellent performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter, demonstrating the potential for optimizing OLED properties through precise molecular design.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100&#8201;%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 1&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1, obtained from time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiment in PMMA matrix and quantum mechanical calculations, respectively. This comprehensive exploration identifies molecular bases of superior TADF emitters and provides insights for future designs, advancing the optimization of TADF properties in OLEDs.

This study investigates the ability of the carbonaceous meteorite CV3 Allende to act as a catalyst in electrochemical interactions, triggering electrocatalytic reactions resulting in nitrogen (N2) fixation and conversion to ammonia. Additionally, the evolution of crucial compounds such as H2, CN&#8722; and sulfur/H2S was observed, along with the detection of potential reagent carriers suggesting significant implications not only for Strecker synthesis and aminoacid production under space conditions but also for Panspermia theories and the study of prebiotic chemistry in early Earth.







Abstract
This study explores the electrochemical properties of the carbonaceous Allende CV3 meteorite, focusing on its potential as a Fe&#8208;based catalyst derived from Mackinawite iron sulfide for electrocatalytic reactions facilitating nitrogen (N2) fixation into ammonia. Through comprehensive analysis, we not only monitored the evolution of key compounds such as CN&#8208;, sulfur/H2S, H2 and carbonyl compounds, but also identified potential reagent carriers, indicating significant implications for the Strecker synthesis of amino acids in space environments. Initial examination revealed the presence of polypeptides, notably sequences including dimer Ala&#8208;&#945;&#8208;HO&#8208;Gly, pentamer Gly3&#8208;Ala2, and hexamer Gly4&#8208;(HO&#8208;Gly)2. These discoveries greatly enhance our understanding of astrobiological chemistry, offering valuable insights into prebiotic processes and the potential presence of life&#8208;building blocks throughout the universe.

         <title>Structural Deformations in Cucurbit[n]urils: Analysis, Host&#8208;Guest Dependence, and Automated Ellipticity Measurements Using ElliptiCB[n]</title>

We report development and use of ElliptiCB[n], which provides automated measurements of cucurbituril ellipticities. We also include a detailed analysis of all prior crystallographically characterized CB[5,6,7,8,10] hosts







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are cyclic macrocycles with rich host&#8208;guest chemistry. In many cases, guest binding in CB[n]s results in host structural deformations. Unfortunately, measuring such deformations remains a major challenge, with only a handful of manual estimations reported in the literature. To address this challenge, we have developed the public program ElliptiCB[n], which is available on GitHub, that provides a robust and automated method for measuring the elliptical deformations in CB[n] hosts. We outline the development and validation of this approach, apply ElliptiCB[n] to measure the ellipticity of the 1113 available CB[n] structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and directly investigate the structural deformations of CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10] hosts. We also report the general landscape of accessible CB[n] elliptical deformations and compare ellipticity distributions across CB[n] hosts and host&#8208;guest complexes. We found that in almost all cases guest binding significantly impacts the distribution of host ellipticity distributions and that these distributions are dissimilar across host&#8208;guest complexes of differently sized CB[n]s. We anticipate that this work will provide a useful approach for understanding of the flexibility of CB[n] hosts and will also enable future measurement and standardization of ellipticity measurements of CB[n]s.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Active Lone Pairs Induced Second Harmonic Generation Responses and Electrocatalytic Activity in Hybrid Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid material, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8901;H2O was successfully synthesized. Both theoretical analysis and experimental data have confirmed the crucial role of the 4s lone pair electrons of the Ge atom in inducing SHG response and electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable s2 lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis. While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional material incorporating Ge with 4s2 lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8208;H2O (MeHDabco=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1). Driven by the stereochemically active lone pair electrons on the Ge2+, 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21 at room temperature and exhibits good second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Interestingly, 1 also shows electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the existence of lone pair electrons on Ge2+ cations. The electrochemical experiment combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the lone pair electrons act as both an active site for proton adsorption and facilitate the ionization of water. This work not only emphasizes the important role of lone pair electrons in material properties and functions but also provides new insight for designing novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid materials.

         <title>What Determines the Lewis Acidity of a Bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;Based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures and reactivities of (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiX2 (X=Cl, I, C2F5) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. It turned out that the construction of functional Lewis acidic sites based on neutral bismuthanes requires substituents with a high ionic character and electronegativity, and at the same time they should not contain atoms in &#945;&#8208;position or lone pairs that are capable of undergoing effective negative hyperconjugation.







Abstract
Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8722;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital.

         <title>N&#8208;Halosuccinimide&#8208;CeCl3 Transient Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes as Semi Heterogeneous Photocatalyst in Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>

In this work, photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride formed a transient charge&#8208;transfer complex with NXS (X=Br, I) in acetonitrile, acting as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. This facilitated Ce(III) ion light absorption, creating halide radicals that converted N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes. Experiments confirmed a single electron transfer pathway. The CeCl3 was reusable with minimal decomposition.







Abstract
In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesize new push&#8211;pull compounds characterized by naphthalimide as electron acceptor and by different electron donors such as tetraphenylethylene, triphenylamine and phenothiazine. Our time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic results show that TADF is occurring in the yellow and orange&#8211;red ranges of the visible. Fluorescence quantum yields are surprisingly large, triggered by the conjugation enhancement achieved through the synthetic effort.







Abstract
In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film. The weight of the Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) is greatly enhanced when these fluorophores are used as guests in solid&#8211;state host matrices. TADF is interestingly revealed in the orange&#8211;red region of the visible. Such long wavelength emission is here observed with surprisingly large fluorescence quantum yields, thanks to the conjugation enhancement achieved in these newly synthesized structures relative to previous studies. Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.

A mild and facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite leading to organic nitrate esters has been developed at room temperature in air. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds smoothly to afford the corresponding organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air the green oxidant.







Abstract
A simple and efficient strategy has been developed for the synthesis of organic nitrate esters via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite under open air atmosphere. This transformation could be conducted under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions to provide a number of organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air as the green oxidant.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Chemically Programmed Amphiphiles into Aqueous Nanotubes with a Lipophilic Lumen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel nanotubes of ca. 4&#8197;nm in diameter self&#8208;assembled in water from custom&#8208;tailored amphiphiles are able to selectively encapsulate apolar molecules within their lipophilic lumen.







Abstract
The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.

A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composite material (MZT) adsorbent for V(V) adsorption. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole and enhanced natural photocatalytic degradation Rhodamine B. The study proposes a resourceful, effective method for repurposing waste via natural photocatalytic reactions leveraging clean energy, potentially contributing to environmental preservation and presenting innovative avenues for spent adsorbent recovery.







Abstract
Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, yielding up to 89.7&#8201;%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3&#8201;% and 97.4&#8201;% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251&#8197;nm and 561&#8197;nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.

A novel series of vinylene bridged heteroaryls is presented and studied by computational methods. Calculated structural and optoelectronic properties are discussed in order to identify viable molecular designs. Notably, one candidate exhibits a narrow band gap, longer absorption wavelengths, low BLA and reorganization energy. These findings suggest its potential use as a precursor of advanced conjugated materials for organic electronics.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers are of great importance for the fabrication of organic photonic and electronic devices. To this end, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers need to meet both optoelectronic and key structural properties in order to fulfill their implementation as active components. In particular, they need to possess low bandgap and high thermal, conformational, and photochemical stabilities. So far, several strategies have been developed to attain such requirements including the covalent and non&#8208;covalent rigidification concepts of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. On the basis of these findings, we describe herein the theoretical studies of novel series of covalently bridged derivatives demonstrating the benefits of the strategy. Comparison of these derivatives with compounds previously described in the literature highlights enhanced optoelectronic properties and behaviors that would be beneficial for the construction and development of new linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.

(&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers are prepared as a new motif from tosylate 3. The motif has a preferred &#8216;propellar&#8217; conformation which can adopt left or right handed twists. LogP's are lower than tert&#8208;butyl analogues. Interactions between TFNP groups in the solid state are shown to also anchor supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
A route is developed to (&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8722;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their neopentyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is reported. The design concept is based on merging of cyanostilbenes with guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrroles yielding hybrid luminophores, capable to undergo photoisomerization and are able to be used in biomedical imaging.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Crystalline Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Surfactant Complex with Chiral Supramolecular Structure and Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal with a helical structure and tunable CPL was fabricated by a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation. This material exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and a helical structure without inherent chirality. Chiral solvation imparts TPE&#8208;DHAB with a preferred handedness, enabling tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) when using a chiral solvent.







Abstract
A novel room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal of tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;DHAB) was synthesized using an ionic self&#8208;assembly strategy. The TPE&#8208;DHAB complex exhibits typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties and a unique helical supramolecular structure. Moreover, the generation and handedness inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) can be achieved through further chiral solvation, providing a facile approach to fabricate room&#8208;temperature liquid crystalline materials with controllable supramolecular structures and tunable CPL properties through a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation process.

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium incorporation onto already electron&#8208;deficient benzene diimides is demonstrated here. In the solid state, these compounds engage in interesting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions and H&#8722;bonding patterns. Injection of electrons is facile (ca. &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) and results in species with NIR absorption maxima (&#955;max up to 821&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8211;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8211;water H&#8722;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.

A new sustainable method for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;N,S&#8208;heterocycles, including 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;imines and 4,5&#8208;dihydrothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines is reported. This innovative approach offers considerable shorter reaction times with higher yields, reduced energy consumption, and the elimination of hazardous chemicals. Moreover, the process is scalable, as demonstrated by the reaction conducted on a 10&#8197;mmol scale. This method represents a significant advancement in producing pharmacologically relevant compounds.







Abstract
This study introduces a sustainable and pioneering cascade synthesis of 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine derivatives under eco&#8208;friendly conditions. The methodology transcends traditional approaches yielding complex novel compounds with unique N,S&#8208;heterocyclic structures. By operating at room temperature, utilizing green solvents, and minimizing excess of reactants, this procedure offers an innovative pathway for sustainable chemical development. Notably, this method not only prioritizes sustainability but also delivers high&#8208;purity products with exceptional yields. The simplicity of the process, requiring only a simple filtration and featuring short reaction times, underscores its efficiency and utility.

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple model to explain the preferred geometry for tricoordinate pnictogen pincer complexes is proposed based on competing &#960; and &#963; effects to make sense of the variable structures reported in the literature. This model is supported by density functional theory calculations of more than 1300 structures, determining the energy of 64 compounds spanning geometries from planar to pyramidal.







Abstract
Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Oxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides and oxamates yields N&#8208;aryloxamates in moderate to excellent yields, especially when oxamates bear bulky tertiary alkyl groups. These oxamates are hydrolyzed to oxamic acids, then converted into urethanes using PIDA or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.

This study dives into the electrochemical secrets of the Allende CV3 meteorite, checking out its potential as a Fe&#8208;based catalyst from Mackinawite iron sulfide to turn nitrogen into ammonia. Along the way, we found compounds like CN&#8722;, sulfur/H2S, H2, and carbonyls, and even discovered polypeptides like Gly3. These findings suggest that space rocks might be busy cooking up amino acids, giving us a cosmic clue about how life's building blocks might be scattered across the universe. More information can be found in the Research Article by W. Sch&#246;fberger and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401856).

Metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk phases of ionic liquids are within reach of molecular dynamics simulations. In their Concept (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402036), S. Trzeciak and D. Zahn discuss the charge equilibration (QEq) method for dynamically adjusting atom&#8208;centred partial charges to model changes in local environments. Insights encompass the effect of molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltages&#8212;thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8208;)catalysis from molecular modelling.

         <title>Gene Editing with Artificial DNA Scissors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial metallonucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic agent. This review introduces concepts core to this area such as DNA structure, AMN design, and cleavage mechanisms. We also describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities.

Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as DNA molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic with high clinical potential. This review provides a primary level of exploration on the concepts key to this area including an introduction to DNA structure, function, recognition, along with damage and repair mechanisms. Building on this foundation, we describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide molecular scissors with enhanced or sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities. As this research field continues to evolve, understanding the applications of AMNs along with synthetic conjugation strategies can provide the basis for future innovations, particularly for designing new artificial gene editing systems.

Electrochemistry and photochemistry join forces in the booming field of electrophotocatalysis. Electrophotocatalytic activation is suitable to engage even previously inaccessible compounds in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herin we provide an overview of recent developments in this field.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) has evolved as a new scientific discipline around the boundary of highly active fields: electrochemistry and photocatalysis. EPC allows us to combine the energy of light and electric potential to activate previously inaccessible compounds via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Herein, we review the most essential applications of EPC to the C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules. This work discusses mechanisms that can be encountered when designing such processes and analyzes technical aspects of performing EPC reactions in the laboratory.

Since the synthesis of heptacene in 2006, the race to obtain and study the properties of largest acenes resulted in the development of innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to on&#8208;surface chemistry. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of large acenes, up to tridecacene, highlighting the newest studies.







Abstract
Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of large acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 57, October 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural parameters are known to govern covalent polymer mechanochemistry, but the complexity increases when chemically different chains are linked by covalent bonds, as in block copolymers (BCPs). This review highlights studies trying to define structure&#8208;activity relationship in the mechanochemistry of BCPs in various states, with an emphasis on the influence of their morphologies.







Abstract
Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8722;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.

         <title>Electrodeposition and optimisation of amorphous NixSy catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyser has shown its potential in green hydrogen production. One of the crucial tasks is discover novel cost&#8208;effective and sustainable electrocatalyst materials. In this study, a low&#8208;cost Ni&#8208;S&#8208;based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction was prepared via a simple electrodeposition process from a modified Watts bath recipe. Physical characterisation methods suggest this deposit film to be amorphous. Optimisation of the electrodeposition parameters of the NixSy catalyst was carried out using a rotating disk electrode setup. The optimised catalyst exhibited excellent catalytical performance in 1 M KOH on a microelectrode, with overpotentials of 41 mV, 111 mV and 202 mV at 10, 100 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 67.9 mV dec&#8208;1 recorded at 333 K. Long&#8208;term testing of the catalyst demonstrated steady performance over a 24 h period on microelectrode at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 with only 71 mV and 37 mV overpotential increase at 293 K and 333 K respectively. Full cell testing with the optimised NixSy as cathode and NiFe(OH&#173;)2 as anode showed 1.88 V after 1 h electrolysis at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 in 1 M KOH under 333 K with FAA&#8208;3&#8208;30 membrane.</dc:description>

The precursor molar ratio affects the extent of pentadienyl C&#8211;H&#8208;bond activation and oligomerization to tetra&#8208; and pentametallic arrays. Reacting a 1:2:2 mixture at &#8211;40 &#176;C gave the open sandwich methyl complex (2,4&#8208;dtbp)2Lu(CH3), displaying a vital intermediate for subsequent ring&#8208;closure reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromatic Natural Terpenes as Unusual &#8220;Slingshot&#8221; Antioxidants with Promising Ferroptosis Inhibition Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism based on extensive cellular membrane peroxidation, implicated in neurodegenerative and other diseases. The essential oil component &#947;&#8208;terpinene, a natural monoterpene with a unique highly oxidizable pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene skeleton, inhibits peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipid in model heterogeneous systems (micelles and liposomes). Upon H&#8208;atom abstraction, an unstable &#947;&#8208;terpinene&#8208;derived peroxyl radical is formed, that aromatizes to p&#8208;cymene generating HOO&#8226; radicals. As HOO&#8226; are small and hydrophilic radicals, they quickly diffuse outside the lipid core, blocking the radical chain propagation of polyunsaturated lipids. This unprecedented antioxidant &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism explains why &#947;&#8208;terpinene shows a protective activity against ferroptosis, being effective at submicromolar concentrations in human neuroblastoma (SH&#8208;SY5Y) cells</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Chemical and Structural Complexity of Aluminum Hydroxy Acetates: from Commodity Chemicals to Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum acetates have been in use for more than a century, but despite their widespread commercial applications, essential scientific knowledge of their synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships is lacking. High&#8208;throughput screening, followed by fine tuning and extensive optimization of reaction conditions using Al3+, OH&#8208; and CH3COO&#8208; ions, has unraveled their complex synthetic chemistry, yielding for the first time the four phase pure products Al(OH)(O2CCH3) &#8901; x H2O (x = 0, 2) (1A and CAU&#8208;65, 1B), Al3O(HO2CCH3)(O2CCH3)7 (2), and the porous aluminum salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12](OH)4 (CAU&#8208;55&#8208;OH, 3). Structure determination by electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction was carried out and the data suggested porosity for 1B and 3, which was confirmed by physisorption experiments. Even the scale&#8208;up to the 10 L scale was accomplished for 1A, 1B and 3 with yields of up to 1.1 kg (99%). This study of a seemingly simple chemical system provides important information on both fundamental inorganic chemistry and porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Cleavage of Double&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) to Single&#8208;Stranded DELs with Compounds at the 3' End: Its Application in Photo&#8208;crosslinking Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology is a crucial tool in pharmaceutical research, rapidly identifying compounds that bind to a target of interest from an extensive pool of compounds. In this study, we propose a new method for generating single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end. The introduction of uniquely designed hairpin&#8208;shaped headpieces containing deoxyuridine (NC&#8208;HP) and the use of a cleavage enzyme facilitate the conversion from double&#8208;stranded DELs (dsDELs) to such ssDELs. Moreover, Klenow fill&#8208;in provides the dsDELs with photo&#8208;crosslinkers covalently linked to the coding region, which exhibit durability even under stringent washing conditions and enable photo&#8208;crosslinking with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, as also confirmed in cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking selections.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Isomeric Co&#8208;CPs for Luminescence Recognition and Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Co&#8208;based supramolecular isomers were synthesized from a fluorinated carboxylic acid ligand under hydrothermal conditions at varying temperatures. Both exhibited similar one&#8208;dimensional chain structures while different bending connections of the aromatic rings led to different supramolecular structures, namely CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2, respectively. The structural differences of two isomers resulted in discrepant performance with regards to luminescence sensing and catalysis. CoCP&#8208;1 demonstrated more significant luminescence quenching activity toward biomarkers 2,6&#8208;dipyridinoic acid (DPA) and high vanilloid acid (HVA), which could be distinguished in the presence of Eu3+. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 3.4 and 1.3 &#956;M, respectively. The recovery rate of for HVA and DPA was within the range of 89.6&#8208;101.2% and 99.7&#8208;117.9% in simulated urine and serum, respectively, indicating potential reliability in monitoring these two analytes in real samples. Notably, CoCP&#8208;2 exhibited catalytic activity for the oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Our finding here suggests that the coordination conformation of the ligands within supramolecular isomers plays a pivotal role in determining the structure and luminescence sensing/catalysis performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Design and Self&#8208;assembly of pH&#8208;Responsive Multidomain Peptides Incorporating Non&#8208;natural&#160;Ionic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides, particularly pH&#8208;responsive variants, hold significant promise in biomedical and technological applications by leveraging the broad pH spectrum inherent to biological environments. However, the limited number of natural pH&#8208;responsive amino acids within biologically relevant pH ranges presents challenges for designing rational pH&#8208;responsive peptide assemblies. In our study, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating a library of non&#8208;natural amino acids featuring chemically diverse tertiary amine side chains. Hydrophobic and ionic properties of these non&#8208;natural amino acids facilitate their incorporation into the assembly domain when uncharged, and electrostatic repulsion promotes disassembly under lower pH conditions. Furthermore, we observed a direct relationship between the number of substitutions and the hydrophobicity of these amino acids, influencing their pH&#8208;responsive properties and enabling rational design based on desired transitional pH ranges. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of these pH&#8208;responsive peptides was evaluated by assessing their antimicrobial properties, as their antimicrobial activity is triggered by the disassembly of peptides to release active monomers. This approach not only enhances the specificity and controllability of pH responsiveness but also broadens the scope of peptide materials in biomedical and technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Aromatic Substitution: A Study on Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic substitution of redox&#8208;active aromatic compounds could be initiated by a preceding redox step. We report on the different reaction pathways of such redox&#8208;induced substitution (RIAS) reactions between a redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecule (GFA) and an amine or guanidine. Oxidation of the GFA leads to an umpolung of the guanidine from a nucleophile to an electrophile and thereby enables addition of the amine or guanidine. Several examples are given, demonstrating the use of redox substitution in synthetic chemistry, e.g. for the convenient synthesis of novel N&#8208;heteropolycyclic molecules and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Fortuitous Enantiomeric Self&#8208;Rectification of an Unreported Partial Racemisation in the Synthesis of a Chiral Phosphoric Acid: A Warning to Practitioners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Racemisation without Consequence: MOM deprotection of an ether intermediate during a routine synthesis of phosphoric acid 1 promoted partial racemisation of the product BINOL 5. Surprisingly, however, after phosphorylation of the partially racemised BINOL, enantiopure acid 1 was isolated. Further inspection revealed that during phosphorylation, unhydrolysed racemic phosphorochloridate 6 precipitated, thus restoring homochirality in the product phosphoric acid 1. Moreover, MOM deprotection partial racemisation was avoided by conducting reactions at lower temperatures for no longer than the required deprotection time, and/or by application of other deprotection conditions from the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>IPLOT&#8208;VKA: an Integral&#8208;method Powell&#8208;pLOT&#8208;enhanced Visual Kinetic Analysis for the Determination of Orders of Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determination of partial orders of reactions in kinetics is a general entry step for any mechanistic investigation; recently, considerable attention has been given to the benefits of using visual methods to help in this task, such as easy utilization and data&#8208;efficiency. In this respect, we here revisit and improve the classic method by Powell and Margerison for kinetic analysis. For the first time, analytical equations for a bimolecular reaction have been worked out for all values of partial orders of reactions, and the solutions have been implemented in a free, open&#8208;access and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use Web&#8208;application, named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, which also allows estimation of the errors on the kinetic constant, and residual standard error on concentrations. Several examples, taken from reference teaching experiences and from recent literature in catalysis show the efficacy and accuracy of our approach, which also has the advantage of requiring less experimental runs than other visual methods currently available.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Transformations of Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: Polymorphs and Coformer Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations of solid samples under solvent&#8208;free or minimal solvent conditions set the future trend and define a modern strategy for the production of new materials. Of the various technologies tested in recent years, the mechanochemical approach seems to be the most promising.&#160;The aim of this review article is to present the current state of art in solid state research on binary systems, which have found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical and materials science industries. This article is divided into three sections. In the first part, we describe the new equipment improvements.&#160;A brief description of techniques dedicated to ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ studies of progress and the mechanism of solid matter transformation&#160; is presented. In the second section, we discuss the problem of cocrystal polymorphism highlighting the issue related with correlation between mechanochemical parameters (time, temperature, energy, molar ratio,&#160;liquid assistant, surface energy, crystal size, crystal shape) and preference for the formation of requested polymorph. The last part is devoted to the description of the processes of coformer exchange in binary systems forced by mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The influence of the thermodynamic factor on the selection of the best&#8208;suited partner for the formation of a two&#8208;component&#160; structure is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Titanate Perovskites in the Oxidation of Amines to Imines via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering that structural differences could affect the photocatalytic efficiency of titanate perovskites, cubic SrTiO3 (STO) and tetragonal CaTiO3 (CTO) were synthesised as models to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. STO and CTO materials were produced through hydrothermal approaches, adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to optimise material purity. Among the perovskite photocatalysts, two stand out for their exceptional photocatalytic capacity and crystalline purity: CaTiO3, prepared at 180 &#186;C for 36 h, and SrTiO3, synthesised at 200 &#186;C for 24 h. Notably, we explore the selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine (BZA) to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BZI), with CaTiO3 emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction. The CTO material prepared at 180 &#186;C for 36 h (CTO180T&#8208;36) achieved a peak BZI production of 0.5 mM, with a total conversion of BZA after 7 h of irradiation. This study also emphasises the crucial role of reaction conditions and perovskite morphologies in fine&#8208;tuning photocatalytic performance. These findings highlight opportunities for developing efficient and selective photocatalytic processes, holding the compromise for applications in organic synthesis and sustainable green chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering interfacial molecular interactions on Ag Hollow fibre gas diffusion electrodes for high efficiency in CO2 conversion to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface of the flow&#8208;through Ag&#8208;based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple&#8208;phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long&#8208;alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB&#8208;containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95 % in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization by Intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring systems of all sizes are frequent core or substructures in natural products and they are important elements of many drug molecules, as they often confer high binding affinity to and selectivity for disease&#8208;relevant biological targets. A uniform key transformation in the synthesis of such structures is the cyclization step. Among the various approaches that have been developed for ring closure, the intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction has emerged as a powerful option for the construction of normal&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized rings as well as macrocycles, due to its stereospecificity, the mild reaction conditions, and the non&#8208;toxic nature of the boron by&#8208;products. In this review, we summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of the application of intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in the construction of (macro)cyclic frameworks of natural products and bioactive molecules of synthetic origin, covering (mostly) examples that have been reported since 2015. Target molecules prepared via intramolecular Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling as a key step range from natural products / natural product analogs to synthetic drug candidates, featuring ring sizes from 4 to &gt;&gt;12. We highlight the utility, scope, and limitations of the reaction for different ring sizes and arrays of functional groups. Where possible, comparisons with other methods of cyclization are provided.</dc:description>

Where possible, comparisons with other methods of cyclization are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toughening Healable Supramolecular Double Polymer Networks Based on Hydrogen Bonding and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double polymer networks (DNs) consist of two interpenetrating polymer networks and can offer properties that are not merely a sum of the parts. Here, we report an elastic DN made from two supramolecular polymers (SMPs) that consist of the same poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (BA) backbone. The two polymers feature different non&#8208;covalent binding motifs, which form dynamic, reversible cross&#8208;links. The polymers were prepared by reversible addi&#173;ti&#173;on&#8722;frag&#173;mentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate and either the self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyri&#173;mi&#173;dinone, or the 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#173;benz&#173;&#173;imidazolyl)&#173;pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre&#8208;stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links and their orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsive&#173;ness.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented cubic mesomorphic behaviour of crown&#8208;ether functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic supramolecular materials based on biodegradable cyclodextrins (CDs) have been known to self&#8208;assemble into different types of thermotropic liquid crystals, including smectic and hexagonal columnar mesophases. Previous studies on amphiphilic CDs bearing 14 aliphatic chains at the primary face and 7 oligoethylene glycol (OEG) chains at the secondary face showed that the stability of the mesophase can be rationally tuned through implemation of terminal functional groups to the OEG chains. Here, we report the syntheses of first examples of crown ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins that unexpectedly form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic phases. This constitutes the first reported examples of cyclodextrins forming such phases, which are potentially capable of 3D ion transport. Lithium composites were made to assess lithium conduction in the material. XRD revealed the added lithium salt destabilizes the cubic phase in favour of the smectic phase. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies showed that these materials conduct lithium ions with a very low activation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Aromatic C&#8722;O Linkages by Oxoammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;O bond is important to the conversion of biomass and plastic wastes into value&#8208;added chemicals. Here we put forward the oxidative cleavage of para&#8208;C&#8211;O bonds in phenolic compounds in use of oxoammonium salts as oxidant and water as the oxygen source. The mechanism is that oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct and thus realizes the ipso&#8208;substitution of 4&#8208;alkoxyphenol, which is proved by substituent effect, isotope labelling experiments, and kinetic analysis. Furthermore, this protocol is successfully applied into the depolymerization of both lignin model compounds with &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;5 and 4&#8208;O&#8208;5 linkages and polyphenylene oxide (PPO).</dc:description>
