         <title>Push&#8211;Pull Bridged Distyrylbenzene with Highly Bright Solid&#8208;State Red&#8208;Orange Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple emission colors in solid&#8208;state organic fluorophores with the same main skeleton are essential for improving the performance of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials. Specifically, emission in the red/near&#8208;infrared region is of great importance in the biological field. Previously, we developed di&#8208;bridged&#8208;distyrylbenzene DBDB[7] with high&#8208;brightness solid&#8208;state blue and aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) by introducing the bridging structures of a seven&#8208;membered ring into the vinylene groups of distyrylbenzene (DSB). Herein, we synthesize MNDSDMeOB[7] (1), which features substituted methoxy and malononitrile groups as donor and acceptor groups, respectively, in DBDB[7]. In solvents more polar than THF, MNDSDMeOB (3), which has the same main skeleton as 1 but without bridges, shows no emission in the solid state, whereas 1 exhibits highly bright red&#8208;orange emission in the solid state owing to the suppression of intermolecular electronic interactions by the bridges and the AIE property. We also synthesize MNDSD(EHO)B (2) in which the methoxy groups of 3 are replaced by ethylhexyloxy groups, thus disrupting the crystallinity of the molecule. 2 exhibits positive fluorescence solvatochromism and has a high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state as a red&#8208;emitting DSB derivative. The solid&#8208;state emission properties of 1 and 2 will improve the applicability of DSBs and functionalities of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A pyramidal metal organic frameworks&#8208;derived FeP@CoP aluminium&#8208;ion battery cathode displaying low&#8208;temperature tolerance and fast electron transfer kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite is developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode remains a high capacity of 168 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8210;10 &#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.3 A g&#8208;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. Those findings would inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Perylene Bisimide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, perylene bisimide gels are prepared that can exhibit the photothermal effect. This can be used for example to heat a solution above the gel.







Abstract
Gels formed using a perylene bisimide (PBI) as a low molecular weight gelator can show the photothermal effect. Formation of the PBI radical anion results in new absorption bands forming, meaning that subsequent irradiation with a wavelength of light overlapping with the new absorption band leads to heating of the gel. This approach can be used to heat the gel, as well as the surrounding milieu. We show how we can use electrochemical methods as well as multicomponent systems to form the radical anion without the need for UV light, and how we can use the photothermal effect to induce phase transitions in the solutions above the gels by exploiting photothermal behavior.

         <title>Deciphering the Differences in Ambident Reactivity between the Cyanate, Thiocyanate Ions, and their P&#8208; and As&#8208;Containing Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the ambident nature of the [NCX]&#8722; (X&#8201;:&#8201;O, S, Se) anions is well known, the analogous heavier P&#8208; or As&#8208;containing species are lesser explored. This computational study explores the ambident SN2 reactivities of all existing [ECX]&#8722; (E: N, P, As; X: O, S, Se) anions. The results conceptualise reactivity patterns and offer explanations on the trends so that the accessibility of unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate organopnictogen species can be proposed.







Abstract
Although the cyanate and thiocyanate anions belong to the most known textbook examples of ambident nucleophiles, the electronic factors that determine their markedly differing reactivities are still unclear. The recently discovered P&#8208; and As&#8208;containing [PCX]&#8722; and [AsCX]&#8722; analogues (X: O, S, Se), whose ambident nature is practically unexplored, may serve as ideal basis for comparison to clarify these differences. This study presents comprehensive theoretical investigations on the nucleophilic behaviours of the whole set of so far known [ECX]&#8722; (E: N, P, As, X: O, S, Se) anions, aiming for a systematic understanding of the reactivity patterns and identifying the factors that govern the nucleophilic substitutions. The results indicate that the SN2 reactions of the O&#8208;containing [ECO]&#8722; ions are thermodynamically preferred at the pnictogen centres E, while the kinetic contributions are only substantial for the N&#8208;containing [NCX]&#8722; anions. The ambident reactivities of the congeners that contain N or O significantly differ from those with P, As, S, or Se heteroatoms, in line with the inert s&#8208;orbital effect, characteristic for the heavier elements. By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, clear explanations are offered for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&#8722; anions. To serve for synthetic investigations, possible outcomes of nucleophilic substitutions are predicted, and the target molecules are expected to be versatile and useful synthons.

         <title>Using Solution History to Control Hydrogel Properties of a Perylene Bisimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelation: We demonstrate how one perylene bisimides gelator and one gelation trigger can form different hydrogels with different mechanical and optical properties. This is done by altering the starting pH and the history of the solution before it is gelled. This demonstrates the tunability of a single molecule using the same gelation conditions is possible, which is valuable in material design.







Abstract
pH dependence on water soluble aggregates is well&#8208;known in the field of low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), with different aggregates sometimes having very different properties depending on their final pH. This aggregation determines their applications and performance. Here, we investigate the pH dependence of perylene bisimide gels; initially solutions are formed at a high pH and gels form as the pH is decreased. We find it is not only the final pH but also the starting pH that can impact the resulting gel. We use small angle neutron scattering (SANS), rheology, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy to examine the effect of starting pH on gelation kinetics and final gel properties. Adjusting the solution from pH&#8197;9 (where there are few or no aggregates) to pH&#8197;6 results in the formation of different worm&#8208;like micelles than the ones directly formed at pH&#8197;6, leading to again gels with different mechanical properties. This work highlights the importance of controlling the pH of solutions before gelation, but also opens up more possible morphologies and therefore more properties from the same molecule.

         <title>Polarity and Dielectric Property Control Triggered by a Coordinated Solvent Molecule Exchange in Luminescent Mononuclear Aluminium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first example of solvent vapour&#8208;induced polarity and dielectric property switching, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, has been demonstrated in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit strong green emission in the solid state. In this system, the coordinated solvent substitution is the &#8220;trigger&#8221; for the corresponding structural rearrangements.







Abstract
The development of molecule&#8208;based multifunctional switchable materials that exhibit a switch of polarity and dielectric property are extremely limited. We have demonstrated solvent&#8208;vapour&#8208;induced reversible molecular rearrangements between nonpolar crystals [Al(sap)(acac)(sol)] (H2sap=2&#8208;salicylideneaminophenol, acac=acetylacetonate, sol=MeOH (1), EtOH (2)) and polar crystal [Al(sap)(acac)(DMSO)] (3). This crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal structural transformation was accompanied by a switch of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric properties, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, thus reflecting the SHG&#8208;active polar Cc space group of 3. This is the first reported example of dielectric properties and polarity switching in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit strong green emission in the solid state.

         <title>Preparation of UFM1&#8208;Derived Probes through Highly Optimized Total Chemical Synthesis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A total chemical synthesis strategy utilizing UFM1&#8197;C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide as a versatile handle is reported for the facile preparation of UFM1&#8208;derived probes. This approach allows the convenient installation of electrophilic warheads, fluorescent reporters and unnatural purification tags onto the UFM1 sequence.







Abstract
Ufmylation is involved in various cellular processes and associated with many human diseases. The understanding of this modification relies on the use of customized UFM1&#8208;derived probes for activity&#8208;based profiling of its related enzymes. This study presents a highly optimized total chemical synthesis for the generation of diverse UFM1&#8208;derived probes including UFM1&#8208;PA, Biotin&#8208;UFM1&#8208;PA and UFM1&#8208;AMC, in which a UFM1&#8197;C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide was readily prepared by hydrazide&#8208;based ligation and used as a versatile handle for the installation of enzyme&#8208;sensitive warheads and fluorescent reporters. The resulting probes display high reactivity and selectivity for UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes in cell lysates. This strategy facilitates the generation and diversity of the UFM1&#8208;derived toolkit that can be employed to profile UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes, thereby shining insights into the dynamics of ufmylation.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical C&#8722;N Coupling of Amides with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl halides with amides using NiCl2&#8208;bipyridine complex as a pre&#8208;catalyst in the absence of an external photocatalyst is reported, allowing a broad array of aryl chlorides to be converted into the corresponding (hetero)arylamides.







Abstract
This paper reports a photochemical C&#8722;N coupling of abundant, but less reactive aryl chlorides, with structurally diverse primary and secondary amides by Ni&#8208;mediated without an external photocatalyst. Under the irradiation of light (390&#8211;395&#8197;nm) with a soluble organic amine as the base, the reaction allows for the successful transformation of (hetero)aryl chlorides to a wide range of N&#8208;aryl amides. More than 60&#8197;examples are shown, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of this protocol in organic synthesis. Mechanic studies indicate that this amidation proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(III) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Formate Additive for Efficient and Stable Methylammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells by Gas&#8208;Quenching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formate addtives play a critical role in regulating the crystal growth and orientation of MA&#8208;free perovskite films prepared with gas&#8208;quenching. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94&#8201;% and improved stability without any interfacial passivation.







Abstract
In order to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, gas&#8208;quenching is considered to be a promising technique for perovskite film fabrication. However, when handling with methylammonium&#8208;free (MA&#8208;free) perovskites, it is often difficult to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films by gas&#8208;quenching. Herein, formate additives are employed to regulate the crystallization of MA&#8208;free perovskite, and improve the quality of perovskite films. Different additives of formamidine formate (FAFO) and potassium formate (KFO) is compared to investigate the role of formate groups in the crystallization of perovskite films prepared by gas&#8208;quenching. The FAFO additive facilitates the perovskite crystallization in (001) orientation whereas KFO favors for (111) orientation. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94&#8201;%, compared to that of 20.14&#8201;% for KFO devices. In addition, FAFO device also exhibits improved thermal stability in ambient condition without encapsulation, extending the T80 lifetime by 18&#8197;times compared to the pristine device.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;, Temperature&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly: Merocyanine Dimerization as a Showcase Example for Obtaining Reliable Thermodynamic Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparative UV/Vis absorption studies illustrate the importance to mind the assumptions behind temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent data evaluation to obtain thermodynamic parameters for self&#8208;assembly processes with the same reliability as from classical concentration&#8208;dependent studies.







Abstract
Mathematical models for the concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent analysis of self&#8208;assembly equilibria are derived for the most simple case of dimer formation, to highlight the assumptions these models and the thus determined thermodynamic parameters are based on. The three models were applied to UV/Vis absorption data for the dimerization of a highly dipolar merocyanine dye in 1,4&#8208;dioxane. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) dilution experiments were performed as an independent reference technique. While the concentration&#8208;dependent analysis is according to our studies the most reliable method, also the less time&#8208;consuming temperature&#8208;dependent evaluation can give accurate results in the present example, despite small thermochromic effects. In contrast, the strong negative solvatochromism of the merocyanine tampers with the results from the solvent&#8208;dependent evaluation. Even though the studies presented in this work are limited to the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of a dipolar dye, the basic principles can be transferred to other chromophores and different self&#8208;assembly models, including those for supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Co2+ Doped Biotinylated Carbon Dot: A Theranostic Agent for Target Specific Killing of Cancer Cells via Hypoxia Induced Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting cancer cells: Biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) selectively diagnosed and killed cancer cells with marked superiority over normal cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay confirmed the increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) that has key role in hypoxia generation leading to apoptosis. In 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis.







Abstract
Conventional cancer treatments have systematic side effects that stand against its desirable therapeutic efficacy. Alternative strategies using biochemical features of cancer cells to promote apoptosis are finding notable significance. One such important biochemical feature of malignant cells is hypoxia, alteration of which can lead to cell death. Hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) has the key role in hypoxia generation. Herein, we synthesized biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) that specifically diagnose and selectively killed cancer cells with 3&#8211;3.1&#8208;fold higher efficiency over non&#8208;cancer cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay in CoCDb treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cells confirmed the increased expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945; that was responsible for efficient killing of cancer cells. In 2D cells and 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis that make CoCDb a potential theranostic agent.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain D&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth Based Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand, namely the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA= 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure but synthesized by a reflux method. The red&#8208;shifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores based on &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and full characterization of a family of stable &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines connected in 4,4&#8208;position through a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridges. The impact of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on the optical (absorption/emission) and redox properties is investigated using a joint experimental/theoretical approach. In contrast to the p&#8208;extended ones, the &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8208;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two easily accessible and reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. The in situ formed radical cations are studied by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance. Finally, electrochemical modulation of fluorescence (electrofluorochromism) was performed and revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for further applications as switchable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting methanol&#8208;mediated CO2 hydrogenation into aromatics by synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8% under high reaction temperature (350 oC). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4% and 80.1% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Chiral Resolution of a MnIII Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex with High Temperature 80&#8197;K Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous chiral resolution of the &#916; and &#923; isomers of a racemic mixture of a MnIII spin&#8208;crossover complex is achieved by conglomerate crystallization. The complex exhibits gradual spin crossover with a wide thermal hysteresis, &#8764;80&#8197;K at its maximum, with T1/2&#8593;=250&#8197;K and T1/2&#8595;=200&#8197;K. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism was used to confirm the enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric spin&#8208;switchable systems are of interest for their prospective applications as magnetically active non&#8208;linear optical materials and in multiferroic devices. Chiral resolution of simple spin&#8208;crossover chelate complexes into the &#916; and &#923; forms offers a facile route to homochiral magnetic switches, which could be easily enantiomerically enriched. Here, we report the spontaneous resolution of a new hysteretic spin&#8208;crossover complex, [MnIII(sal2323)]SCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (1), into &#916; and &#923; forms, without the use of chiral reagents, where sal2323 is a Schiff base resulting from condensation of 1,2&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropylamino)ethane with 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. The enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism. Quantum chemistry calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure. The opening of a wide 80&#8197;K thermal hysteresis window at high temperature highlights the potential for good magneto&#8208;optical function at ambient temperature for materials of this type.

Quantum chemistry calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure. The opening of a wide 80&#8197;K thermal hysteresis window at high temperature highlights the potential for good magneto-optical function at ambient temperature for materials of this type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Two novel nona&#8208;coordinated Eu(III) complexes [Eu(btfa)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;1) and [Eu(NTA)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;2) have been synthesized and characterized. The structure of the complexes was elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) methods. The experimental photophysical properties of the complexes were investigated and complemented with theoretical calculations. Effective energy transfer (ET) pathways for the sensitized red luminescence is discussed. The complexes were tested as emitting layers (EML) in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). At the optimum doping concentration of 4&#8197;wt.%, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;1 exhibited red electroluminescence (EL) with an EQE of 4.0&#8201;% and maximum brightness (B)=1179&#8197;cd/m2, maximum current efficiency (&#951;c)=5.64&#8197;cd/A, and maximum power efficiency (&#951;p)=4.78&#8197;lm/W at the current density (J) of 10&#8197;mA/cm2. Interestingly, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;2 at the optimum concentration of 3&#8197;wt.%, displayed an outstanding EL performance with EQE of 7.32&#8201;% and B=838&#8197;cd/m2, &#951;c=10.19&#8197;cd/A and &#951;p=10.33&#8197;lm/W at J=10&#8197;mA/cm2. The EL performance of this device is among the best reported for devices incorporating a europium complex as a red emitter.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Based Terpyridine Complexes as Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 4&#8217;&#8208;X&#8208;terpyridines/tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine silver derivatives with or without phosphines as ancillary ligands has shown high cytotoxicity against different tumour cells. In addition, a great selectivity index has been detected for healthy lymphocytes T in some cases. These derivatives interact with CT&#8208;DNA through moderate intercalation, and cell death studies indicate that they promote an apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
Silver complexes bearing substituted terpyridine or tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine ligands have been prepared and structurally characterised. The study of the anticancer properties of silver complexes with this type of ligands is scarce, despite the possibilities of combining the properties of the metal and the ability of the ligands for DNA binding. Here, the antiproliferative activity, stability, CT&#8208;DNA binding, and mechanism of cell death of these types of derivatives are studied. High cytotoxicity against different tumour cells was observed, and, more important, a great selectivity index has been detected between tumour cells and healthy lymphocytes T for some of these compounds. The CT&#8208;DNA interaction study has shown that these derivatives are able to interact with CT&#8208;DNA by moderate intercalation. Furthermore, cell death studies indicate that these derivatives promote the apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway.

         <title>Latent Pronucleophiles in Lewis Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Allylation of Silyl Enol Ethers with Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of latent pronucleophiles greatly expands the scope of Lewis base catalysis and enables enantioselective allylation of silyl enol ethers setting up to two stereogenic centers in a single operation.







Abstract
Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C&#8208;centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8722;H substituted for C&#8722;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C&#8208;nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio/stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C&#8208;centered nucleophiles.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Cd2+ Removal by MgAl Layered Double Hydroxides with Different Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption mechanism of heavy metals: Cd2+ was removed as CdCO3 for MgAl&#8722;CO3, while Cd2+ could be mineralized in a super&#8208;stable way as CdAl&#8208;LDHs by isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8722;NO3/SO4/Cl. This was attributed to the different binding energies and Gibbs free energies caused by distinct host&#8208;guest interactions of various anions intercalated in MgAl&#8208;LDH.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless, how the host&#8208;guest interactions of LDHs affect the removal mechanism remains to be less explored. Herein, CO32&#8722;/NO3&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/Cl&#8722; intercalated MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions were fabricated and their removal mechanism for Cd2+ was investigated. The removal capacity increased in the order of MgAl&#8722;CO3 (127.3&#8197;mg/g)&lt;MgAl&#8722;SO4 (173.3&#8197;mg/g)&lt;MgAl&#8722;NO3 (305.0&#8197;mg/g)&#8776;MgAl&#8722;Cl (312.5&#8197;mg/g). The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed as CdCO3 for MgAl&#8722;CO3, while for MgAl&#8722;Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was removed as CdAl&#8208;LDHs by an isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that compared to the CdAl&#8208;LDHs formation the Gibbs free energy of the CdCO3 formation was lower, which made it easier to remove Cd2+ as CdCO3 on MgAl&#8722;CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8722;NO3 to obtain CdAl&#8208;LDHs was a free energy reduction process.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bridge Controlled Patterning of BTR:PC71BM Bulk Heterojunction Micro Arrays towards High&#8208;Performance Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for the patterning of organic bulk heterojunctions. The fabricated BTR:PC71BM micropatterns arrays have exhibited hierarchical morphology with suitable domain size, which enhanced the charge generation and transport. For this reason, the fabricated microphotodiodes presented excellent performance with a responsivity of 40.56&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#8197;Jones.







Abstract
The patterning strategy of organic semiconductors is a crucial issue for integrated circuit. However, due to the uncontrollable liquid dewetting, most of the research is mainly focused on the patterning of single component, few works have been done on the patterning of multi&#8208;component or heterojunction, which play an important role in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, a capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for patterning of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro&#8208;arrays, with liquid crystalline BTR and PC71BM utilized as donor and acceptor, respectively. The BTR:PC71BM arrays presented hierarchical morphology with suitable phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge generation and transport. Moreover, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance with the light on/off ratio greater than 2000, the responsivity of 40.57&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1, and specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#8197;Jones. Such progress demonstrates that the capillary&#8208;bridge strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality BHJ micropatterns arrays.

         <title>Room Temperature Hydroxyl Group&#8208;Assisted Preparation of Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adjustable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework UiO&#8208;66 Composites: Towards Continuous Oil Collection and Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8722;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid is vital for the hydrophobic modification. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for continuous oil collection and emulsion separation by coating modified UiO&#8208;66 on porous substrates.







Abstract
Developing a straightforward and effective hydrophobic modification for metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild conditions is meaningful for MOF applications. Here, a post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8722;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) is the vital force for the modifier TDPA. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for efficient oil&#8208;water separation by coating TDPA&#8208;modified UiO&#8208;66 (P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) on commercial melamine sponges (MS) and filter papers (FP) with water contact angles of 153.2&#176; and 155.6&#176;, respectively. The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS composite could quickly and selectively absorb oily liquids up to 43&#8197;times its weight from water. The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS achieved continuous oil collection with high separation efficiencies (&#8805;99.4&#8201;%). In addition, P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/FP and P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS showed high separation efficiencies for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions (&#8805;98.5&#8201;%) and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, respectively, with high resistance to low/high temperatures and acid/base conditions. The metal hydroxyl group&#8208;assisted post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy offers a facile and broad way to prepare hydrophobic MOFs for promising applications in environmental fields.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Enamides by Hydrogen Atom Transfer Alkene Isomerization Using Dual Cobalt/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of polysubstituted enamides via metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer by merger of cobalt/photoredox catalysis was achieved. The judicious choice of Co(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;CF3&#8208;salophen) and Co(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalophen) enabled access to polysubstituted enamides. The method tolerated haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
M&#8208;HAT isomerization is a highly reliable method to access thermodynamically stable alkenes with high functional group tolerance. However, synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes by M&#8208;HAT isomerization reaction is still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enamide synthesis using M&#8208;HAT via a combination of cobalt and photoredox catalysis. This method tolerates a variety of functional groups including haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug derivatives. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Base&#8208;Triggered Oxidative Addition to Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P&#8208;chelation assisted strategy to promote oxidative addition of C(sp2)&#8722;I bonds to gold has been extended to secondary phosphine oxides, but in contrast with related phosphines, a base (NEt3, K2CO3) is needed. Back&#8208;donation prevails over donation in such oxidative additions. The reaction gives access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes whose SPO moiety can be chemically derivatized.







Abstract
The coordination of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) was shown to efficiently promote the activation of C(sp2)&#8722;I bonds by gold, as long as a base is added (NEt3, K2CO3). These transformations stand as a new type of chelation&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to gold. The role of the base and the influence of the electronic properties of the P&#8208;ligand were analyzed computationally. Accordingly, the oxidative addition was found to be dominated by Au&#8594;(Ar&#8722;I) backdonation. In this case, gold behaves similarly to palladium, suggesting that the inverse electron flow reported previously (with prevailing (Ar&#8722;I)&#8594;Au donation, resulting in faster reactions of electron&#8208;enriched substrates) is a specific feature of electron&#8208;deficient cationic gold(I) complexes. The reaction gives straightforward access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes. The possibility to chemically derivatize the SPO moiety at Au(III) was substantiated by protonation and silylation reactions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogenative Reactions Using Liquid Hydrogen Donors: Mechanisms, Catalysts Design, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent development in heterogeneous photocatalysis for hydrogenative reactions from the perspective of hydrogen donors. The basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from organic molecule and water, donation to the target acceptor, and the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials are discussed.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light&#8208;induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.

     alt="Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogenative Reactions Using Liquid Hydrogen Donors: Mechanisms, Catalysts Design, and Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept summarizes recent development in heterogeneous photocatalysis for hydrogenative reactions from the perspective of hydrogen donors. The basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from organic molecule and water, donation to the target acceptor, and the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light-induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Dehydrogenative Reverse Prenylation of Indoles with 2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient C&#8208;3 regioselective dehydrogenation reverse prenylation of indoles has been developed by use of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene as the prenylation reagent. The protocol is of atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economies.







Abstract
Bulk chemical 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene, one of the main C5 distillates of the petrochemical industry, has scarcely been utilized directly in synthesizing high&#8208;value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Herein, we use 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene as the starting material to develop a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective C&#8208;3 dehydrogenation reverse prenylation of indoles. This synthetic method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economies.

         <title>Reactivity Differences of Trigonal Pyramidal Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo and Iron(III)&#8208;Oxo Complexes: Experiment and Theory.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Like Supramolecular Polymers with Dual Motion Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benefiting from the features like polymeric linear structures, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic adaptiveness, supramolecular polymers (SPs) are favored as exploiting muscle&#8208;like materials, allowing for imitating the muscle functions. However, a substantial part of these materials barely owned an unitary motion orientation while it was obviously known that muscle movements involved distinct orientations. Herein, M1 holding the structure of 44&#8208;membered macrocycle with two aldehyde&#160;groups was designed, meanwhile, M2 comprising of secondary ammonium ions, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups as well as the alkyl chains was fabricated, for which it could be assembled with M1 to generate SPs based on host&#8208;guest interactions from a large macrocycle and two secondary ammonium ions. SPs underwent vertical compression upon the addition of N2H4 owing to the forming dynamic covalent bonds, notably, mechanically interlocked structures were also generated. Afterwards, the vertically compressed SPs experienced horizontal shrinkage when tetrabutylammonium chloride was contributed due to the destruction of host&#8208;guest interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzyne&#8208;Derived Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544 m2&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;and very high CO2/N2&#160;selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery of a novel strategy to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1&#8209;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented O&#8209;triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late&#8208;stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stable, easily accessible salt [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8211; (RF = C(CF3)3) was used as a NiI synthon to generate the novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene = C6H6, o&#8208;dfb = 1,2&#8208;F2C6H4). By irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium, even the rather endergonic reaction to a [Ni(o&#8208;dfb)2]+ salt was successful (DrG&#176;(solv) = +78&#160;kJ mol&#8211;1). The latter displays an unprecedented slipped &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;sandwich structure and is the ultimate synthon to NiI&#8208;chemistry.</dc:description>

All roads lead to hydrogen. an in&#8208;depth analysis and comparison of hydrogen evolution reactions in gas phase model systems reveal five distinct mechanistic routes to form either atomic or molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Molecular processes behind hydrogen evolution reactions can be quite complex. In macroscopic electrochemical cells, it is extremely difficult to elucidate and understand their mechanism. Gas phase models, consisting of a metal ion and a small number of water molecules, provide unique opportunities to understand the reaction pathways in great detail. Hydrogen evolution in clusters consisting of a singly charged metal ion and one to on the order of 50 water molecules has been studied extensively for magnesium, aluminum and vanadium. Such clusters with around 10&#8211;20 water molecules are known to eliminate atomic or molecular hydrogen upon mild activation by room temperature black&#8208;body radiation. Irradiation with ultraviolet light, by contrast, enables hydrogen evolution already with a single water molecule. Here, we analyze and compare the reaction mechanisms for hydrogen evolution on the ground state as well as excited state potential energy surfaces. Five distinct mechanisms for evolution of atomic or molecular hydrogen are identified and characterized.

         <title>Can Copper(I) and Silver(I) be Hydrogen Bond Acceptors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>

Hydrogen bonding with metals has recently been shown to take place with gold(I) compound. With the help of gas&#8208;phase IR spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we show, that similar interactions should exist also with Silver and Copper, with equipped with suitably designed ligands.







Abstract
Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated in the 3AuCl+ (3+=1&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;((dimethylammonio)methyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) complex. However, similar hydrogen bonding interactions with isoelectronic silver(I) or copper(I) centers are unknown. Herein, we first explored whether the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond originally observed in 3AuCl+ can be strengthened by replacing Cl with Br or I. Experimental gas&#8208;phase IR spectra in the &#8764;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region showed only a small effect of the halogen on the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond. Next, we measured the spectra of 3AgCl+, which exhibited significant differences compared to its 3AuX+ counterparts. The difference has been explained by DFT calculations which indicated that the Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction is only marginal in this complex, and a Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H hydrogen bond is formed instead. Calculations predicted the same for the 3CuCl+ complex. However, we noticed that for Ag and Cu complexes with less flexible ligands, such as dimethyl(2&#8208;(dimethylammonio)phenyl)phosphine (L7H+), the computations predict the presence of the respective Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H hydrogen bonds, with a strength similar to the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond in 3AuCl+. We, therefore, propose possible complexes where the presence of (Ag/Cu)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bonds could be experimentally verified to broaden our understanding of these unusual interactions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;Based Fluorophores Derived by &#960;&#8208;Extended Systems: Opposite Mechanofluorochromism, Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Bioimaging</title>

Two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(tetraphenylethene)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior.







Abstract
Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono&#8208;shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(TPE)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X&#8208;1 changed from blue to green with reversible redshifted 27&#8197;nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X&#8208;2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue&#8208;shifted 74&#8197;nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order&#8208;crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking mode by induced &#960;&#8208;extended systems. In addition, these TPE&#8208;based fluorophores (X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2) exhibited excellent bio&#8208;compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio&#8208;imaging, writable data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Assessing Combinations of B(C6F5)3 and N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitrido Complexes for Heterolytic Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen&#8208;derived nitrides have been explored as Lewis base component for frustrated Lewis pair type heterolytic bond splitting with B(C6F5)3 as the Lewis acid. d0 and d2 molybdenum nitrides both form stable adducts with B(C6F5)3. If Si&#8722;H bond splitting could be achieved, B&#8722;H bond activation of HB(C6F5)2 was not observed, this borane entering in competition with B(C6F5)3 to pair with the nitride without any further reactivity.







Abstract
Two different dinitrogen&#8208;derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type heterolytic E&#8722;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E=Si) and HB(C6F5)2. Whereas Si&#8722;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C6F5)2 was shown to substitute B(C6F5)3 in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8722;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.

If Si&#8722;H bond splitting could be achieved, B&#8722;H bond activation of HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was not observed, this borane entering in competition with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to pair with the nitride without any further reactivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two different dinitrogen-derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair-type heterolytic E&#8722;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E=Si) and HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Whereas Si&#8722;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was shown to substitute B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8722;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PPh3 helps protect against pathogens: Conjugated oligoelectrolytes are a modular molecular platform for the design of novel antimicrobial agents. Substituting terminal alkylammonium cationic groups with more lipophilic triphenylphosphonium counterparts enabled bactericidal activity towards ESKAPE pathogens and clinically relevant mycobacteria. In vivo efficacy was verified in a murine wound model, at clinically relevant dosages.







Abstract
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene&#8208;conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing the development of significant bacterial resistance. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99&#8201;% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in&#8197;vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis of the Cloke&#8208;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventionally, the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases. Herein, a chalcogen bonding catalysis approach to the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is established, affording dihydrofurans with moderate to good yields.







Abstract
The Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is an important method to construct heterocycles which was conventionally facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases. A weak interaction catalysis approach to the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement remains a challenging topic and yet no example is reported. Herein, a chalcogen bonding catalysis method to achieve the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is described that involves activation of carbonyl cyclopropanes by double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. This chalcogen bonding catalysis approach afforded a wide range of dihydrofurans with good yields, thus establishing an alternative strategy to catalyze the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement.

Active BAPO &#8208; An NHS ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) is synthesized by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used as the first versatile transfer agent for the grafting of photoactive BAPO units. Amino acids, porcine skin, and poly(amido)amine (PAMAM) dendrimers were functionalized with the photoactive units and used for the synthesis of thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking.







Abstract
A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS) ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups, such as amino acids, proteins, and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby, a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.

A photo&#8208;induced indole 2&#8208;alkylation reaction using unactivated, sterically congested alkenes as the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reagent gives a variety of 2&#8208;branched alkylated indole molecules in generally good efficiencies, with a broad scope of functional groups well tolerated.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced indole 2&#8208;alkylation reaction was developed with unactivated stereo&#8208;congested alkenes used as the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reagent. The neutral, traceless and inexpensive perfluoroalkyl iodide C4F9I was used as the radical initiator in catalytic amount under irradiation by a blue LED light. Br&#248;nsted acids are in&#8197;situ generated from the radical transfer reactions between the indole substrates and the perfluoroiodide catalyst. A variety of 2&#8208;branched alkylated indole molecules could be obtained from this approach in generally good efficiencies, with a broad scope of functional groups well tolerated. Mechanistic studies via both experimental and computational methods indicate that the reaction was accelerated by the protons generated from the crack of the indole&#8208;derived radical cation species.

S&#8208;containing anion exchange process as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to realize the capacitive enhancement of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. The roles of anion exchange include the evolution in the surface morphology of nanoparticles, the enhancement of the crystallinity and resistance nature, and the improved durability stability.







Abstract
Anion exchange is recognized as an effective method to regulate the composition, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical behavior of the transition metal&#8208;based compounds. In this work, anion exchange is adopted as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to facilitate the capacitive activity of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1 to 841&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as&#8208;assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles.

         <title>Biohybrid Microswimmers for Antibiotic Drug Delivery Based on a Thiol&#8208;Sensitive Release Platform</title>

Green kills. Antibiotic&#8208;loaded microswimmers kill bacteria after being triggered by a chemical stimulus. The design was based on thiol&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolative linkers, vancomycin, and green algae as natural microbots.







Abstract
This study reports on the design and engineering of biohybrid microswimmers exploiting a thiol&#8208;mediated self&#8208;immolative antibiotic release strategy. The design features a covalent attachment of a vancomycin conjugate via a disulfide&#8208;based linker to the surface of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The antibiotic release from the surface of these biohybrids was triggered by the addition of a thiol&#8208;based reducing agent, and, subsequently, the inhibition of bacterial growth was observed for Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These engineered microbots represent the first example of a microalgae&#8208;based drug delivery system with a thiol&#8208;mediated, reductive release of an antibiotic drug.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Oligosaccharides for Studying Xylan&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>

Xylan biosynthesis: Starting from dixylosides, chemo&#8208;enzymatic syntheses of xylan dodecasaccharides using glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions between glycosyl fluoride donors and thioglycoside acceptors were performed. These long&#8208;chain xylan oligosaccharides were incubated with xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes from plants, i.&#8201;e., three glycosyltransferases and one acetyltransferase, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS.







Abstract
Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.

Abstract
Three non&#8208;fused A&#8722;D&#8722;A&#8217;&#8722;D&#8722;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;free small molecules BT&#8208;IT1, BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 have been synthesized and their absorption characteristics and redox properties, as well as charge carrier mobilities have been investigated. The resultant molecules exhibited broad absorption in the range of 325&#8211;600&#8197;nm in solutions and in thin films the absorption range is 350&#8211;700&#8197;nm. These new conjugated small molecules showed low&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;5.49 to &#8722;5.50&#8197;eV), deep LUMO energy levels (&#8722;3.67 to &#8722;3.69&#8197;eV) and narrow bandgaps of (EgCV) &#8764;0.79&#8197;eV. Appreciable electron mobilities for compounds BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 were 4.56&#215;10&#8722;3 and 1.12&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, obtained by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Additionally, excellent photocatalytic performances of BT&#8208;2T (6), BT2F&#8208;2T (10), BT&#8208;IT1, BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 for highly selective oxidation of thioanisole to desired sulfoxides under visible light irradiation were observed.

         <title>The Tunable and Efficient Nanoporous CuAg Alloy Catalysts Toward Methanol Oxidation Reaction Synthesized by Electrochemical Dealloying of Metallic Glassy Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional nanoporous CuAg alloy catalysts with various Cu/Ag ratios are prepared by electrochemical dealloying of metallic glassy precursors. The NPCu1.75Ag catalyst presents the best methanol electro&#8208;oxidation properties, including a high current density and good operation stability. The designed electrodes are expected to be promising catalysts for alkaline direct methanol fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoporous CuAg (NPCuAg) alloy catalysts with various Cu/Ag ratios are prepared by electrochemical dealloying of metallic glassy (MG) precursors. All dealloyed samples exhibit homogenous nanoporous structure and element composition distribution. After systematically evaluating their electrocatalytic performance toward MOR, it was found that the catalytic activity of the NPCuAg catalysts is enhanced along with the increase of Cu/Ag ratio, which may be attributed to the more exposed active reaction sites derived from high surface area of nanoporous structure and the optimal synergistic effect. Thus, the NPCu1.75Ag alloy catalyst presents the best methanol electro&#8208;oxidation properties, including a high current density of 397.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good operation stability that retaining 84.5&#8201;% catalytic activity even after 7200&#8197;s. These results outperform most reported copper&#8208;based MOR catalysts in alkaline methanol solution. Considering these advantages, the designed electrodes are expected to be promising catalysts for alkaline DMFCs applications.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Stabilized CsPbI3 Nanocrystals with Tailored Organic Polymer Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable black&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals capped with a new organic polymer ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3, have been synthesized by hot&#8208;injection method with significantly improved resistance to moisture and light.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Herein, stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups, are reported. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70&#8201;% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tetraarylethylenes Enabled by Reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dimetallation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation of diarylacetylenes is described. The key intermediates, trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, are prepared by sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes and the subsequent transmetallation to zinc. The present reaction enables the stereoselective synthesis of tetraarylethylenes which have been difficult to prepare according to the conventional methods.







Abstract
Tetraarylethylenes (TAEs) have been gaining attention from various scientific disciplines for their characteristic chemical and physical properties. From the synthetic perspective, however, efficient methods for the selective synthesis of different isomers of TAEs are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of TAEs by means of sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes. Subsequent transmetallation to zinc generates trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, which underwent the stereoselective arylation under a palladium catalysis to afford a variety of TAEs that had been difficult to prepare according to the conventional procedures. In addition, the present method accommodates not only diarylacetylenes but also alkyl aryl acetylenes and thus enables to synthesize a wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Scaffold Remodelling of Diazaspirotricycles Enables Synthesis of Diverse sp3&#8208;Rich Compounds With Distinct Phenotypic Effects</title>

         <dc:description>
Structural and functional diversity from simple precursors: an efficient entry into a diverse sp3&#8208;rich compound library was achieved by scaffold remodelling (ring cleavage, expansion and addition) of readily&#8208;prepared spirotricyclic ureas. The resulting library shows significant scaffold diversity despite the common precursors, while individual compounds demonstrate distinctive phenotypic effects in the cell&#8208;painting assay, suggesting the library is also functionally diverse.







Abstract
A &#8216;top down&#8217; scaffold remodelling approach to library synthesis was applied to spirotricyclic ureas prepared by a complexity&#8208;generating oxidative dearomatisation. Eighteen structurally&#8208;distinct, sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds were accessed from the parent tricycle through ring addition, cleavage and expansion strategies. Biological screening of a small compound library based on these scaffolds using the cell&#8208;painting assay demonstrated distinctive phenotypic responses engendered by different library members, illustrating the functional as well as structural diversity of the compounds.

Photoswitching in presence of water: decoration of cyclic dipeptides with heteroarylidene substituents produces novel biocompatible molecular photoswitches. They show high thermal stability, and are operational under aqueous conditions with an organic co&#8208;solvent. Extended heteroaromatic system enables bidirectional switching with visible light.

Hemipiperazines are a recently discovered class of peptide&#8208;derived molecular photoswitches with high biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. Here, for the first time we describe photochromism of heterocyclic hemipiperazines. They demonstrate long thermal lifetimes, and enlarged band separation between photoisomers. Efficient photoisomerization occurs under aqueous conditions, although with a need for organic co&#8208;solvent. Bidirectional switching with visible light is observed for an extended aromatic system.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photoswitching in presence of water&lt;/b&gt;: decoration of cyclic dipeptides with heteroarylidene substituents produces novel biocompatible molecular photoswitches. They show high thermal stability, and are operational under aqueous conditions with an organic co-solvent. Extended heteroaromatic system enables bidirectional switching with visible light.

         <title>The Boekelheide Rearrangement of Pyrimidine N&#8208;oxides as a Case Study of Closed or Open Shell Reactions &#8208; Experimental and Computational Evidence for the Participation of Radical Intermediates</title>

Heterocycles: The rearrangement of a model pyrimidine N&#8208;oxide with carboxylic acid anhydrides provides the acyloxymethyl&#8208;substituted compounds as major products. In addition, other compounds derived from radical intermediates are formed in considerable amounts under certain conditions. By comprehensive experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, a rationale for the apparently competing mechanisms is proposed. The pathways via closed shell and open shell intermediates are compared.







Abstract
In a case study, the acetic anhydride&#8208;promoted reaction of a model pyrimidine N&#8208;oxide to the corresponding 4&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidine derivative (Boekelheide rearrangement) was investigated in detail by experiment and quantum chemical calculations. The reaction conditions were varied and several side products formed in low to moderate yields were identified. These experiments indicate that a (pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl radical is one of the key species of the rearrangement. This interpretation was supported by the fact that rearrangements performed in solvents which can easily lose hydrogen atoms, afford considerable quantities of products incorporating the solvent. With TEMPO the key radical could be trapped. Other carboxylic acid anhydrides confirm the conclusion that the Boekelheide rearrangement of the model pyrimidine N&#8208;oxide proceeds, at least in part, via radical intermediates. The high level closed and open shell quantum chemical calculations show that concerted [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements or stepwise processes, either via ion pairs or via radicals, are energetically feasible.

         <title>Unexpectedly Large Structural Variations in Benzyl&#8208;Substituted Sila[1]ferrocenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four related silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes show large variations of the tilting of Cp rings in the crystal lattice. While the measured tilt angles range from 16.6 to 21.5&#176;, calculated values range from 19.6 to 20.8&#176;. With the help of DFT calculations, the unexpected experimental results are rationalized and placed into the contexts of known outliers of the sila[1]ferrocenophane family.







Abstract
A set of four planar&#8208;chiral sila[1]ferrocenophanes equipped with a benzyl group in the &#945;&#8208;position, either on one or both Cp rings, and substituted on the bridging silicon atom, either by methyl or phenyl groups, were prepared. While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring&#8208;tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>

Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing: We report a mitochondria&#8208;targeted cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (Mito&#8208;CPDs), which is not only compatible with commercially available gene&#8208;silencing reagents without the need of chemical or genetic modifications, but also capable of transporting siRNA and ASO into mitochondria and thereby silencing mtDNA specifically.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ Substitution Induced Dual&#8208;Site Synergistic Catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Co2+ to Al3+ substitution in Al4B6O15 lattice leads to the dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis, that is the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction between &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene adsorbed and activated at the Lewis acidic site (unsaturated Co2+) and the indole molecule, which is activated by an adjacent reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (Ov). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.&#8201;g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, that is, 98, 93, 96, 92 and 90&#8197;% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial Ov, leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.

Single crystal to single crystal transition: This study reports the synthesis of two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) and the transformation of iHOF&#8208;10 to iHOF&#8208;11. The results show that water molecules induce the single crystal to single crystal transition process, as well as increase the proton conductivity.







Abstract
Two ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (iHOF&#8208;10, iHOF&#8208;11) were prepared using 1,1&#8242;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine diiodide (Dbpy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I) and tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE). With increasing RH and temperature, water molecules induce single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformation of iHOF&#8208;10, resulting in the formation of iHOF&#8208;11. At 90&#8201;&#176;C, 98&#8201;% RH, the proton conductivity of iHOF&#8208;11 (7.03&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) is 2.09 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (3.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). At 50&#8201;&#176;C, 98&#8201;% RH, iHOF&#8208;11 (9.49&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) is 19.06 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (4.98&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The proton conductivity shows water molecules enter the crystal and induce crystal transformation and reorganization of the hydrogen bonding structure, thus increasing the proton conductivity and stability.

         <title>Structural Engineering of Red Luminogens to Realize High Emission Efficiency through ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR organic luminogens, FITPA and FIMPA, were developed. The &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; configurations have been demonstrated to enhance the transition dipole moments. Moreover, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA is induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behavior endow FIMPA intense luminescence in the solid state. Furthermore, the promising cell&#8208;imaging performance verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications.







Abstract
Deep red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR, &gt;650&#8197;nm) emissive organic luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviours have emerged as promising candidates for applications in optoelectronic devices and biological fields. However, the molecular design philosophy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with narrow band gaps are rarely explored. Herein, we rationally designed two red organic luminophores, FITPA and FIMPA, by considering the enlargement of transition dipole moment in the charge&#8208;transfer state and the transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE. The transition dipole moments were effectively enhanced with a &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; molecular configuration. Meanwhile, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA was induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation originated from a crystallization&#8208;induced emission (CIE) effect because of additional weak interactions in the aggregate state introduced by methoxy groups. Owing to the enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behaviour, FIMPA presented intense luminescence covering the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 38&#8201;% in solid state. The promising cell&#8208;imaging performance further verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications. These results provide a guideline for the development of red and NIR AIEgens through comprehensive consideration of both the effect of molecular structure and molecular interactions in aggregate states.

A novel antibacterial diterpenoid: The chemical investigation of Hainan soft coral Sinularia nanolobata, has led to the isolation and characterization of a novel antibacterial diterpenoid, Nanolobatone A, featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[10.3.0.01,2]pentadecane carbon skeleton, along with eight new casbane&#8208;type diterpenoids.







Abstract
Nanolobatone A, featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[10.3.0.01,2]pentadecane carbon skeleton, along with four new polyoxygenated and four unusual endoperoxide&#8208;bridged casbane&#8208;type diterpenoids were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sinularia nanolobata. The structures of the new compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of new isolates was proposed. Bioassays revealed that nanolobatone A showed weak antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes.

         <title>Revealing the Crystal Phase&#8208;Activity Relationship on NiRu Alloy Nanoparticles Encapsulated in N&#8208;Doped Carbon towards Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing the N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. The hcp phase NiRu has better HER performance, and the NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (&#8764;70&#8201;%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1.







Abstract
Adjusting the crystal phase of a metal alloy is an important method to optimize catalytic performance. However, detailed understanding about the phase&#8208;property relationship for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still limited. In this work, the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. It is found that the NiRu@NC (mix) with both face&#8208;centred cubic (fcc) and thermodynamically unstable hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase NiRu give the best HER performance. Further activity studies demonstrate that hcp NiRu has better HER performance, and NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (&#8764;70&#8201;%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The high HER activity of NiRu@NC (mix) is attributed to the formation of hcp phase. This finding indicates that the regulation of crystal structure can provide a new strategy for optimizing HER activity.

         <title>Access to Amide&#8208;Linked Organic Cages by in&#8197;situ Trapping of Metastable Imine Assemblies: Solution Phase Bisamine Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The majority of shape&#8208;persistent self&#8208;assembled organic cages are accessed via precipitation and studied in the solid state. Herein, we show that metastable imine cages (unsuitable for precipitation) can be trapped directly by in&#8197;situ Pinnick oxidation conditions, yielding soluble, robust amide cages. Unlike the by&#8208;passed imine cages, the resulting cages are tolerant of hydrolysis conditions to unmask internal carboxylic acids, which undergo 2&#8208;point binding with amines (unsuitable guests for imine cages).







Abstract
Molecular cages are sought after as receptors and catalysts. However, typical dynamic covalent chemistry approaches restrict the shape&#8208;persistence, solubility and stability of self&#8208;assembled organic cages. As a result, organic cages occupy a narrow chemical and functional space, and solution&#8208;phase applications and studies remain rare. We report an in&#8197;situ trapping protocol, using Pinnick oxidation conditions, to convert soluble metastable imine assemblies to robust amide cages, and exemplify the method to access previously inaccessible organic cages. The new cages are internally functionalised with two constrained and diametrically opposed carboxylic acid groups that can distinguish between functionalised piperazines in THF. We anticipate our approach will broaden access to robust, soluble, self&#8208;assembled organic cages of an unsymmetrical or semi&#8208;flexible nature, which in turn will drive advances in solution&#8208;phase applications of molecular cages.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Dihaloalkenynes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and regioselective PdII&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation of haloalkynes has been established under ligand&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Careful selection of the haloalkyne starting material, with respect to electron densities of the alkyne, allows for strong control of the order and selectivity of the halide atoms in the coupled product.







Abstract
Herein, the PdII&#8208;catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self&#8208;haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro&#8208;oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole&#8208;containing, pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione&#8208;containing and silyl&#8208;protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloroalkenyne or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;chloroalkenyne products as desired.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis enables an oxygen&#8208;sensitive energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalysed [2+2] photocycloaddition in water and under aerobic conditions. Micellar effects suppress undesired quenching of triplet states by molecular oxygen through low oxygen solubility and compartmentalization of the micellar reaction mixture. Additionally, activation of the substrates towards sensitization by hydrogen bonding in the Stern layer is proposed, allowing efficient triplet energy transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]2+.







Abstract
Micellar photocatalysis has been used to overcome oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet&#8208;energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self&#8208;assembling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were found to increase the oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen&#8208;sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds to energy transfer and allow [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place. Our preliminary studies of micellar effects on energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;based reactions demonstrate the reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes in a mixture of SDS, water and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2.

Acid test for Tyr and Trp: S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the S&#8208;chlorocysteine allows Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation. The one&#8208;pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.







Abstract
A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides 1 in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium functionalization of a conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) with a stilbene core improved its spectrum of activity to include ESKAPE pathogens and mycobacteria while crucially retaining the membrane&#8208;perturbing mode of action characteristic of COEs. The efficacy of the lead compound in&#8197;vivo highlights the potential of the COE molecular platform for designing more effective antibiotics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Triphenylphosphonium functionalization of a conjugated oligoelectrolyte&lt;/b&gt; (COE) with a stilbene core improved its spectrum of activity to include ESKAPE pathogens and mycobacteria while crucially retaining the membrane-perturbing mode of action characteristic of COEs. The efficacy of the lead compound in&#8197;vivo highlights the potential of the COE molecular platform for designing more effective antibiotics.

         <title>Cover Feature: Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water (Chem. Eur. J. 26/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis allows for a simple and benign reaction set&#8208;up using water as the solvent without the need for oxygen&#8208;removing protocols. Blue light (456&#8197;nm) is absorbed by the photocatalyst and allows the [2+2] photocycloaddition to occur between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes. The observed reactivity for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is completely turned on by the use of a micellar solution as opposed to organic solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. N&#230;sborg and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300627).

The aromatic (C&#8722;H) sulfenylation reaction with S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) can be Trp&#8208; or Tyr&#8208;selective under acidic conditions. The red chloride anion team kicks the Cys(Acm)(O) ball into the Trp goal, whereas the blue trimethylsilyl team kicks the ball into the Tyr goal. The proton scoreline in the stands supports both teams. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300799).

Noncovalent interactions are weak, but they can be used in the control of selectivity in homogeneous catalysis. In fact, overturn the selectivity from a 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 1&#8201;:&#8201;99 ratio of products can require only 6&#8197;kcal/mol energy difference between competing transition states. For details, see the Review by Mahmudov and Pombeiro (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203861).

         <title>Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity directing mission of noncovalent interactions (hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen and tetrel bonds, as well as agostic and &#960;&#8208;interactions) in homogeneous catalysis is highlighted. The origin of the selectivity in noncovalent catalysis has been investigated through experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
The regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, stereo&#8208; or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi&#8208;steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst&#8208;substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.

     alt="Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The selectivity directing mission&lt;/b&gt; of noncovalent interactions (hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen and tetrel bonds, as well as agostic and &#960;-interactions) in homogeneous catalysis is highlighted. The origin of the selectivity in noncovalent catalysis has been investigated through experimental and computational methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regio-, site-, stereo- or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal-ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi-steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst-substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Anion Exchange Membranes in Hydrogen&#8208;electricity Energy Conversion Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 26, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges and corresponding strategies of anion exchange membranes are summarized to provide valuable predictions for the advancement of hydrogen&#8208;electricity energy conversion devices, including anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer and anion exchange membrane fuel cell. Discussion is focused on membrane key properties (anion conductivity, long&#8208;term stability) and device applications (membrane&#8208;electrode interface, carbonation effect, water management).







Abstract
Alkaline hydrogen&#8208;electricity energy conversion technologies, involving anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are more appealing than the acidic counterparts due to the elimination of precious metal catalysts. However, the physicochemical properties of anion exchange membrane (AEMs), i.e., ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, stability, etc., are inferior to that of proton exchange membranes (PEMs), thus hindering these alkaline technologies from practical employment. To promote their development, we summarize the main challenges and the corresponding strategies of AEMs for the application of AEMFCs and AEMWEs in this review. The hydroxide transportation mechanism, ion exchange capacity, hydration and microscopic morphology that are relevant to the ionic conductivity are discussed firstly. Following the ionic conductivity, another obstacle, stability of AEMs is comprehensively described in terms of alkaline stability, mechanical stability and electrochemical stability. Upon integrating into the devices, water management, carbonation effect and membrane&#8208;electrode interface that are critical to the cell performance are highlighted as well. This review is anticipated to provide insights into the AEM design for hydrogen&#8208;electric energy conversion devices, thus accelerating the widespread commercialization of these promising technologies.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation for Dynamic Oscillation during Self&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a real&#8208;time observation and molecular dynamics investigation, we identified a non&#8208;equilibrium interaction occurring in the self&#8208;assembled pathway of A&#946;42 that dominated neuronal survival during interplay with an oscillator. A specific bait could further lengthen the lifetime of dynamic oscillation for heteromolecular binding by slowing down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42, enhancing the efficiency of A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells.







Abstract
The dynamic oscillation implicated in structural heterogeneity during the self&#8208;assembly of amyloid peptide 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42) may play a crucial role in eliciting cellular responses. We developed a real&#8208;time monitoring platform to observe an oscillatory non&#8208;equilibrium interaction that dominated the A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells during interplay with an oscillator (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Molecular dynamics studies indicated that the electrostatic and hydrophobic segments of LPS involved in the temporary heteromolecular association and slightly decelerated the intrinsic thermally&#8211;induced protein dynamics of A&#946;42. A bait&#8208;specific intervention strategy could temporarily slow down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42 to extend the lifetime of autonomous oscillation and augment A&#946;42 clearance of neuronal cells. The lifetime increment of oscillation shows a bait concentration&#8208;dependent manner to reflect the non&#8208;equilibrium binding strength. This relationship may serve as a predictor for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.

         <dc:description>In recent years, the strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. Taking advantage of synergistic visible light photocatalysis with organocatalysis, remarkable progress has recently been achieved in modern chemical synthesis. In these dual catalytic systems, photocatalysts or photosensitizers absorb visible light to induce their photo&#8208;excited states which can activate unreactive substrates via electron or energy transfer mechanisms, and organocatalysts are usually employed to control the chemical reactivities of the other substrates. This review mainly focuses on the recent development of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Finding an ideal biorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for biorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&#160;&gt;103&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, we designed a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. We conjugated the pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. Our azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH 5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, we were able to show that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH 5.0 and neutral pH 7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that NPdiCl is a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperatively Catalyzed Activation of Thioglycosides That Bypasses Intermediacy of Glycosyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is the development of a novel method for activating thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate. This has been achieved through the use of a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine. Unreactive in the presence of iodine, disarmed thioglycosides showed high reactivity under the developed reaction conditions. It has been demonstrated that the stereocontrol can be achieved using the H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method, and the extended glycan synthesis can be achieved via the iteration of protecting group removal and glycosylation steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Sequential Catalytic Arylation&#8208;Fukuyama Cross&#8208;coupling of 1,1&#8208;Biszincioalkane Linchpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one pot double cross&#8208;coupling sequence employing gem C(sp3)&#8208;organodizinc dinucleophiles is achieved for the first time with high enantioselectivity through an original strategy relying on the combination of a first non&#8208;stereoselective desymmetrization reaction delivering a racemic stereolabile mono&#8208;organozinc intermediate that undergoes subsequent catalytic deracemization. A modular entry to enantioenriched 1&#8208;arylalkyl ketones is developed.







Abstract
1,1&#8208;Bis(iodozincio)alkanes are used as dinucleophilic linchpins in an enantioselective double cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence involving aryl iodides and then thioesters. The two catalytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions are achieved in the same pot through two distinct palladium&#8208;based catalytic systems: a first non&#8208;enantioselective one delivering configurationally labile secondary benzylzinc species from an achiral precursor, and a second enantioconvergent one that operates a highly efficient dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic intermediates. This strategy, new in the area of asymmetric synthesis through two consecutive electrophilic substitution reactions of geminated C(sp3)&#8208;organodimetallics, provides useful methodology to access in a modular fashion acyclic &#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketone products with very high enantiomeric purity.

         <title>A Brick&#8208;Wall Topological 2D Covalent Organic Framework Constructed from an H&#8208;Shaped &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Monomer</title>

         <dc:description>
A rare brick&#8208;wall topological imine COF (H&#8208;Blm&#8208;COF) was prepared by self&#8208;condensation of an H&#8208;shaped &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomer, which displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes.







Abstract
As an emerging class of porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H&#8208;shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self&#8208;polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole&#8208;based COF (H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF) with a rarely reported brick&#8208;wall topology. H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF displayed high crystallinity, nano&#8208;sized porosity, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents, which related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, for example chromium black T (99.7&#8201;%) and rhodamine B (97.3&#8201;%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configurations.

         <title>Intermolecular Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Amination/Carbonylation via Nucleophilic Addition of Simple Amines to Arene &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multicomponent reaction for dearomative 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation of chromium&#8208;bound arenes using simple amines as nitrogen source has been developed, providing rapid access to poly&#8208;functionalized alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities.







Abstract
The incorporation of the privileged amino functionality is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. In contrast to the well&#8208;developed amination methods for alkenes, the dearomative amination of arenes is largely underexplored due to the inherently inert reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds and selectivity challenges. Herein, we report an intermolecular dearomative aminofunctionalization via direct nucleophilic addition of simple amines to chromium&#8208;bound arenes. This multicomponent 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation reaction enables rapid access to complicated alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities from benzene derivatives under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, which also represents the first application of nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in &#951;6&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced arene dearomatizations.

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deoxygenative boration of widely occurring amides is developed, which combines relay and cooperative catalysis with Ir&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organo catalysis to build structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;amino organoborons in one pot.

One of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis is to develop novel methodologies for rapid construction of complex molecules starting from easily available yet inert raw materials. In this context, multi&#8208;catalysis strategies have attracted great attention in the discovery of new reactivity profiles that may allow access to many difficult or unattainable transformations. So far the deoxygenative functionalization of ubiquitous amides is usually achieved by nucleophilic attack on the imine or iminium ion intermediate formed via activation of the C=O bond, and these functionalization reagents were often confined to C&#8208;based nucleophiles, which largely limited the diversity of the resultant amines. Herein, we disclose a combined strategy of relay and cooperative catalysis with a triple iridium&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organocatalysis system to achieve an unprecedented reductive boration of amides, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products which are viable building blocks. In this transformation, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of amides is successfully incorporated with photo&#8208;organic catalyzed nucleophilic boryl radical addition, thus delivering the corresponding &#945;&#8208;boryl amines in high efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;A deoxygenative boration of widely occurring amides is developed, which combines relay and cooperative catalysis with Ir-photoredox-organo catalysis to build structurally diverse &#945;-amino organoborons in one pot. The boryl radical generated in&#8197;situ is applied as the functionalization partner instead of traditional nucleophile in this reductive transformation of amides, thus overcoming the limitation of [C]-functionalization reagents to deliver high value-added &#945;-boryl amines.

         <title>&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;Iodanes: Substituent Effects and Pseudorotation/Hypervalent Twisting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivities of iodanes. Judicious exploitation of sterics around iodine atom of the iodane is found to enhance its reactivity. This review collates the literature developments on the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation in iodanes, and their synthetic applications.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine (III and V) compounds exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivity of &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes. By judicious exploitation of sterics, the twisting process in iodanes can be facilitated to promote reactivity. For example, ortho&#8208;substitution in &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes accelerates &#945;&#8208;tosyloxylation of ketones and oxidation of alcohols. The enhancement of reactivity arises from sterically&#8208;induced non&#8208;planarity and the resultant weakening of the 3c&#8211;4e bonds involving the hypervalent iodine atom. The ortho&#8208;substitution constitutes an important strategy to maneuver reactivity, control selectivity, and develop new catalysts, including chiral, for diverse reactions. This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.

         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry is a valuable tool used by modern synthetic chemists who use electricity to facilitate redox reactions. In this image, created by Karrar Nadhom, the dragon provides the electrical surge to create a reaction between sodium nitrite and a secondary amine, which are fused to form the N&#8208;nitroso product. Despite dragons being extinct in most parts of the world, the title reaction is an ecologically green process, as indicated by the colour of the dragon. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Wirth and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300957).

         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component umpolung cascade reaction of phenols, C60, and nucleophiles has been developed as a practical and efficient protocol for one&#8208;pot synthesis of diversified 1,4&#8208;[60]fullerephenols.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component umpolung cascade coupling reaction of phenols, C60, and different nucleophiles which includes H2O, alcohols, triphenylamines and carbazoles was developed. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot 1,4&#8208;bisphenol coupling on C60 has been realized by this method. This practical protocol features high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, wide substrate range, easy operation and low cost, thus providing a robust method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various unsymmetrical 1,4&#8208;[60]fullerephenols.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Magnetic Modulation in a Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Dyad Piezochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behaviour of an isotopically enriched dysprosium piezochromic mononuclear complex was modulated by applying an external pressure.







Abstract
The extreme sensitivity of trivalent lanthanide ions to crystal field variations led to the emergence of single&#8208;molecule magnetic switching under various stimuli. The use of pressure as an external stimulus instead of classic light irradiation, oxidation or any chemical reactions allows a fine tuning of the magnetic modulation. Here the well&#8208;known pure isotopically enriched [162Dy(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 (162Dy) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) (tta&#8722;=2&#8208;2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L=4,5&#8208;bis(propylthio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine) was experimentally investigated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction and squid magnetometry under high applied pressures. Both reversible piezochromic properties and pressure modulation of the slow magnetic relaxation behavior were demonstrated and supported by ab initio calculations. The magnetic study of the diluted sample [162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 (162Dy@Y) indicated that variations in the electronic structure have mainly intermolecular origin with weak intramolecular contribution. Quantitative magnetic interpretation concludes to a deterioration of the Orbach process for the benefit of both Raman and QTM mechanisms under applied pressure.

         <title>Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small and stable colloidal nanoparticles of copper, cuprous oxide and cuprous sulfide were synthesized exploiting the organometallic chemistry of copper mesityl. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of X&#8208;type carboxylate and di(thio)carboxylate ligands were used to produce colloidal nanoparticles; the nature of the ligand influences both the nanoparticle solubility and stability.







Abstract
This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo&#8208;copper precursor, mesitylcopper(I) [CuMes]z (z=4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu2O or Cu2S nanoparticles. Use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro&#8208;ligand; 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;equivalents vs. [CuMes]z) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro&#8208;ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro&#8208;ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu2O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu2S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands. This work highlights the opportunities for organometallic routes to well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and the need for appropriate ligand selection.

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-small and stable colloidal nanoparticles of copper, cuprous oxide and cuprous sulfide were synthesized exploiting the organometallic chemistry of copper mesityl. Sub-stoichiometric quantities of X-type carboxylate and di(thio)carboxylate ligands were used to produce colloidal nanoparticles; the nature of the ligand influences both the nanoparticle solubility and stability.

         <title>To Isomerize or not to Isomerize? E/Z Isomers of Cyclic Azobenzene Derivatives and Their Reactivity Upon One&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of azo compounds generally results in isomerization forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. It is shown that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species.







Abstract
Azo compounds are efficient electron acceptors. Upon one&#8208;electron reduction they generally isomerize forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. Herein we show that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species. Markedly, diazonines, which bear a central nine membered heterocycle, show light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization, but retain the configuration of the diazene N=N moiety upon one&#8208;electron reduction. Accordingly, E/Z isomerization is not induced by reduction.

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BASHY dyes, such as the one drawn in the foreground, are prepared in a multicomponent reaction. This is symbolized by the background, which shows part of a beach that is made of sea&#8208;washed stones and which is located in the North of Portugal (Praia de Belinho). The BASHY dyes discussed in the Research Article by P.&#8197;M.&#8197;P. Gois, U. Pischel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300579) show several photophysical features such as fluorescence, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which jointly orchestrate the function of the dye.

4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI) is a key diisocyanate linker in the production of polyurethanes. 4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI is thermally unstable, undergoing dimerization to unreactive and insoluble uretdione. The &#8220;catch&#8211;store&#8211;release&#8221; strategy presented in the Research Article by S. Groysman and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300924) allows 4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI to be stabilized in the form of an imidazolium amidate that is produced by the coordination of two equivalents of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. The complex can be released by heating with CuCl (with or without sulfur); this forms a CuI carbene/urea complex and restores MDI. Artwork by the authors with help from Mary Iverson.

         <title>Organoiridium Complexes Enhance Cellular Defense Against Reactive Aldehydes Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive aldehyde species (RASP) have been implicated in numerous diseases due to their ability to alkylate or crosslink biomolecules. In this work, it was demonstrated that iridium small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts protect cells from RASP&#8208;induced cell death with greater efficiency than conventional aldehyde scavengers. A catalyst&#8208;based detoxification strategy could offer unique benefits over those relying on stoichiometric reactants.







Abstract
Although reactive aldehyde species (RASP) are associated with the pathogenesis of many major diseases, there are currently no clinically approved treatments for RASP overload. Conventional aldehyde detox agents are stoichiometric reactants that get consumed upon reacting with their biological targets, which limits their therapeutic efficiency. To achieve longer&#8208;lasting detoxification effects, small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts (SIMCats) were used to protect cells by converting RASP into non&#8208;toxic alcohols. It was shown that SIMCats were significantly more effective in lowering cell death from the treatment with 4&#8208;hydroxynon&#8208;2&#8208;enal than aldehyde scavengers over a 72&#8197;h period. Studies revealed that SIMCats reduced the aldehyde accumulation in cells exposed to the known RASP inducer arsenic trioxide. This work demonstrates that SIMCats offer unique benefits over stochiometric agents, potentially providing new ways to combat diseases with greater selectivity and efficiency than existing approaches.

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biradical formation vs. &#960;&#8208;bonding: The low&#8208;valent, highly reactive pnictogen compounds PnCH3 (Pn=As, Sb) have been generated in situ by controlled homolysis of Pn(CH3)3 in the gas phase and investigated by photoelectron&#8211;photoion coincidence spectroscopy. This allowed us to establish trends in nature's strategy to stabilize low&#8208;valent pnictogen species either by tautomerization with concomitant multiple bond formation (HPn=CH2) or by biradical formation (Pn&#8722;CH3). The graphic illustrates the energetic steps separating the isomers of these fundamentally important group 15 compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Lichtenberg, P. Hemberger, I. Fischer and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300637).

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8208;Th&#8208;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC) based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant S811 with the opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive the self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened due to that heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation, so the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Meanwhile, the throughput of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which meets the need in some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be applied to buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight Induced and Alternative Sc(OTf)3 Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Halogenation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remote C5&#8208;H halogenation has been achieved ether by natural light or catalytic Sc(OTf)3 under mild condition. Moreover, the cascade C6&#8208;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed.







Abstract
A mild and catalyst&#8208;free sunlight induced protocol for the remote meta bromination of electron&#8208;deficient indoles is described for the first time. Herein, N&#8208;bromosaccharin is activated by sunlight irradiation. Alternately, a synergistic activation model (Sc(OTf)3/HFIP) has also been developed for the activation of haloniums, complementary to the light induced strategy. In addition, the cascade C6&#8208;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed. High regio&#8208;and chem&#8208;selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and scalability demonstrate great potential of the developed methods in practical applications and further functionalization.

         <title>Numerical Simulation and Experimental Study of Methyl Ammonium Bismuth Iodide Absorber Layer Based Lead Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SCAPS&lt;?&#8194;&gt;1D simulation software was to investigate the simulation of lead&#8208;free methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) based perovskite solar cells. The study examined various electron and hole transport layers and optimized the thickness of each layer using the software. The results showed a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% via the simulation software, and reasonable efficiency and open circuit voltage in the fabricated MA3Bi2I9 based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the development and production of perovskite or perovskite&#8208;like materials that do not contain lead (Pb) for the purpose of constructing solar cells. The development and testing of lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;like structures for solar cells is crucial. In this study, we used the solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS) to simulate perovskite solar cells based on methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9). The electron&#8208;transport layer, hole&#8208;transport layer, and absorber layer thickness were optimized using SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO2/MA3Bi2I9/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au) performed well with a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% and a reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34&#8197;V, using the optimized conditions determined by SCAPS. Additionally, we conducted experiments to fabricate perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.31&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCAPS&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;? &amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;1D simulation software&lt;/b&gt; was to investigate the simulation of lead-free methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) based perovskite solar cells. The study examined various electron and hole transport layers and optimized the thickness of each layer using the software. The results showed a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% via the simulation software, and reasonable efficiency and open circuit voltage in the fabricated MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; based perovskite solar cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the development and production of perovskite or perovskite-like materials that do not contain lead (Pb) for the purpose of constructing solar cells. The development and testing of lead-free perovskite-like structures for solar cells is crucial. In this study, we used the solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS) to simulate perovskite solar cells based on methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;). The electron-transport layer, hole-transport layer, and absorber layer thickness were optimized using SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) performed well with a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% and a reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34&#8197;V, using the optimized conditions determined by SCAPS. Additionally, we conducted experiments to fabricate perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.31&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>UV&#8208;Blocking and Light&#8208;Responsive Poly (&#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone)/ZIF&#8208;8 Multifunctional Composite Films for Efficient Antibacterial Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PQZ composite films have many concurrent properties, including antibacterial, UV&#8208;blocking, hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and high tensile strength, which are extremely important for their application as food packaging materials.







Abstract
Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has received considerable attention owing to its superiority. ZIF&#8208;8 was used to address the poor stability of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) encapsulation to synthesize RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, which were doped into a composite film with poly (&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;quaternary ammonium chitosan (PVA&#8208;QCS) as substrates to form composite films (PQZ). The composite films exhibited excellent photodynamic sterilization and good resistance to bacterial adhesion. The tensile strength of the film increased to 43.4&#8197;MPa, which was approximately 1.8&#8197;times that of the PCL film. With the addition of SiO2 and RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, the film exhibited water repellency and UV&#8208;blocking properties. RAW264.7&#8197;cells were selected using the MTT method to confirm that the composite films had excellent biocompatibility and had no significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and reproduction. PQZ multifunctional composite films show potential as novel APDT antimicrobial materials for food packaging.

         <title>Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Based Cuboid Constructed by Chiral Self&#8208;Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuboid constructed by self&#8208;discrimination of a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) is reported. Iodine vapor is used to stimulate the cuboid structure to transform its stacking mode. The cuboid&#8208;stacking mode collapsed and opened the sealed cavity of TBBP in the process of the formation of TBBP&#8208;iodine complexes. Additionally, TBBP shows high iodine uptake up to 3.43&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Cuboid, a basic geometric structure, has been widely applied in architecture and mathematics. In chemistry, the introduction of cuboid structures always provides a specific structural shape, enhances the stability of the structure and improves the performance of materials. Herein, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;discrimination to construct a cuboid&#8208;stacking crystal material is proposed, in which a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) based on Tr&#246;ger's base (TB) and benzophenone (BP) was synthesized as the building element of the cuboid. The cuboid is designed to be transformable compared with cuboid structures in previous work. For this reason, it is considered that the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure can be transformed through external stimulation. Iodine vapor is selected as the external stimulus to transform the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure due to the favorable interaction between iodine and the cuboid. The changes in the stacking mode of TBBP is studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). To our surprise, this Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;based cuboid shows strong iodine adsorption capacity up to 3.43&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits potential as a crystal material for iodine adsorption.

         <title>Excited State Processes in Supramolecular Complexes of Cyclic Dibenzopyrrolopyrrole Isomers with C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge separation and low sensitivity to the spatial orientation of monomeric units in tetramer make host&#8211;guest complexes of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles attractive for photovoltaic applications.







Abstract
An approach to modulating the properties of carbon nanorings by incorporating pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units is of particular interest due to the combined effect of heteroatom and antiaromatic character on electronic properties. The inclusion of units other than phenylene leads to the formation of stereoisomers. In this work, we computationally study how the spatial orientation of monomeric units in the ring affects the properties of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles and their complexes with C60 fullerene. For [4]PP and [4]DHPP, the most symmetrical AAAA isomer is the most stable and forms stronger interactions with fullerene than the isomers where one or two monomeric units are flipped, mostly due to less Pauli repulsion. &#960;&#8208;Electron delocalization in the monomeric unit is crucial for directing the electron transfer (from or to nanoring). The energy of excited states with charge transfer depends on the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which varies from one stereoisomer to another only for [4]DHPP&#8835;C60 with aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units. The rates of electron transfer and charge recombination reactions are relatively weakly dependent of the spatial isomerism of nanorings.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8208;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8208;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method&#8217;s utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Thienoindolizines and their Benzo&#8208;Fused Derivatives:

Synthesis and Physical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of thienoindolizine structural isomers have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29% to 95%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Control over the Threading of Pyrophosphonates with One&#160;or Two Cyanostar Macrocycles during Pseudorotaxane Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2:1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl and Alkenyl Halides from Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl and alkenyl halides are widely used as key intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly for the formation of organometallic reagents or as radical precursors. They are also found in pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. In this work, we report the synthesis of aryl and alkenyl halides from the corresponding fluorosulfonates using commercially available ruthenium catalysts. Notably, this is the first conversion of phenols to aryl halides that is efficient with chloride, bromide, and iodide. Fluorosulfonates are readily prepared using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and less expensive substitutes for triflates. Although aryl fluorosulfonates and their reactions are well known, this is the first report of an efficient coupling of alkenyl fluorosulfonates. To finish, we have demonstrated, by means of representative examples, that the reaction is possible in a one&#8208;pot process, starting directly from the phenol or aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Cycling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur&#160;batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their outstanding theoretical energy density. However, they suffer from low sulfur utilization and poor cyclability, greatly limiting their practical implementation. Herein, we adopted a phosphate&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) as an&#160;inorganic host for sulfur. With their porous structure, remarkable electrochemical stability, and synthetic versatility, Zr&#8208;MOFs present great potential in preventing soluble polysulfides from leaching. Phosphate groups were introduced to the framework post&#8208;synthetically since they have shown a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and an ability to facilitate Li ion transport. The successful incorporation of phosphate in MOF&#8208;808 was demonstrated by a series of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis. When employed in batteries, phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;MOF (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4) exhibits significantly enhanced sulfur utilization and ion diffusion compared to the parent framework, leading to higher capacity and rate capability. The good capacity retention and inhibited self&#8208;discharge rate also demonstrate effective polysulfide encapsulation utilizing MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4. Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high&#8208;density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon&#160;nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization to the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure Multi&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Y&#8208;Shaped D&#8208;A Type Thioxanthone Derivatives: Mechano&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and High&#8208;Contrast Mechano&#8208;Responsive Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;contrast mechano&#8208;responsive luminescence (MRL) materials with mechano&#8208;induced emission enhancement properties are fascinating candidates but few, for applications in rewritable media and recording devices. Here, an interesting design strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type molecules for high&#8208;contrast MRL materials was presented, based on substituted diphenylamine donor and planar acceptor. Interestingly, their D&#8208;A torsion angles are small in crystals but increased after ground, resulted in planar and twist intramolecular charge transfer (PICT and TICT) states, respectively. Therefore, high&#8208;contrast MRL switching between weak blue (450 nm) fluorescence and bright yellow (552 nm) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can be achieved for compound TXDO (4,4'&#8208;dimethoxydiphenylamine donor), which photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 2.8% to 54.7% after ground. Most importantly, the two independent D&#8208;A conjugation dihedral angles are actually independent in the &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; molecules. Especially for compound TXDT (4,4'&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylamine donor), its crystal exhibited both PICT and TICT processes inside, resulted from the different dihedral angles of 11.8&#176; and 35.5&#176;, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-contrast mechano-responsive luminescence (MRL) materials with mechano-induced emission enhancement properties are fascinating candidates but few, for applications in rewritable media and recording devices. Here, an interesting design strategy of &#8220;Y-shape&#8221; donor-acceptor (D-A) type molecules for high-contrast MRL materials was presented, based on substituted diphenylamine donor and planar acceptor. Interestingly, their D-A torsion angles are small in crystals but increased after ground, resulted in planar and twist intramolecular charge transfer (PICT and TICT) states, respectively. Therefore, high-contrast MRL switching between weak blue (450 nm) fluorescence and bright yellow (552 nm) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can be achieved for compound TXDO (4,4'-dimethoxydiphenylamine donor), which photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 2.8% to 54.7% after ground. Most importantly, the two independent D-A conjugation dihedral angles are actually independent in the &#8220;Y-shape&#8221; molecules. Especially for compound TXDT (4,4'-di-tert-butyldiphenylamine donor), its crystal exhibited both PICT and TICT processes inside, resulted from the different dihedral angles of 11.8&#176; and 35.5&#176;, respectively. The TXDT crystal thus showed dual-peak emission, including both TICT fluorescence and PICT room-temperature phosphorescence. Therefore, this strategy of "Y-shape" D-A type molecules provide a new approach to design advanced luminescent materials with mechano-induced TADF feature, for high-contrast MRL and single-component white luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide Stapling&#160;with Boronate Esters&#8211; A Reversible Folding of (Artificial) Peptide Chain to &#945;&#8208;Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of a peptide conformation via stapling strategy may be realized by the reversible or more often irreversible connection of side chains being in mutually appropriate geometry. An incorporation of phenylboronic acid and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid), attached to two lysine side chains via amide bonds and separated by 2, 3, or 6 other residues in the C&#8208;terminal fragment of RNase A introduces the intramolecular interaction stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;helical organization. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain. We investigated the possibility of using switchable stapling by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV&#8208;CD spectroscopies, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer a varying degree of electrolyte confinement.

         <dc:description>Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pent&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;4&#8208;ynals in one pot.

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Boronic Acid Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functional RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronate ester linkages can be formed in&#8197;situ by the reaction of an oligonucleotide bearing a 5&#8242;&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another oligonucleotide in a template&#8208;directed manner. Boronate ester bonds replacing the natural phosphodiesters in oligonucleotides have been shown to stabilize split hairpin ribozyme variants and a split version of the Mango aptamer, and restore activity.







Abstract
Boronate esters formed by reaction of an oligonucleotide carrying a 5&#8242;&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another have been shown previously to assist assembly of fragmented DNAzymes. Here we demonstrate that boronate esters replacing the natural phosphodiester linkage at selected sites of two functional RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the Mango aptamer, allow assembly of functional structures. The hairpin ribozyme, a small naturally occurring RNA that supports the reversible cleavage of appropriate RNA substrates, is very sensitive to fragmentation. Splitting the ribozyme at four different sites led to a significant decrease or even loss of cleavage and ligation activity. Ribozymes assembled from fragments capable of boronate ester formation showed restoration of cleavage activity in some but not all cases, dependent on the split site. Ligation proved to be more challenging, no supportive effect of the boronate ester was observed. Split variants of the Mango aptamer also showed a dramatic loss of functionality, which however, was restored when 5&#8242;&#8208;boronic acid modified fragments were used for assembly. These studies show for the first time that boronate esters as internucleoside linkages can act as surrogates of natural phosphodiesters in functional RNA molecules.

Amphiphilicity in the same direction: The singlet carbene centre in [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M=Fe, Ru, Os) displays ambiphilic reactivity in the same direction which can be attributed to the possible excitation from an spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital to the low&#8208;lying transition metal&#8208;centred orbitals.







Abstract
Singlet carbenes are extensively studied compounds capable of electrophilic, nucleophilic or ambiphilic behaviour. The ambiphilic reactivity of singlet carbenes has been conventionally observed in orthogonal planes. Here, we report a detailed bonding and reactivity study of a homobimetallic carbon complex [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M=Fe, Ru, Os) that shows ambiphilicity in the same direction. The structure of this complex can be considered as two fused three&#8208;membered M&#8722;C&#8722;M and M&#8722;N&#8722;M rings. The bonding analysis suggests that these 17 valence electron homobimetallic complexes have one formal M&#8722;M bond with a bridging carbene centre featuring a high&#8208;lying spn&#8208;hybridised lone pair. Accordingly, the carbene centre shows high proton affinity and act as a good 2e&#8722; donor to Lewis acids and transition metal fragment. Apart from the transition metal non&#8208;bonding electrons, the &#960;&#8208;framework of M&#8722;C&#8722;M and M&#8722;N&#8722;M arms can be best described as 3c&#8211;2e&#8722; bonds. The two transition metals in the four&#8208;membered skeleton generate many low&#8208;lying, virtual orbitals. These low&#8208;lying virtual orbitals induce electron excitation from the spn&#8208;hybrid orbital in presence of H&#8722; and other 2e&#8722; donor ligands such as PMe3, NHC and CO. Hence, the spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital shows &#963;&#8208;hole reactivity in presence of Lewis bases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singlet carbenes are extensively studied compounds capable of electrophilic, nucleophilic or ambiphilic behaviour. The ambiphilic reactivity of singlet carbenes has been conventionally observed in orthogonal planes. Here, we report a detailed bonding and reactivity study of a homobimetallic carbon complex [(MCp*)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-NPh)(&#956;-C)] (&lt;b&gt;1M&lt;/b&gt;, M=Fe, Ru, Os) that shows ambiphilicity in the same direction. The structure of this complex can be considered as two fused three-membered M&#8722;C&#8722;M and M&#8722;N&#8722;M rings. The bonding analysis suggests that these 17 valence electron homobimetallic complexes have one formal M&#8722;M bond with a bridging carbene centre featuring a high-lying sp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridised lone pair. Accordingly, the carbene centre shows high proton affinity and act as a good 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; donor to Lewis acids and transition metal fragment. Apart from the transition metal non-bonding electrons, the &#960;-framework of M&#8722;C&#8722;M and M&#8722;N&#8722;M arms can be best described as 3c&#8211;2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bonds. The two transition metals in the four-membered skeleton generate many low-lying, virtual orbitals. These low-lying virtual orbitals induce electron excitation from the sp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-hybrid orbital in presence of H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and other 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; donor ligands such as PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NHC and CO. Hence, the sp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-hybrid lone pair orbital shows &#963;-hole reactivity in presence of Lewis bases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed, Annulative Multiple C&#8208;H Bond Activations of BODIPYs to Access &#960;&#8208;Extended Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Molecules with Deep Red Emissions and Self&#8208;aggregation Behaviors</title>

One&#8208;pot of Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8208;H activation, via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs react with 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes to obtain acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs showed strong deep red absorptions/emissions and high fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Aromatic ring fusion on BODIPY core can effectively tune its electronic property, and red&#8208;shift its absorption and emission wavelength. In this work, we report that a one&#8208;pot Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8722;H activation to access acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs though the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs and 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes. These newly synthesized acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs revealed intensified deep red absorptions (639&#8211;669&#8197;nm) and emissions (643&#8211;683&#8197;nm), with high fluorescence quantum yields (0.53&#8211;0.84) in dichloromethane. Notably, these acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs exhibited well&#8208;defined self&#8208;aggregation behavior in water/THF mixture, and for instance, the absorption of 3&#8201;a was red&#8208;shifted by 53&#8197;nm to 693&#8197;nm after forming aggregates.

         <title>Development of the Safe and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Aldehyde and Ketoamide Mpro inhibitors Derived from the Constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA Peptide Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA peptides served as a novel scaffold to design aldehydes and ketoamides to inhibit the Mpro of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. They show excellent inhibitory activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and broad&#8208;spectrum activity against different other HCoVs. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mpro with inhibitors demonstrated the mechanism of covalent inhibition of Mpro.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is still wreaking havoc all over the world with surging morbidity and high mortality. The main protease (Mpro) is essential in the replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, enabling itself an active target for antiviral development. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a new class of peptidomimetics&#8208;constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA peptides, based on which a series of aldehyde and ketoamide inhibitors of the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were prepared. The lead compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity in the FRET&#8208;based Mpro enzymatic assay not only for the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 but also for SARS&#8208;CoV and MERS&#8208;CoV, along with HCoVs like HCoV&#8208;OC43, HCoV&#8208;229E, HCoV&#8208;NL63 and HKU1. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic results demonstrated that our compounds form a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145. They also demonstrated effective antiviral activity against live SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Overall, the results suggest that &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA peptide could be a promising molecular scaffold in designing novel Mpro inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other coronaviruses.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides Enabled by Selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy for the cyclization of N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes is disclosed, wherein vinyl selenium and hydroperoxide are involved as the key intermediates.







Abstract
A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy has been used to cyclized of N&#8208;propargylamides. This method offers readily access to oxazole aldehydes under chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions with low catalyst loadings, where air acts as a terminal and gratuitous oxidant. The reaction is demonstrated with a range of substrates, including aryl and alkyl propargyl amides, and in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several amide&#8208;containing drug molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the acridinium catalyst is able to oxidize diselenide and generate singlet oxygen (1O2), which is responsible for this transformation.

         <title>Precisely Designed Difunctionalized Cyclodextrin Produces a Solid&#8208;State Organic Porous Hierarchical Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical assembly: A porous hierarchical crystalline network was built using the macrocyclic&#8208;based supramolecular polymerization strategy. The precise di&#8208;functionalization of the &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin using hydrophobic functions encoded for three different hierarchical levels: a first supramolecular polymer, a second hexameric column and a third trihexagonal packing which ultimately give rise to channel&#8208;like pores.







Abstract
Regioselective di&#8208;functionalization of a cyclodextrin allows hydrophobic domains to be directed in a geometrically controlled manner. This controlled orientation ultimately gives access to an original hierarchical assembly in the solid state. This assembly spans over three levels of hierarchy which are governed by synergistic host&#8208;guest inclusions, directed hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding. This combination of interactions precisely positioned in space through regioselective functionalization of a cyclodextrin creates a porous organic architecture.

         <title>A Greener Pathway to Enantiopurity: Mechanochemical Deracemization through Abrasive Grinding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopurity is of crucial importance for compounds of biological interest. Over the last decade, various solution&#8208;based deracemization technologies have been introduced, transforming a racemic mixture into an enantiopure compound. Here we thrust deracemization into the era of Green Chemistry, being the first to enable deracemization mechanochemically, with as a bonus deracemization occurring over a matter of hours instead of days as observed for the solution&#8208;based processes.







Abstract
We report the first case of mechanochemical deracemization by using liquid&#8208;assisted abrasive grinding. The target molecule is a precursor of Paclobutrazol, an important fungicide and plant growth inhibitor. Using mechanochemical deracemization, we are even able to transform a 10&#8201;%&#8201;ee scalemic mixture of this latter in an enantioenriched product of 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee in a couple of hours. This is substantially shorter compared to solution&#8208;based deracemization methodologies. The present paper thus introduces an efficient and greener process to enantiopure material.

         <title>Dichotomy of Delocalization/Localization and Charge&#8208;Shift Bonding in Germanazene and its Heavier Group 14 Analogues: a Valence Bond Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A valence bond study is carried out to explore the structure, bonding, and &#960;&#8208;delocalization in the E3(NH)3 (E=Ge, C, Si, Sn, Pb) rings. Our findings indicate that a nonbonded structure, wherein the &#960;&#8208;electron density is localized on each N atom, dominates the ground states of these molecules, and the natures of the E&#8722;N bonds as charge&#8208;shift types.







Abstract
We present here a valence bond analysis of structure and &#960;&#8208;delocalization in Ge3(NH)3, which models germanazene that was prepared by Power et&#8197;al. To get a broader perspective, we explore the entire E3(NH)3 series (E=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). Thus, while (4n+2)&#960; systems of carbon rings are aromatic with cyclic &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the E3(NH)3 rings are dominated by a nonbonded structure, wherein &#960;&#8208;lone pairs are localized on the N atoms. Nevertheless, these molecules enjoy large covalent&#8208;ionic resonance energies of 153.0, 86.6, 74.2, 61.2, and 58.9&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively, for E=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. The covalent&#8208;ionic mixing in E3(NH)3 creates &#960;&#8208;systems, which are stabilized by charge&#8208;shift bonding. Thus, unlike in benzene, in Ge3(NH)3 delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electron pairs of the N atoms is primarily confined to the domains of their adjacent Ge atoms. These features carry over to the substituted germanazene, Ge3(NAr)3 (Ar=Ph).

         <title>Dynamically Visualized Mechano&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly System for Small Molecule Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isoguanosine&#8208;visualized mechano&#8208;responsive supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a simple one&#8208;pot reaction. It is formed by metastable boronate ester bonds, metal coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds, which allows for 9 times mechano&#8208;responsive releases of isoG and ultimately shows potential in ultrasound drug release.







Abstract
The mechano&#8208;responsiverelease of small molecules has received extensive attention in ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled drug release in recent years because it can achieve non&#8208;invasive, spatiotemporally controlled precise drug release. However, the vast majority of small molecules mechano&#8208;release reported so far are based on polymer systems, which suffer from complex preparations and single mechano&#8208;response. Here, an isoguanosine (isoG) visualized mechano&#8208;responsive supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a one&#8208;pot reaction. It is completely composed of small molecules, which allows for multiple mechano&#8208;responsive releases of isoG (at least 9&#8197;times) and ultimately has potential for application in US drug release. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach reveals the supramolecular network structure (formed by the joint action of related metal coordination bonds, boronate ester bonds and hydrogen bonds mediated by isoG) gradually formed inside the system is the underlying internal mechanism. Therefore, it provides a new and effective idea of small molecule release in the field of mechanochemistry.

         <title>The Impact of the Solvent Dielectric Constant on A&#8592;NH3 Dative Bond Depends on the Nature of the Lewis Electron&#8208;Pair Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of the solvent can be rather opposite depending on the dative bond complex under consideration. This is demonstrated using two different systems, namely H3B&#8592;NH3 and {Zn&#8592;(NH3)}2+ in selected solvents.







Abstract
The present work aims to determine to what extent the value of the dielectric constant of the solvent can influence the dative bond in Lewis electron pair bonding systems. For this purpose, two different systems, namely H3B&#8592;NH3 and {Zn&#8592;(NH3)}2+, were studied in selected solvents with significantly different dielectric constants. Based on the results from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods using DFT, constrained DFT, energy decomposition analyses, solvent accessible surface area, and charge transfer calculations, we found that the stability of the neutral H3B&#8592;NH3 system increases with increasing solvent polarity. In contrast, the opposite trend is observed for the positively charged {Zn&#8592;(NH3)}2+. The observed changes are attributed to different charge redistributions in neutral and charged complexes, which are reflected by a different response to the solvent and are quantified by changes in solvation energies.

         <title>Optimization and Automation of Helical Aromatic Oligoamide Foldamer Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;resin folding during solid&#8208;phase synthesis is not always an impediment! Under optimized conditions, helices of aromatic oligoamide foldamers are produced in high yield even when their length reaches tens of units. Automation of synthesis on a commercial peptide synthesizer is a game changer for the development of these compounds.







Abstract
Helically folded oligoamides of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid composed of up to 41&#8197;units were prepared using optimized manual solid&#8208;phase synthesis (SPS). The high yield and purity of the final products places these SPS protocols among the most efficient known to date. Furthermore, analytical methods allowing for the clear identification and purity assessment of the products were validated, including 1H&#8197;NMR, a seldom used method for such large molecules. Adaption of the SPS protocols, in particular using in&#8197;situ acid chloride activation under Appel's conditions, made it possible to efficiently implement SPS on a commercial peptide synthesizer, leading to a dramatic reduction of the laboratory work required to produce long sequences. Automation constitutes a breakthrough for the development of helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aziridines and Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aziridines with aryl bromides has been developed to access the desired &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives and beyond. This method exhibited a broad substrate scope, and proved to be a powerful approach to the late&#8208;stage cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of readily available aryl aziridines and aryl bromides under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions to access synthetic useful &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines is developed. This protocol is characterized by its exquisite chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the regioselectivity and reactivity observed are a result of electro&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of aziridines under electroreductive conditions to generate a benzyl radical intermediate as the active species. Furthermore, this strategy also enables cross&#8208;coupling with CO2 to access &#946;&#8208;amino acids under mild conditions.

         <title>Efficient and Low&#8208;Impact Acetalization Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural deep eutectic solvents promote low&#8208;impact acetalization reactions on a wide range of substrates. The reaction medium is fully recycled without weakening of the catalytic activity up to ten times.







Abstract
The synthesis of acetals in acidic natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), in which the solvent itself participates in the catalytic promotion of the reaction, is reported herein. The reaction is performed under feasible conditions, open air, without the need of external additives, catalysts or water&#8208;removing techniques, and it is wide in scope. The products are easily recovered, and the reaction medium is fully recycled and reused without weakening of its catalytic activity after 10&#8197;times. Remarkably, the entire process has been realized on gram scale.

         <title>Small Molecular Fluorescent Probes for Alzheimer's Disease Associated Active Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small&#8208;molecule fluorescent probes for Alzheimer's disease&#8208;related bioactive species are summarized. The chemical structures, response mechanisms, bioapplications of all the probes are presented. The further challenges and instructions for new Alzheimer's disease associated fluorescent probes are also provided.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the main cause of dementia worldwide. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complicated, there is continuous attention to AD&#8208;associated active species, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, metal ions, reactive oxygen/nitrogen/sulphur species, cholinesterase, viscosity, formaldehyde and so on. To this end, a series of small molecular fluorescent probes for these active species have been explored for early diagnosis and even remedy of AD. Herein, we systematacially summarize the versatile fluorescent probes mainly in recent three years, including the relationship between the structure and properties as well as the targeted diagnosis and imaging application of all these fluorescent probes. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD&#8208;related fluorescent probes are briefly explicated. We firmly expect this review may provide guidance for constructing new AD&#8208;relevant fluorescent probes and promote the clinical study of AD.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;Aryldihydroquinolines Using Lithiation &#8211; Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Dihydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of substituted dihydroquinolines was achieved using a kinetic resolution of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines with n&#8208;BuLi and the chiral ligand sparteine. Subsequent lithiation at C&#8208;2 and trapping with an electrophile occurs at C&#8208;4 with retention of stereochemistry to provide an unusual route to enantiomerically enriched 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines.







Abstract
Highly enantiomerically enriched dihydrohydroquinolines were prepared in two steps from quinoline. Addition of aryllithiums to quinoline with tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection gave N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. These were treated with n&#8208;butyllithium and electrophilic trapping occurred exclusively at C&#8208;4 of the dihydroquinoline, a result supported by DFT studies. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy gave kinetic data for the barrier to rotation of the carbonyl group (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;49&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, 195&#8197;K). Lithiation using the diamine sparteine allowed kinetic resolutions with high enantioselectivities (enantiomer ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines could be converted to 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines with retention of stereochemistry. Further functionalisation led to trisubstituted products. Reduction provided enantioenriched tetrahydroquinolines, whereas acid&#8208;promoted removal of Boc led to quinolines, and this was applied to a synthesis of the antimalarial compound M5717.

         <title>Photoluminescence Properties of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Influenced by the Tether Length of Reagents with Two Reactive Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light controlled by tether length: New insights into controlling the photoluminescence (PL) properties of nanotubes were obtained. The tether length of alkylation reagents showed significant selectivity toward controlling the NIR PL wavelength of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes.







Abstract
The functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an effective method for controlling a local band gap, resulting in photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3&#8211;5 (CnH2nBr2: n=3&#8211;5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2 (n=3&#8211;5) tends to result in kinetic products.

         <title>Unique Tubular BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunction with Efficient Separation of Charge Carriers for Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis the hollow tubular g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts modified by flower&#8208;like BiOBr for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The NH3 generation rate of the BC&#8208;2 is 255.04&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and has robust durability. The high photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity of BC&#8208;2 can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light.







Abstract
The industrial ammonia synthesis process consumes a lot of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. As a sustainable approach for ammonia synthesis, photocatalytic nitrogen reduction employing water as the reducing agent has a lot of potential. A simple surfactant&#8208;assisted solvothermal method is used to synthesize g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes with flower&#8208;like spherical BiOBr grown inside and outside (BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4, BC). The hollow tubular structure realizes the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light. Large surface areas and more active sites for N2 adsorption and activation are present in the distinctive spatially dispersed hierarchical structures. Particularly, the quick separation and transfer of electrons and holes are facilitated by the sandwich tubular heterojunctions and tight contact interface of BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. The maximal NH3 generation rate of the BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts can reach 255.04&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, and it is 13.9 and 5.8&#8197;times that of pure BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides a novel method for designing and constructing unique heterojunctions for efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Rhenanaphthalene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its formation may involve two protonation reactions and two migration reactions.







Abstract
Exploration of organometallic metallacycles has led to the development of various polycyclic compounds with fascinating structures, which could be used as functional materials. In this work, a new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its structure was then identified using the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. DFT studies suggest that its formation involves two protonation reactions and two migration reactions. This new rhenanaphthalene isomer enriches the family of metallacycles.

         <title>Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reaction Enabled by Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The tandem hydroformylation&#8208;aldol condensation (tandem HF&#8208;AC) reaction offers an efficient synthetic route to the synthesis of industrially relevant products. The addition of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 to the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of 1&#8208;hexene enables tandem HF&#8208;AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17 times that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5 times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co2(CO)8 and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five new&#160;n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+&#160;cation based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330 &#186;C), phase behaviour (Tg&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8208;55 &#186;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10 mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the&#160;Li+&#160;ions&#160;and the carboxylate group of the anions.&#160;Electrochemically, the electrolytes have&#160;electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5 V, giving some promise for battery application.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications e.g. as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, we report a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86% yield and d.r. &gt; 98:2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84% yield and e.r. up to 97:3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation / electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage, Stereoretentive, and Site&#8208;Selective Modification of Synthetic Peptides by Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage functionalisation is an attractive method to generate peptide analogues containing non&#8208;natural residues. We show that cysteine residues can be activated as Crich&#8208;type thioethers, either by alkylation of a synthetic cysteine&#8208;continuing peptide or via incorporation of a modified cysteine unit into solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis. Photoredox catalysed reaction of the thioether generates an alanyl radical intermediate in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner, even in the presence of free cysteine residues. The radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. A method to avoid unwanted alkylation of amine residues was identified and the process was applied to the functionalization of both linear and cyclic synthetic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Diimidazolium Salt HBDIM: An Easily Available, Low&#8208;Cost CageCarbene Precursor with Broad Applications in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for di&#8208;NHCs ligand, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) was reported. Under basic conditions, HBDIM underwent facile deprotonation to in situ generate CageCarbene which could efficiently coordinate to transition&#8208;metals such as Au, Cu or Pd to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes 2&#8208;4. These complexes were isolated and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. It was found that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator silimar to SIMs and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8208;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much low catalytic reactivity when it was bounded to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd&#8208;complex. Kenetic studies showed that the low reactivity of the monodentate carbene&#8208;ligated Au or Cu complex was due to the low stability of the complex under the reaction condions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the substrate scope of acyltransferase LovD9&#160; for the biosynthesis of statin analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9 acylation mechanism. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimolecular reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = organyl): stepwise vs. concerted mechanism in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R = organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, we use electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, we explore the potential energy surfaces of these systems by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = Me, Et, Bu,  s Bu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8226;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8226; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8226; and CF3&#8226; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8226;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8226; and CF3&#8226; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalysts to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remains underexplored. Herein, DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrated that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterized how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetrically Functionalized Copper and Silver Corrole&#8208;Bis&#8208;Tetracyanobutadiene Push&#8208;Pull Conjugates: Efficient Population of Triplet States via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper and silver tritolylcorroles (TTC) are symmetrically functionalized to carry two tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) entities via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroeletrocyclization reaction involving functionalized corroles with an electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) in excellent yields, as the first examples of corrole&#8208;TCBD push&#8208;pull systems. The strong push&#8208;pull effect resulted in charge polarization in the ground state resulting in a considerable hypsochromic shift, extending the absorption&#160;into the near&#8208;IR region. Electrochemical and computational studies revealed interactions between the TCBD entities via the corrole &#960;&#8208;system and the degree of such interactions was found to depend on the metal ion present in the corrole cavity. Energy considerations suggested charge transfer (CT) from the S2 or vibrationally hot S1 state but not the relaxed S1 state in the case of CuTTC(TCBD)2 while CT to occur from all these states in the case of AgTTC(TCBD)2. Additionally, the high&#8208;energy CT states populate the low&#8208;lying triplet states. Systematic femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies provided the ultimate proof for the occurrence of excited CT as a function of excitation wavelength followed by the efficient population of the triplet states. The present study brings out the significance of charge transfer in efficiently populating the triplet states in rather unusual copper and silver corroles carrying two TCBD entities.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20 K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.</dc:description>

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material&#8217;s solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150 mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33 cm x 2 cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4 V) presented by the OLEDs, which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the boundary of covalency in lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds: Insights from synthesis, molecular and electronic structures of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing the secondary bonding interaction stabilized hybrid organotellurolate ligands. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8'&#8208;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metal (Ln = Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R = C6H4(CH2NMe2)&#8208;2] [3: Ln = Eu, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln = Eu, Solv = acetonitrile; 5: Ln = Yb, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln = Yb, Solv = pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv = tetrahydrofuran, n = 3; 8: Solv = 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n = 2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8208;4 and 7&#8208;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8208;8 are validated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>TLC&#8208;Freeze SERS: A&#160;Powerful Tool for Monitoring Synthetic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification relying on retention factors. Coupling of TLC with surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which gives direct molecular information, is a possible choice, to overcome this challenge. However, interference from the stationary phase and impurities on the nanoparticles added for SERS measurements significantly degrades TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency. We have found that freezing effectively eliminates such interferences and dramatically improves the performance of TLC&#8208;SERS. This study shows that TLC&#8208;freeze SERS is a powerful tool for monitoring essential organic reactions. This method can identify the product and side&#8208;products of similar structures, detect compounds with high sensitivity, and provide information of quantities that allows the reliable determination of the reaction time based on kinetic analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>New Opportunities in Metal Organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings1 which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10 bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8208;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule increases the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics via multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. We envision that the system would find broad applications in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery.</dc:description>

The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine-tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA-based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule increases the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics via multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. We envision that the system would find broad applications in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on-demand drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Haloalkenyl Boronates via Halogenative Semipinacol Rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of stereo&#8208;defined and transformable functionality&#8208;enriched building blocks is of great importance in modern organic chemistry, which allows the rapid and divergent assembly of complex molecules. Reported herein is a halogen electrophile (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) initiated semipinacol rearrangement reaction of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols (MIDA = N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl) via aryl migration towards the synthesis of amphoteric &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates in moderate to good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The value of the products is evidenced by their ability to undergo divergent conversions to polysubstituted alkenes through manipulation of the C&#8208;B and C&#8208;X (X = Br, I) bonds and the carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2&#8208;Anilidomethylpyridine Ligand Framework Showcasing Hydride Storage and Transfer Abilities in Its Aluminum Chemistry.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridyl motifs are significant in both chemistry and biology for their potential abilities to deliver the stored hydride, driven by rearomatization. Biological cofactors like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and organic &#8216;hydride sources&#8217; like Hantzsch esters are prime examples. An organoaluminum chemistry on a 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework is reported, where such hydride storage and transfer abilities are displayed by the ligand&#8217;s pyridyl unit. The pyridylmethylaniline proligand (NNLH) is simultaneously deprotonated and 1,4&#8208;hydroaluminated by AlH3(NMe2Et) to [(NNLde)AlH(NMe2Et)] (1; NNLde = hydride&#8208;inserted dearomatized version of NNL). A hydride abstraction by B(C6F5)3 rearomatizes the pyridyl moiety to give the cationic aluminum hydride [(NNL)AlH(NMe2Et)][HB(C6F5)3] (6). Notably, such chemical non&#8208;innocence is priorly unseen in this established ligand class. The hydroalumination mechanism is investigated by isolating the intermediate [(NNL)AlH2] (2) and by control experiments, and is also analyzed by DFT calculation. The results advocate an intriguing &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; pathway, which underlines alane&#8217;s Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base duality. NMe2Et carrying the alane also plays a crucial role. In contrast, the chemistry between NNLH and AlMe3 is much different, giving only [(NNL)AlMe2] (4) from the adduct [(NNLH)AlMe3] (3) by deprotonation but not a subsequent pyridyl dearomatization in the presence or absence of NMe2Et. This divergence is also justified by DFT analyses.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper reports on two new Dion&#8208;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at ~311 &#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Bifunctional, Raman Active Diyne&#8208;Girder Stapled &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stapled peptides are a unique class of cyclic &#945;&#8208;helical peptides that are conformationally constrained via their amino acid side&#8208;chains. They have been transformative to the field of chemical biology and peptide drug discovery through addressing many of the physicochemical limitations of linear peptides. However, there are several issues with current chemical strategies to produce stapled peptides. For example, two distinct unnatural amino acids are required to synthesise i, i + 7 alkene stapled peptides, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, low purified yields are obtained due to cis/trans isomers produced during ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclisation. Here we report the development of a new i, i + 7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc&#8208;protected alkyne&#8208;amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)&#8208;stereochemistry and 14&#8208;carbon diyne&#8208;girder bridge length. Diyne&#8208;girder stapled T&#8208;STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, cell permeability and stability to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne&#8208;girder constraint is a Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Thienyl&#8208;Substituted Diboranes(4): Electronic Stabilization of Radicals versus Increased Reactivity towards Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state main&#8208;group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically&#8208;shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides&#160;both radical&#8208;anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8210;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8210;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium&#8208;anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8210;B&#8208;bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Ene Click Reaction of Electron&#8208;Deficient &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules with Negative Activation Enthalpies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amino&#8208;ene click reaction is a type of aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction that is congruent with click chemistry in terms of its reaction efficiency and rate under mild conditions. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction is increasingly recognized as a prominent synthetic tool to form C&#8211;N bonds in the context of organic materials chemistry and polymer chemistry. Herein we report an unconventional amino&#8208;ene click reaction with negative activation enthalpies, where an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule such as a naphthalenediimide reacts with an amine faster at lower temperatures. The detailed study of the reaction mechanism reveals that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeds via a pre&#8208;equilibrium reaction, the key to which is the formation of a stable reaction intermediate due to the solvation and charge delocalization on the &#960;&#8208;core. By optimizing the reaction conditions, we demonstrated that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeded faster at 273 K than at 347 K, which was easily observed visually.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An amino-ene click reaction is a type of aza-Michael addition reaction that is congruent with click chemistry in terms of its reaction efficiency and rate under mild conditions. The amino-ene click reaction is increasingly recognized as a prominent synthetic tool to form C&#8211;N bonds in the context of organic materials chemistry and polymer chemistry. Herein we report an unconventional amino-ene click reaction with negative activation enthalpies, where an electron-deficient &#960;-conjugated molecule such as a naphthalenediimide reacts with an amine faster at lower temperatures. The detailed study of the reaction mechanism reveals that the amino-ene click reaction proceeds via a pre-equilibrium reaction, the key to which is the formation of a stable reaction intermediate due to the solvation and charge delocalization on the &#960;-core. By optimizing the reaction conditions, we demonstrated that the amino-ene click reaction proceeded faster at 273 K than at 347 K, which was easily observed visually.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Vacancies on VO2 multilayered Structures for Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) is a proper cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to its shear structure and high theoretical capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and structure instability derived from the strong electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the VO2 host hinder its further application. Defect engineering is a useful way to circumvent the limitations. Herein, oxygen&#8208;defect VO2 (O d &#8208;VO2) with tunable oxygen vacancy concentration are obtained via a facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal method by adjusting ascorbic acid addition. It&#8217;s proved that oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduced electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancy content would lead to a reverse effect. The O d &#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum oxygen vacancy concentration achieves an outstanding performance with a high capacity of 380 mAhg&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1, excellent cycle stability with 92.6% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 3 A g&#8208;1 and a high energy density of 197 Wh kg&#8208;1 at the power density of 0.641 kW kg&#8208;1. Therefore, this defect engineering method for O d &#8208;VO2 provide an attractive way for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIB cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by aryldiazonium salts and arylazo sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8208;N=N&#8208;SO3Na) were found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8208;Nsp2&#8208; and Au&#8208;Csp2&#8208; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8208;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy) and the Bond Dissociation Energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8208;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8208;N=N&#8208;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced via EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layers films was observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emitters based on multiple resonance (MR) effect have shown great promises for applications in high&#8208;definition displays. Though most reported MR emitters adopt the boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208; doped triangulene&#8208;like skeleton following the design of the DABNA series, MR materials with the nitrogen&#8208;only indolocarbazole structures have recently emerged and demonstrated good color tunability from violet to deep red and impressive electroluminescence performances in terms of both efficiency and stability. Herein, we will summarize indolocarbazole&#8208;based MR materials in recent reports, with emphasis on their molecular design, synthesis, photophysical and electroluminescence properties as well as some future research directions to unlock the full potential of this fascinating class of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision induced dissociation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters containing various uranyl bridging ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We utilized electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ESI&#8208;MS/MS) to study the gas phase fragmentation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters with hydroxo, peroxo, oxalate, and pyrophosphate bridging ligands. These nanoclusters fragment into uranium monomers and dimers with mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge (m/z) ratios in the 280&#8211;380 region. The gas phase fragmentation of each cluster studied yields a distinct UO6&#8211; anion attributed to the cleavage of a uranyl ion bound to 2 peroxide groups, along with other anions that can be attributed to the initial composition of the nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS).However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature.The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8(1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387 K(cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99 K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34 eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29 eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current(2.12&#215;10&#8208;13&#160;A), a high on/off ratio(1.77&#215;103), and a fast response(&#964;rise=125 &#956;s and &#964;decay=419 &#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Energy Transfer and Light&#8208;Emitting Colors by Chiral Dye Exchange and Achiral&#8208;to&#8208;Chiral Dye Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New chiral and achiral dyes were synthesized by using clean, highly efficient Diels&#8208;Alder &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. We prepared pure endo&#8208; and exo&#8208; stereoisomers and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer. 1H NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels&#8208;Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light&#8208;emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, light&#8208;emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene&#8208;to&#8208;dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.e. circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.e. circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
