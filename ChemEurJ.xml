         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Two&#8208;Dimensional Trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based Dion&#8722;Jacobson Hybrid Perovskite toward High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr3  are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic&#8208;layer numbers (n) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (n = 2) CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (n &gt; 2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3  motif, a new Q&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr  3  &#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10  (1, 4&#8208;AMP  2+  = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n = 3), is obtained. Excitingly,  1  exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single&#8208;layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit large on/off ratio (&gt; 10  3  ), high photodetectivity (6.5 &#215; 10&#160;  10  Jones) and fast response speed (193 &#956;s). As far as we know,  1  is the first Q&#8208;2D CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites with high n numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Genuine Pores  in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption  and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores was synthesized by zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] building units assembled into one crystalline structure grown by hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bond to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by cross&#8208;linking of structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding modal to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO  &#8722;  group. Remarkably, this compound demonstrates the highest H  2  storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites) and an excellent CO  2  capture at 298 K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO  2  over H  2  , N  2  , and CO at 298 K were calculated using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Anion&#8722;&#960;+ and &#960;+&#8722;&#960;+ Interactions &#8230;.. Applications in Live Cell Mitochondrial Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependant fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions,  &#960;  +  &#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Inactivation of competitive decay channels leads to enhanced coumarin photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of photolabile protecting groups, it is of high interest to selectively modify photochemical properties with structural changes as simple as possible. In this work, we want to adopt the knowledge of fluorophore optimization and use it to design new coumarin&#8208; based photocages. We selectively modulated the photolysis efficiency by inactivating competitive decay channels, such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) or hydogen&#8208;bonding and demonstrated the photolytic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 led to a significant increase in the uncaging cross section that can be further improved by the simple addition of a double bond. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we gained insights into the underlying solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical dynamics. The chromophores presented here are excellently suited as new photocages in the visible wavelength range due to their simple synthesis and their superior photochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic Cyclobutenes through Desulfinative Spirocyclisation of gem&#8208;Bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes</title>

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Activatable BODIPY and Coumarin 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps for Oligonucleotide Photocaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized two green&#8208;light activatable 5&#8217;&#8208;caps for oligonucleotides based on the BODIPY and coumarin scaffold. Both bear an alkyne functionality allowing their use in numerous biological applications. They were successfully incorporated in oligonucleotides via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using a bisazide photo&#8208;tether gave cyclic oligonucleotides that could be relinearized by activation with green light and were shown to exhibit high stability against exonucleases. Chemical ligation as another example for bioconjugation yielded oligonucleotides with an internal strand break site. Irradiation at 530 nm or 565 nm resulted in complete photolysis of both caging groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad&#8208;spectrum antidote discovery by untangling the reactivation mechanism of nerve agent inhibited acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivators are vital for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication but new alternatives are needed due to their limited clinical applicability. The toxicity of OPNAs stems from covalent inhibition of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which reactivators relieve via a chemical reaction with the inactivated enzyme. Here, we present new strategies and tools for developing reactivators. We discover suitable inhibitor scaffolds by using an activity&#8208;independent competition assay to study non&#8208;covalent interactions with OPNA&#8208;AChEs and transform these inhibitors into broad&#8208;spectrum reactivators. Moreover, we identify determinants of reactivation efficiency by analysing reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics together with structural data. Our results show that new OPNA reactivators can be discovered rationally by exploiting detailed knowledge of the reactivation mechanism of OPNA&#8208;inhibited AChE.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the  P  6  1  chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air stable crystalline form readily obtained from a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH  &#8230;  &#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows a breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and reuptake of water inside the chiral channel, under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively in biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and a total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.</dc:description>

With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and a total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity.

         <title>C&#8211;X Bond Activation by Palladium:&#160; Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8211;H and C(n&#176;)&#8211;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H 3 C&#8211; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH 3 H 2 C&#8211; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH 3 ) 2 HC&#8211; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH 3 ) 3 C&#8211; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. We pinpoint the effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents at the C&#8211;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8211;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bond activation. The C&#8211;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8211;X bond. For the more congested C&#8211;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8211;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticancer Aminoferrocene Derivatives Inducing Production of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual aminoferrocene (AF) agent (3&#8201;d) is reported, which does not react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in contrast to usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g., 3&#8201;b) and exhibits excellent anticancer effects in a variety of cancer cells and in a murine cancer Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) model. The mode of action relies on the increase of the level of mitochondrial ROS (mROS), whereas usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g. 3&#8201;b) do not affect mROS.







Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficient mitochondria are two weak points of cancer cells. Their simultaneous targeting is a valid therapeutic strategy to design highly potent anticancer drugs. The remaining challenge is to limit the drug effects to cancer cells without affecting normal ones. We have previously developed three aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based derivatives, which are activated in the presence of elevated levels of ROS present in cancer cells with formation of electron&#8208;rich compounds able to generate ROS and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). All of them exhibit important drawbacks including either low efficacy or high unspecific toxicity that prevents their application in&#8197;vivo up to date. Herein we describe unusual AF&#8208;derivatives lacking these drawbacks. These compounds act via an alternative mechanism: they are chemically stable in the presence of ROS, generate mitochondrial ROS in cancer cells, but not normal cells and exhibit anticancer effect in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly diverse pyridylated diarylmethanes are rapidly synthesized in metal&#8208;free process mediated by B2pin2/4&#8208;cyanopyridine system. In this reaction, the pyridine&#8208;boryl radical addition to C=O bond of p&#8208;QMs 1 promotes the generation of diarylmethane radicals, which are then coupled with pyridine&#8208;boryl radicals to obtain the desired products 3. The utility of the method was highlighted by biological activity identification.







Abstract
Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs. 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3&#8201;v was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.

&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine-boryl radical induced reductive coupling between &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methides (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-QMs) and 4-cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a templated reagent. The metal-free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2- vs. 1,6-selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross-coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine-boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;v&lt;/b&gt; was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole&#8208;substituted tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical ligands (L1 and L2) were synthesized in a facile way. They are stable and can be used to construct crystalline 1D and 2D open&#8208;shell coordination polymers (CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2) with cobalt(II) ions. Both polymers show antiferromagnetic interaction between carbon&#8208;centered radicals and the high&#8208;spin Co(II) ions.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interactions, but there are only a very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such a purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands L1 and L2 with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. Coordination of L1 and L2 with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208; (CoCP&#8208;1) and two&#8208;dimensional (CoCP&#8208;2) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic cobalt(II) ions and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of a metal&#8211;radical approach toward magnetic materials.

         <title>Orthogonalization of Polyaryl Linkers as a Route to More Porous Phosphonate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonalization of components inhibits efficient packing, whether of bagels or polyaryl linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). This strategy was applied to polyphosphonate linkers to generate six new MOF structures (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39). Ba, Sr, Mg, Zn and two Ca structures were obtained from a new trigonal linker with orthogonal peripheral aryl rings to inhibit efficient packing. The structures are discussed considering their porosity, stability and selective sorption of gases.







Abstract
The coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials often self&#8208;assemble as well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity, as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we report a multistep synthesis of a novel aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker with an orthogonalized ligand core, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2) designed to form more open structures. A series of crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8208;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9&#215;10.1&#8197;&#197;2 square channels. The stability of all structures was tested, and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), was found to retain its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH&#8197;3&#8211;11.

         <title>Conversion of CH4 Catalyzed by Gas Phase Ions Containing Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review article discusses the significant progress that has been made for catalytic methane conversion in the gas phase, with focus on the coupling reactions of CH4 molecules and of CH4 with other substrates (O2, O3, N2O, CO2, and H2O) catalyzed by ions containing metals. The mechanistic details for generation of C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8208;O coupling products from methane have been provided at a strictly molecular level.







Abstract
Methane is an abundant and cheap feedstock to produce valuable chemicals. The catalytic reaction of methane conversion generally requires the participation of multiple molecules (such as two or three CH4 molecules, O2, CO2, etc.). Such complex process includes the cleavage of original chemical bonds, formation of new chemical bonds, and desorption of products. The gas phase study provides a unique arena to gain molecular&#8208;level insights into the detailed mechanisms of bond&#8208;breaking and bond&#8208;forming involved in complicated catalytic reactions. In this Review, we introduce the methane conversion catalyzed by gas phase ions containing metals and three topics will be discussed: (1) the direct coupling of methane molecules, (2) the conversion of CH4 with O2, O3 and N2O, and (3) the conversion of CH4 with CO2 and H2O. The obtained mechanistic aspects may provide new clues for rational design of better&#8208;performing catalysts for conversion of methane to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Site Occupancies, Electron&#8211;Vibration Interaction and Energy Transfer of CaMgSi2O6: Eu2+, Mn2+ Phosphors for Potential Temperature&#8208;Sensing and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Applications</title>

The two&#8208;site occupancies, the electron&#8211;vibration interaction analyses of Mn2+, and the Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer are discussed. The different thermal quenching behaviours and emission colours of Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions in CaMgSi2O6 endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in temperature&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Eu2+&#8208;, Mn2+&#8208; and Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+&#8208;doped CaMgSi2O6 phosphors have been prepared by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction. Systematic investigation of the concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of Mn2+ showed that Mn2+ ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi2O6. Electron&#8211;vibration interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn2+ ions revealed Huang&#8211;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as effective phonon energies of 313 and 383&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for the two sites. Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer is also discussed, and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu2+ and Mn2+, the distinct emission colours of Eu2+ (blue, band peak at &#8764;451&#8197;nm) and Mn2+ (yellow&#8211;red range, band peaks at &#8764;583 and 693&#8197;nm) endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature&#8208;/excitation wavelength&#8208;responsive dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

&lt;p&gt;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped CaMgSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; phosphors have been prepared by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. Systematic investigation of the concentration- and temperature-dependent luminescence of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; showed that Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Electron&#8211;vibration interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions revealed Huang&#8211;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as effective phonon energies of 313 and 383&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the two sites. Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; energy transfer is also discussed, and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the distinct emission colours of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (blue, band peak at &#8764;451&#8197;nm) and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (yellow&#8211;red range, band peaks at &#8764;583 and 693&#8197;nm) endow the co-doped samples with potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature-/excitation wavelength-responsive dual anti-counterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalizing the Aromatic &#948;&#8208;Amino Acid Foldamer Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoline (Q), pyridine (P), and benzene&#8208;based (B) &#948;&#8208;amino acids are shown to be compatible in that sequences comprised of these units generally fold into canonical aromatic helical conformations in water. Exceptions include (P)n and (B)n sequences, but not (PB)n. Helix handedness inversion rates are considerably reduced upon introducing a small proportion of Q monomers. The position of side chains can be modulated upon changing the Q/B ratio.







Abstract
A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility, for example due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and 1H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature, i.&#8201;e. the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp3 centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>The Role of Radical Bridges in Polynuclear Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes, the radical bridge induces crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands. The performance of polynuclear exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs may be significantly enhanced if the crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy induced by the local ligands and the bridging ligands are engineered collinear to each other.







Abstract
Employing radical bridges between anisotropic metal ions has been a viable route to achieve high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While the bridges have been mainly considered for their ability to promote exchange interactions, the crystal&#8208;field effect arising from them has not been taken into account explicitly. This lack of consideration may distort the understanding and limit the development of the entire family. To shed light on this aspect, herein we report a theoretical investigation of a series of N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes. It is found that while promoting strong exchange coupling between the terbium ions, the N
&#8208;radical induces a crystal field that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands, and thus reduces the overall SMM behavior. Based on the theoretical results, we conclude that the SMM behavior in this series could be further maximized if the crystal field of the outer ligands is designed to be collinear with that of the radical bridge. This conclusion can be generalized to all exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs.

         <title>Mesoionic Dithiolates (MIDts) Derived from 1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Anionic Dicarbenes (ADCs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoionic dithiolates Li(MIDts) as well as heteroleptic (MIDt)GeCl and homoleptic (MIDt)2Ge germylenes are reported as crystalline solids. The germylene (MIDt)2Ge features the highest&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and has the smallest HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (2.82&#8197;eV) among the hitherto known germylenes. Insertion of GeCl2 into the Ge&#8722;Cl bond of (MIDt)GeCl affords the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDt)GeGeCl3, a mixed&#8208;valence Ge(+1)/Ge(+3) compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic dithiolates [(MIDtAr)Li(LiBr)2(THF)3] (MIDtAr={SC(NDipp)}2CAr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar=Ph 3&#8201;a, 3&#8208;MeC6H4 (3&#8208;Tol) 3&#8201;b, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) 3&#8201;c) and [(MIDtPh)Li(THF)2] (4) are readily accessible (in&#8805;90&#8201;% yields) as crystalline solids on treatments of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) (2&#8201;a&#8208;c) (ADCAr={C(NDipp)2}2CAr) with elemental sulfur. 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4 are monoanionic ditopic ligands with both the sulfur atoms formally negatively charged, while the 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit bears a formal positive charge. Treatment of 4 with (L)GeCl2 (L=1,4&#8208;dioxane) affords the germylene (MIDtPh)GeCl (5) featuring a three&#8208;coordinated Ge atom. 5 reacts with (L)GeCl2 to give the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDtPh)GeGeCl3 (6). KC8 reduction of 5 yields the homoleptic germylene (MIDtPh)2Ge (7). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4&#8211;7 have been characterized by spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of 4&#8211;7 have been analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Glucosylated 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylpyrimidines as Epigenetic DNA Bases Regulating Transcription and Restriction Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucosylation's glitches: Glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethylpyrimidines were studied as epigenetic DNA modifications that fully inhibit the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. However, only the presence of glucosylated 5hmU inhibited transcription, whereas DNA containing glucosylated 5hmC remained transcriptionally active. This suggests a role for glucosylation by T4 phage &#946;&#8208;glucosyltransferase.







Abstract
5&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine and &#8208;cytidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase&#8208;mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial (Escherichia coli) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in the epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC&#8208;containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glucosylation's glitches&lt;/b&gt;: Glucosylated 5-hydroxymethylpyrimidines were studied as epigenetic DNA modifications that fully inhibit the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. However, only the presence of glucosylated 5hmU inhibited transcription, whereas DNA containing glucosylated 5hmC remained transcriptionally active. This suggests a role for glucosylation by T4 phage &#946;-glucosyltransferase.

&lt;p&gt;5-(&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine and -cytidine 5&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase-mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in the epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites.

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric tuning of two Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers via the tuning of the electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups is reported. The tunable high dielectric properties, wide bandgaps and thermal stability of these CPs clearly demonstrate their potential for use in the design of future gate dielectric materials.







Abstract
The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L1)(L2)]n (1) and [Zn(L1)(L3)]n (2) [L1=2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl) benzimidazole (Pbim), L2=5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L3=5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of 1 revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954;=65.5 at 1&#8197;kHz), while compound 2 displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954;=110.3 at 1&#8197;kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH2 and NO2 substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO2 and NH2. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.

         <title>A Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Boryl&#8208;Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What hides within: Three different singlet boryl phosphinidenes were synthesized by using cAAC carbene, and their inversely polarized phosphaalkene characteristics were investigated. Quantum mechanical studies suggest that the P center of these boryl phosphinidenes contains two lone pairs viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis and characterization of the carbene&#8208;stabilized boryl phosphinidenes 1&#8211;3 are reported. Compounds 1&#8211;3 are obtained by reacting Me&#8208;cAAC=PK (Me2&#8208;cAAC=dimethyl cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) and dihaloaryl borane in toluene. All three compounds were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicated that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P center viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the &#960;&#8208;type lone pair is higher than the &#963;&#8208;type lone pair.

         <dc:description>We report a facile strategy to prepare a large amount of ultrathin graphdiyne (GDY) with good crystallinity in the mixture of oil&#8208;water systems. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl  3  and the copper acetate solution as a catalyst in water and stirring at room temperature, ultrathin GDY films with a thickness of ~4 nm were obtained in a yield of 95%. This work provides a feasible path for the substantial preparation of GDY films and may pave the way to the development of substantial preparation of the GDY materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is a promising strategy to store solar energy in the form of green hydrogen, but its hydrogen generation efficiency is still low despite years of research. Graphene has attracted great attention in solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting because it has quite versatile properties and is able to act as photo harvester, electron mediator and cocatalyst in a photocatalysis system. Herein, a review of graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials for solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is presented. The review starts from two commonly&#8208;used methods, photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and the fundamentals of these two methods. The approaches for the preparation of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes containing graphene are presented and the roles of graphene are discussed. Accordingly, the challenges and prospects of the future applications of graphene in solar&#8208;driven water splitting are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming of Singlet Oxygen: Towards Artificial Oxygen Carriers based on 1,4&#8208;Dialkylnaphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalene endoperoxides are known as convenient sources of singlet oxygen (O 2 , 1 &#916; g ) which is the major product of endoperoxide cycloreversion reaction. However, their potential as carriers of ground state molecular oxygen (O 2 , 3 &#931; g ) similar to artificial oxygen carriers remain largely unexplored. This is due to the extreme reactivity and cytotoxic effects of the released singlet oxygen. We now report that a compound with a bimodular design, which incorporates an endoperoxide and an efficient physical quencher of singlet oxygen, DABCO, produces exclusively ground state molecular oxygen. This result, coupled with the fact that oxygen release rates from endoperoxides are highly amenable to fine tuning in a very broad range, and open to targeting by ligand attachment, raises the potential of these compounds far above any comparable chemical, or even biochemical sources. In cell culture experiments, we showed that the addition of the endoperoxide&#8208;quencher conjugate can enhance and sustain cell proliferation.</dc:description>

         <title>A new look at molecular and electronic structure of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8208;bidentate ligands: Combined experimental and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paddlewheel&#8208;type dinuclear complexes featuring metal&#8211;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.e. switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Interestingly, the Mayer bond orders for the Fe&#8208;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse supports for immobilization of catalysts in continuous flow reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.</dc:description>

         <title>New Materials formed by combining Inorganic Glasses and Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining glassy or crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with inorganic glasses to create novel hybrid composites and blends is proposed. The motivation behind this new composite approach is to improve the processability issues and mechanical performance of MOFs, whilst maintaining their ubiquitous properties. Herein, the precepts of successful composite formation and pairing of MOF and glass MOFs with inorganic glasses are presented. Focus is also given to the synthetic routes to such materials and the challenges anticipated in both their production and characterisation. Depending on their chemical nature, materials are classified as crystalline MOF&#8208;glass composites and blends. Additionally, the potential properties and applications of these two classes of materials are considered, the key aim being the retention of beneficial properties of both components, whilst circumventing their respective drawbacks.</dc:description>

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP).&#160; The tool consists of 3  10  helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers.&#160; With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively.&#160; Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting.&#160; Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency.&#160; These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Properties of 5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;Nitramino&#8208;tetrazoles by Diverse Functionalization &#8211; General Concepts for Future Energetic Materials</title>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole backbones are established heterocyclic motifs in the research field of energetic materials synthesis. Despite the high energy content of the compounds, the problem with many derivatives is that their sensitivities are far too high. Functionalization of one of the ring nitrogen atoms is the aim of this study to adjust the sensitivity by inserting nitratoethyl, azidoethyl and methyl groups. In this context, derivatives of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;nitraminotetrazoles (  2  ,  2a  &#8208;  2d  ), as well as 1&#8208;nitrato and 1&#8208;azidoethyl substituted 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (  7  and  10  ) and the methylation products of 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (5&#8208;azido&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole,  11  and 5&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole,  12  ) were prepared. The obtained nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds were extensively characterized through multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The structural confinement was checked by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The pure samples (verified by elemental analysis) were investigated regarding their behavior toward friction, impact (BAM methods) and electrostatic discharge as well as heating (DTA and DSC). For all metal&#8208;free compounds the detonation properties were computed with the EXPLO5 code using their density and heat of formation, calculated based on CBS&#8208;4M level of theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Control of Microbial Movement by Photoswitchable ATP Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized compounds acting as antagonists of ATP and whose activity is reversibly changed by light. When the compound was given to a microorganism moving by flagella, the movement could be changed significantly and reversibly by alternating irradiation of two wavelengths. This means that we can freely control the ATP world that governs the energy flow of living things.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonists showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an in&#8197;vitro dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the trans and cis photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found that the trans and cis isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.

The new ATP antagonists showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an in&#8197;vitro dynein-microtubule system due to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt;. We found that the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Light to Structure: Photo Initiators for Radical Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon polymerization has established itself as one of the most important techniques for the fabrication of 3D structures in the micro to nanometer range. To ensure precise and rapid fabrication, photo initiators (PI) are used that have been specially developed for this purpose. In this review article, the PIs known to the literature are listed and compared in particular according to their structural elements, fabrication behavior and two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three&#8208;dimensional structures on a micro&#8208; and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, in this review the class of two&#8208;photon photo initiators (2PI) used for radical polymerization is discussed in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two&#8208;photon cross sections (&#963;TPA) as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, etc.). Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.

         <title>Macrocyclic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Composed of Oligothiophene Half&#8208;Cycles and Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide dyes bridged by &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units is described. Next to panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, the compounds show donor bridge size&#8208;dependent electronic properties and excited state dynamics.







Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) macrocyclic dyads consisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothiophene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle. Investigation of the excited state dynamics revealed an oligothiophene bridge size&#8208;dependent fast charge transfer process for the macrocyclic dyads upon PBI subunit excitation.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid&#8208;State and Solution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the solid state, due to Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions, diaryl ditellurides are facing to each other, like these &#8220;solid/frozen&#8221; Scottish cows in winter. Once the molecules are &#8220;defrosted&#8221; in solution, new interactions occur with soluble Lewis bases, including some solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by Patrick Pale, V. Mamane and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200395).

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Thermal Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Aluminophosphate Zeotype via Self&#8208;Assembly of Double&#8208;Four&#8208;Ring Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis method was developed to prepare extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1, unravelling its crystallization process via self&#8208;assembly of d4r unit, an intermediate formed at synthesis conditions of low water content in presence of a template structure with alkyl chains of proper length. This new synthesis strategy is suitable for rational preparation of d4r&#8208;containing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolitic materials in the absence of Ge.







Abstract
The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra&#8208;large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular&#8208;level mechanism study of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1 with &#8208;CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge&#8208;free extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeotypes based on d4r route.

         <title>On the Mediated Electron Transfer of Immobilized Galactose Oxidase for Biotechnological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrical wiring of galactose oxidase with a redox polymer is proven to support bio&#8208;electrocatalytic conversions with minimal interference from O2, thereby enabling the oxidation of primary alcohols while decreasing the associated production of harmful H2O2. A practical example is shown for the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable substrates. Product evaluation is used to investigate whether or not carboxylic acid derivatives are obtained after accumulation of the aldehyde product in the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transformations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We have investigated the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer; this enables mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface for its potential application in biotechnological conversions. As a result of electrochemical regeneration of the catalytic center, the formation of harmful H2O2 is minimized during enzymatic catalysis. The introduced bioelectrode was applied to the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable platform materials, with glycerol as model substrate. The biocatalytic transformations of glycerol and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated in a circular flow&#8208;through setup to assess the possibility of substrate over&#8208;oxidation, which is observed for glycerol oxidation but not during HMF conversion.

As a result of electrochemical regeneration of the catalytic center, the formation of harmful H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is minimized during enzymatic catalysis. The introduced bioelectrode was applied to the conversion of bio-renewable platform materials, with glycerol as model substrate. The biocatalytic transformations of glycerol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated in a circular flow-through setup to assess the possibility of substrate over-oxidation, which is observed for glycerol oxidation but not during HMF conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical cis&#8211;trans isomerization was used to switch a divalent lectin ligand between its two forms, which show contrasting binding properties to the plant lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), as visualized by the yin&#8208;yang symbol. Whereas the E isomer (obtained under irradiation with green light) is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a high&#8208;affinity chelating binding mode, the Z isomer (obtained under UV light irradiation) crosslinks two lectin molecules associated with a much lower binding affinity. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Wittmann and co&#8208;authors (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200267).

         <title>Azetidines&#8208;Containing Fluorescent Purine Analogs: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogues of N,N&#8208;dimethyladenine exploiting both thieno&#8208;and isothiazolo&#8208;pyrimidine cores were modified with 3&#8208;subsituted azetidines to yield visibly emissive and responsive fluorophores. Ribosylation of the difluoroazetidino&#8208;modified nucleobase yielded an emissive nucleoside that displayed a substantially lower emission quantum yield in water, compared to the precursor nucleobase. The impact of the sugar moiety on the photophysical features of fluorescent nucleosides, a functionality usually considered non&#8208;chromophoric and photophysically benign, was analyzed.







Abstract
Analogues of N,N&#8208;dimethyladenine exploiting both thieno&#8208;and isothiazolo&#8208;pyrimidine cores were modified with 3&#8208;subsituted azetidines to yield visibly emissive and responsive fluorophores. The emission quantum yields, among the highest seen for purine analogues (0.64 and 0.77 in water and dioxane respectively), correlated with the Hammett inductive constants of the substituents on the azetidine ring. Ribosylation of the difluoroazetidino&#8208;modified nucleobase yielded an emissive nucleoside that displayed a substantially lower emission quantum yield in water, compared to the precursor nucleobase. Importantly, high emission quantum yield was restored in deuterium oxide, which highlights the potential impact of the sugar moiety on the photophysical features of fluorescent nucleosides, a functionality usually considered non&#8208;chromophoric and photophysically benign.

         <title>2,3&#8208;Disubstituted fluorene scaffold for efficient green phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24% EQE and 104 lm W  &#8208;1  power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Planarized Phenyldithienylboranes: Effects of the Bridging Moieties and&#160;&#960;&#8208;Extension on the Photophysical Properties and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two kinds of planarized phenyldithienylboranes, which contain (CH  3  )  2  C&#8208; or CH  2  bridging moieties, were synthesized. The difference of the bridging moieties affects their &#160; packing structures&#160;and photophysical properties. In particular, the&#160;(CH  3  )  2  C&#8208;bridged derivative exhibits a large Stokes shift, unusual for such planarized compounds, that results from&#160;a large&#160;structural relaxation in the excited state. A series of&#160;&#960;&#8208;extended derivatives was synthesized, among&#160;which a&#160;  p  &#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl&#8208;substituted&#160;derivative shows&#160;large solvatochromism in the fluorescence spectra, while maintaining high quantum yields even in polar solvents. The Lewis acidity of the phenyldithienylborane derivatives was also assessed by titration with pyridine.&#160;The Lewis acidity of the&#160;boron center&#160;is affected not only by the difference in the steric bulk of the bridging moieties, but also by&#160;the electronic effect of the substituents introduced at remote positions relative to the boron atom. These results demonstrate the&#160;characteristic features of planarized&#160;phenyldithienylboranes as building blocks for boron&#8208;based&#160;&#960;&#8208;electron materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The effects of spin&#8211;orbit coupling on the HA&#8211;LA bond&#8230; could have significant consequences for the molecular sciences and the design of new materials.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200277).







Abstract
Radek Marek and his co&#8208;workers at Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia have been invited to prepare the cover of this issue. The image depicts the relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling that is associated with the presence of a heavy atom in a molecule influencing the electron density around a light atom and modulating the chemical bond between these two atoms.

         <title>&#173;Sunlight&#8208;Induced In Situ Isomerization of Both Ligands in a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Coordination Polymer: From Photosalient to Photoinert Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of Zn(NO3)2&#183;6H2O, maleic acid (H2mal) and trans&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (trans&#8208;nvp) in the dark results the formation of one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (1D CP) [Zn(mal)(trans&#8208;nvp)] (1), which is photosalient in nature. The crystals of 1 pop violently under UV light and moderately in sunlight, and generate cyclobutane ligand. However, the same reaction mixture kept in visible light exhibits rare example of in situ isomerization of both the ligands: cis&#8208;trans transformation of maleate and trans&#8208;cis isomerization of nvp ligands, and subsequent formation of another 1D CP [Zn(fum)(cis&#8208;nvp)2(H2O)2] (2, H2fum = fumaric acid), which is found to be photoinert. Thus, altering the reaction condition from dark to visible light gives rise to photosalient to photoinert crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here we introduce the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allows for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification  via  Ugi reaction barely varies the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive property in contrast to the dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies, sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Study: Importance of Detergent Core Flexibility in Protein Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem triazine&#8208;based maltoside with the ethylene diamine linker (i.&#8201;e., TZM&#8722;E9) conferred markedly enhanced stability to the tested membrane proteins compared to the hydrazine linker analog and the conventional dodecyl maltoside (DDM): prokaryotic leucine transporter (LeuT), human &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR), and mouse &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR). The favorable behaviors of this detergent for membrane protein stability are mainly due to its foldable nature, originating from the flexible ethylene diamine linker present between the two triazine units.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools are suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8722;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8722;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8722;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8722;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8722;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential in rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.

         <title>Structure Engineering of BiSbSx Nanocrystals Embedded within Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Fibers for High Performance of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BiSbSx@sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (BiSbSx@SPAN) composite is fabricated through electrospinning followed by sulfuration treatment. When employed as an anode of PIBs, it maintains a large reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance (472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next&#8208;generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large&#8208;sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+ to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an excellent reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles) and 472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibers.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions Using Air as Sole Oxidant**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbon&#8722;heteroatom bond formations using air as sole oxidant provide a variety of oxygenated and aminated arylamines as well as aminated phenols. The appropriate additive (Br&#248;nsted acid, Lewis acid, or base) is crucial for these couplings. The mild oxidative reaction proceeds at room temperature and represents a powerful alternative to traditional carbon&#8722;heteroatom couplings.







Abstract
We describe the oxygenation of tertiary arylamines, and the amination of tertiary arylamines and phenols. The key step of these coupling reactions is an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond formation which generally provides the corresponding products in high yields and with excellent regioselectivity. The transformations are accomplished using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8722;iron(II) (FePcF16) as catalyst in the presence of an acid or a base additive and require only ambient air as sole oxidant.

The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208; and [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated and pre&#8208;generated ketenes with azomethine imines is described.

Abstract
A versatile asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208; and [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of ketenes with azomethine imines is described. The methodology was found to be tolerant of ketene and a variety of monosubstituted ketenes (R=alkyl, OAc). The products were formed in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;99&#8201;% for 24 examples, 39 examples in all), with good to excellent diastereoselectivity in many cases (dr 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 27&#8201;:&#8201;1 for 22 examples), and with excellent enantioselectivity for most examples (&#8805;93&#8201;% ee for 34 products). In the case of most disubstituted ketenes, the reaction proceeded through a [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition to form structurally interesting bicyclic pyrazolo&#8208;oxadiazepinediones with moderate diastereoselectivity (dr up to 3.7&#8201;:&#8201;1) and as racemic mixtures (3 examples). The method represents the first unambiguous example of an enantioselective reaction between ketenes and a 1,3&#8208;dipole.

         <title>Insights into the Electronic Structure of a U(IV) Amido and U(V) Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the compound [U(V)(TMSI)Cl5], uranium could be stabilized in the rare +V oxidation state proven by HERFD XANES measurements. In the complex, an inverse trans influence (ITI) was uncovered. Quantum chemical calculations show this effect to be dependent on the electronic situation on the metal centre, thus increasing with higher oxidation state.







Abstract
Reaction of the N&#8208;heterocylic carbene ligand iPrIm (L1) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (TMSA) as a base with UCl4 resulted in U(IV) and U(V) complexes. Uranium's +V oxidation state in (HL1)2[U(V)(TMSI)Cl5] (TMSI=trimethylsilylimido) (2) was confirmed by HERFD&#8208;XANES measurements. Solid state characterization by SC&#8208;XRD and geometry optimisation of [U(IV)(L1)2(TMSA)Cl3] (1) indicated a silylamido ligand mediated inverse trans influence (ITI). The ITI was examined regarding different metal oxidation states and was compared to transition metal analogues by theoretical calculations.

Molecular fishing: Quantum chemical calculations show the potential of several carbene&#8208;stabilized borylenes in capturing dinitrogen either as a borylene mono&#8208;adduct or as a bridging entity by two borylene moieties







Abstract
Computational investigations were carried out to probe the potential of several dicoordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes of the form [L&#8594;BR] (L=neutral Lewis base) in dinitrogen binding. The calculated reaction free energies and activation barriers associated with the formation of mono&#8208; and diborylene&#8208;N2 adducts suggest the presence of thermally surmountable kinetic barriers towards their possible isolation. Our results show that the exergonicity of dinitrogen activation and fixation is linearly dependent on the natural charge at the boron center, which can be tuned to design novel boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications to small&#8208;molecule activation. EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis reveals strong binding of dinitrogen to these base&#8208;stabilized borylenes.

         <title>Expanded Mercaptocalixarenes: A New Kind of Macrocyclic Ligands for Stabilization of Polynuclear Thiolate Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of expanded mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which four 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;thiophenolato units are joined by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NR(CH2)3NRCH2&#8722; linkers, has been achieved. The new macrocycles do not show the conformational isomerism typical of the parent mercaptocalix[4]arenes. The potential of these macrocycles to form mixed&#8208;ligand complexes with first row&#8208;transition metal ions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The syntheses and properties of expanded 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; or &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NRCH2CH2CH2NRCH2&#8722; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step&#8208;wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.&#8201;e. S&#8208;alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation&#8208;sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (6, 7, 11) afforded the free thiophenols (H48, H49, and H412) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3&#8208;alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macrocycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synthesis of&lt;/b&gt; expanded mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which four 4-tert-butyl-thiophenolato units are joined by &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NRCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; and &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NRCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; linkers, has been achieved. The new macrocycles do not show the conformational isomerism typical of the parent mercaptocalix[4]arenes. The potential of these macrocycles to form mixed-ligand complexes with first row-transition metal ions is demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntheses and properties of expanded 4-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NRCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; or &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NRCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; and &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NRCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NRCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step-wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.&#8201;e. &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation-sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;) afforded the free thiophenols (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3-alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macrocycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water**

         <dc:description>
Selective ferric ions detection has been carried out with systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs. Among them, al the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions.







Abstract
The potential emergence of fluorescence&#8208;based techniques has propelled research towards developing probes that can sense trace metal ions specifically. Although luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are well suited for this application, the role of building blocks towards detection is not fully understood. In this work, a systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites is carried out in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs, and targeting a model metal ion&#8208;Fe3+. All the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO&#8208;67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe3+ ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO&#8208;67@N based mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe3+ ions detection in water.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaromatization Route to Cycloparaphenylenes that Exhibit Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes via the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylenes with monoynes. The thus obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes, exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and are noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have ordinally AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenyl&#8208;ethene and benzene skeletons.







Abstract
A high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes has been developed via reductive aromatization of a diyne bearing two cyclohexadiene units giving a cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylene (CPE) followed by the cationic rhodium(I)/dppe complex&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition (cycloaromatization) of the CPE with monoynes. The thus&#8208;obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes ([8]CPPTs), exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). This molecule is noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have well&#8208;known AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenylethene and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene skeletons. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of the AIE&#8208;active [8]CPPTs revealed their highly ordered packing structures in which the rotation of the triphenylene moieties is restricted.

A Cu(I)/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of polyfluoroaryl allenyl sulfides with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, generating chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides in good enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is reported, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;diazoester has also been demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Oxidation of BINOLs by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: Facile Synthesis of Xanthenes and Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of BINOLs promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents is leading to binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthenes and to nine&#8208;membered lactones in high yields. In the presence of alcohols this method provides a new strategy for the synthesis of alkoxylated xanthene derivatives.







Abstract
Xanthene derivatives have broad applications in medicines, fluorescent probes, dyes, food additives, etc. Therefore, much attention was focused on developing the synthetic methods to prepare these compounds. Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodoxybenzene (PhIO2) was used. Additionally, one&#8208;pot reactions of BINOLs, PhIO and nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines were also investigated to provide alkoxylated products and amides in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Thiourea&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Substituted Benzoxadiazole Dyes with Large Stokes Shifts as Red&#8208;Emitting Probe Monomers for Imprinted Polymer Layers Targeting Carboxylate&#8208;Containing Antibiotics</title>

Signalling in the red, when antibiotics are bound to novel dual functional donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted benzoxadiazole probes with unprecedented large Stokes shifts, containing a benzoylthiourea receptor for carboxylate binding and a tertiary amine&#8208;appended methacrylate linker for covalent matrix incorporation. The selective binding of a model antibiotic enoxacin is achieved by the integration of the polymerizable probes into molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) shells on submicron silica particles, the dyes retaining their red&#8208;shifted emission based on two concerted intramolecular charge transfer processes.







Abstract
Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250&#8197;nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700&#8197;nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes through its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.

         <title>Front Cover: Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding (Chem. Eur. J. 21/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Despite decades of intense research, metal&#8208;free binding of N2 is still a tantalizing goal. We have computationally explored di&#8208;coordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes as candidates for N2 capture. Besides identifying key borylene&#8211;N2 adducts with low activation barriers, we reveal that the reaction exergonicity is linearly dependent on the natural charge at boron. These findings pave the way for the design of boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications in small&#8208;molecule activation. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fantuzzi, H. Braunschweig, A.&#8197;K. Phukan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104123). Cover designed by F.F.

         <title>Cover Feature: Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water (Chem. Eur. J. 21/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the organic building units of MOFs towards selective detection of a targeted metal cation (Fe3+) has been demonstrated by systematic screening by varying the number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). All three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present a quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water; however, only UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas the emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;K. Ghosh et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104175).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By encapsulating various designable molecules in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), the proton conductivity of composites can be improved. Here we classify these designable molecules into four types, and discuss the effect of their introduction on the improvement of the proton conductivity of MOFs. We hope to provide some feasible guidance for the design and development of future composite proton&#8208;conducting materials for MOFs encapsulating guest molecules. For more details, see the Review by C.&#8208;X. Zhang, Q.&#8208;L. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103732).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) are valuable biocatalyst that engages in stereospecific reduction of activated C=C bonds and exhibit increased prominence in the production of pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemical synthons, and fine chemicals. In addition to traditional biocatalysis, ERs evolved in multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, chemoenzymatic, photoenzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single&#8208;reduction chemistry, and radical&#8208;mediated transformation which unravels its versatility and multifaceted nature in organic transformations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ene-reductases&lt;/b&gt; (ERs) are valuable biocatalyst that engages in stereospecific reduction of activated C=C bonds and exhibit increased prominence in the production of pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemical synthons, and fine chemicals. In addition to traditional biocatalysis, ERs evolved in multi-enzyme cascades, chemoenzymatic, photoenzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single-reduction chemistry, and radical-mediated transformation which unravels its versatility and multifaceted nature in organic transformations.

How to welcome guests: In this review, we summarize the current strategies for introducing guest molecules into MOFs to improve their proton conductivity, and divide the guest molecules into four types. We also present the challenges and prospects of applying this strategy for these solid proton conducting materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a porous frame material, exhibit considerable electrical conductivity. In recent decades, research on the proton conductivity of MOFs has made gratifying progress. In this review, the designable guest molecules encapsulated into MOFs are summarized and generalized into four types in terms of promoting proton conductive performance, and then recent progress in the promotion of proton conductivity by MOFs encapsulating guest molecules is discussed. The existing challenges and prospects for the development of this strategy for promoting MOFs&#8217; proton conductivity are also listed.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase: A Multifaceted Biocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 21, April 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) are a promising biocatalyst that reduces unsaturated double bonds cooperatively with transition metals, besides they are amiable with other emergent techniques like photoenzymatic, chemoenzymatic, multi&#8208;enzymatic, photoelectrochemical, single reduction chemistry, and radical&#8208;mediated transformations. These techniques will influence the enzymologist and synthetic chemist to explore and expand the intriguing chemistries displayed by ERs for academic and industrial purposes.







Abstract
Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. The saturation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds by biocatalysts challenges the conventional chemical methodology as it bypasses the use of precious metals (in combination with chiral ligands and molecular hydrogen) or organocatalysts. In this line, Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) family are found to be a prominent asymmetric biocatalyst that is increasingly used in academia and industries towards unparalleled stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrogenations of activated C=C bonds. ERs gained prominence as they were used as individual catalysts, multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, and in conjugation with chemical reagents (chemoenzymatic approach). Besides, ERs&#8217; participation in the photoelectrochemical and radical&#8208;mediated process helps to unlock many scopes outside traditional biocatalysis. These up&#8208;and&#8208;coming methodologies entice the enzymologists and chemists to explore, expand and harness the chemistries displayed by ERs for industrial settings. Herein, we reviewed the last five year's exploration of organic transformations using ERs.

         <title>Direct in situ vertical growth of interlaced mesoporous NiO nanosheets on carbon felt for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1cat.) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9% at &#8208;0.5 V vs RHE) in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15 nm and the thickness of ~30 nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principle calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960;&#160;interactions between a noble metal and a polyfunctional aromatic ligand: Ag+(benzylamine)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of an isolated Ag  +  (benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation&#8208;N and cation&#8208;&#960;&#160;interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8208;1800 cm  &#8208;1  fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT&#8208;ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d&#8217;Orsay (CLIO). The resulting IRMPD pattern points toward a chelate coordination (N&#8208;Ag  +  &#8208;&#960;) involving both the amino nitrogen atom and the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system of the phenyl ring. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag  +  (benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion Ag  +  (benzylamine)(L).</dc:description>

The gas-phase reactivity of Ag  +  (benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N- and &#960;-binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion Ag  +  (benzylamine)(L).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical solution: Single&#8208;molecular conductances were compared between methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound on porphyrin template by STM apparent height measurement. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference, despite the fact that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to be distributed on the wire moiety.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without a radical substituent has been compared. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto a porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent&#8208;height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and octan&#8208;1&#8208;oic acid. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7&#8208;fold higher conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;responsive Phenthiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;related Dual Emission and High&#8208;contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, facile synthetic procedure and good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt; 100 nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission character and emit room temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli endows them promising applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus enable to shield of the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows the selectivity transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completed encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular engineering of star&#8208;shaped indoline hole transport materials: The influence of planarity on the hole extraction and transport processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM's HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48%, which is higher than that of spiro  &#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us a promising strategy for the further optimization of efficient HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Isolation of A Labile Silylated Hydrazinium&#8208;yl Radical Cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3]&#8226;+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8208;N(H)SiMe3]&#8226;+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8211;40 &#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8208;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8211;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8208;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 frame&#173;work in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8208;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960; bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a 3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron 2&#8208;center bond.</dc:description>

In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8211;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium-yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N-N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 frame&#173;work in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N-N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960; bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a 3-&#960;-electron 2-center bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;US"&gt;Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, we compare the synthetic protocols and properties of two types of carbon nitride materials &amp;ndash; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &amp;ndash; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. We obtain melem hydrate as single&#8208;crystalline powders and compare it with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, we rationalize the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic &lt;italic&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt;via&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt; density functional theory calculations. &lt;/span&gt;This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>GNPS**&#8208;guided discovery of madurastatins A1, A2, E1, F, and G1, siderophores from the termite&#8208;associated Actinomadura sp. RB99</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we analyzed if  Actinomadura  sp. RB99 produces siderophores that that could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in co&#8208;cultivation studies. Dereplication of high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and global natural product social molecular networking platform (GNPS) analysis of fungus&#8208;bacterium co&#8208;cultures resulted in the identification of five madurastatin derivatives (A1, A2, E1, F, and G1), of which were four new derivatives. Chemical structures were unambiguously confirmed by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS data and their absolute structures were elucidated based on Marfey&#8217;s analysis, DP4+ probability calculation and total synthesis. Structure analysis revealed that madurastatin E1 (  2  ) contained a rare 4&#8208;imidazolidinone cyclic moiety and madurastatin A1 (  5  ) was characterized as a Ga  3+  &#8208;complex. The function of madurastatins as siderophores was evaluated using the fungal pathogen  Cryptococcus neoformans  as model organism. Based on homology models, we identified the putative NRPS&#8208;based gene cluster region of the siderophores in  Actinomadura  sp. RB99.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial charge modulation via in&#8208;situ fabrication of 3D conductive platform with MOF nanoparticles for photocatalytic reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO  2  into valuable carbon&#8208;contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO  2  stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO  2  reduction by assembling three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal&#8208;organic framework material UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been promoted for the composite materials than that of the pure UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  . Further mechanism investigations proved the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO  2  absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , respectively. This study may furnish a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Copper Phthalocyanine Nanoparticles as Highly Sensitive Sensor for Colorimetric Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors to detect biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct polymeric materials as highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, here, we report to design the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88 &#956;M for the H  2  O  2  , 4.27 &#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10 &#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, excessive salts, etc. This highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticle not only overcomes the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provides a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Dual Phosphorescence from (o&#8208;Bromophenyl)&#8208;Bis(2,6&#8208;Dimethylphenyl)Borane at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208;triarylborane o&#8208;BrTAB exhibits dual phosphorescence at room temperature; a short&#8208;lived higher energy emission originates from single molecules (T1M) whereas the long&#8208;lived component at lower energy results from an aggregate (T1A). Under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB emits bright pale blue light (fluorescence). After turning off the light, a persistent yellow afterglow remains for 2&#8197;s.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (o, m, p&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (o&#8208;, m&#8208; and p&#8208;BrTAB) synthesized, the ortho&#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8&#8197;ms and a long lifetime of 234&#8197;ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of o&#8208;BrTAB, the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T1M state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T1A state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline o&#8208;BrTAB inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;anomeric stereoauxiliary strategy for the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine was achieved through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition&#8208;state intermediate and the simultaneous incorporation of amine moieties in imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This method provides a novel strategy for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage and unlocks efficient access to diverse imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines blocks bearing versatile functional groups.







Abstract
The targeted cleavage of the C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass according to a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage via a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. By using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (&gt;80 examples) was synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.

         <title>Superassembled Hierarchical Asymmetric Magnetic Mesoporous Nanorobots Driven by Smart Confined Catalytic Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Set in motion: A hierarchical, asymmetric, magnetic, mesoporous, hollow nanorobot was constructed according to a sequential, interfacial superassembly strategy. This nanorobot integrated magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion, recyclability into a single system; this not only sets a platform for manipulating its motion, but also provides a promising tool for various future applications.







Abstract
Micro/nanoscale robotics has received great attention in many important fields. However, it is still a great challenge to construct nanorobots simultaneously possessing multifunctionality, well&#8208;controlled directionality, and fast and durable motion as well as fully compatible and biodegradable components. Here, a hierarchical, asymmetric, hollow, catalytic, magnetic, and mesoporous nanorobot has been fabricated through a multistep interfacial superassembly strategy. The multilayer composites consist of hollow silica nanoflasks sequentially coated with a highly magnetic responsive Fe3O4 layer, a mesoporous silica layer with homogeneous vertical channels, and a layer of catalytic gold nanoparticles on both the inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, para&#8208;nitrophenol was used as a model pollutant to trigger self&#8208;motility of the nanoflasks by confined catalytic degradation (CCD). We found that the bottleneck morphology and mesoporous surface both improved the catalytic nanoparticle loading capability and CCD effect, thus enabling efficient self&#8208;motility and a durable movement capacity of &#8764;100&#8197;h. In addition, the catalytic performance was improved by 180&#8201;% compared with that of solid spherical nanoparticles.

         <title>Zwitterionic Block Copolymers for the Synthesis and Stabilization of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is enabled by replacing conventional small molecule ligands with zwitterion&#8208;containing block copolymers (BCPs) that are soluble in liquid phases useful for hot injection PNC syntheses. PNCs prepared in this manner are obtained in high yields with bright photoluminescence, with the zwitterionic BCPs facilitating efficient PNC isolation, long&#8208;term stability, and direct conversion to nanocomposite films.







Abstract
Traditional hot injection methods for the preparation of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 PNCs, where X=Cl, Br, or I) rely on small molecule surfactants to produce PNCs with cube, plate, or rod&#8208;like morphologies. Here, we describe a new method whereby zwitterionic block copolymers are employed as macromolecular ligands in PNC synthesis, affording PNCs with excellent colloidal stability, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and in some cases distinctly non&#8208;cubic shapes. The block copolymers used in this study &#8211; composed of a poly(n&#8208;butyl methacrylate) hydrophobic block and zwitterionic methacrylate hydrophilic blocks &#8211; dissolve in useful solvents for PNC growth despite containing large mole percentages of zwitterionic groups. PNCs prepared with block copolymer ligands were found to disperse and retain their fluorescence in a range of polar organic solvents and were amenable to direct integration into optically transparent nanocomposite thin films with high PNC content.

A &#956;&#8208;amido complex was obtained by the reaction of a dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring with NH3. Subsequent treatment with base caused C&#8722;N bond formation, yielding a &#956;3&#8208;azaruthenacyclopentadienyl complex. The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of a mono&#8208;cationic analogue in an NH3 atmosphere, in which the C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring







Abstract
A dicationic triruthenium complex containing a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3 ring, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3MeH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;H)]2+ (1&#8201;a, Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), reacted with ammonia to yield a &#956;&#8208;amido complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;CHCMeCH) (&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;&#8208;NH2)]2+ (5), via N&#8722;H bond scission. Subsequent treatment with base resulted in C&#8722;N bond formation to yield a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;1&#8208;azabutadien&#8208;4&#8208;yl complex, [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;NH=CH&#8722;CMe=CH&#8722;)]+ (6&#8201;a). The azaruthenacyclopentadiene skeleton was alternatively synthesized by the photolysis of mono&#8208;cationic complex [(Cp*Ru)3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;C3RH2&#8722;)(&#956;3&#8208;CH)]+ (2&#8201;a; R=Me, 2&#8201;b; R=H) in the presence of ammonia. The C3 ring skeleton was broken via the electron transfer to the &#960;*(C&#8722;C) orbital in the C3 ring, and a transiently generated unsaturated &#956;3&#8208;allylic species can take up ammonia, resulting in N&#8722;H bond scission followed by C&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Optimization of an Asymmetric Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Held in place: Aromatic oligoamide sequences can regulate the stereochemistry of an asymmetric reaction in helical cavities. The modular construction design of the sequences confers the ease of sequential modification, whereby the diastereoselectivity of the asymmetric reaction significantly increases with diastereomeric excess from 9 to 90&#8201;% after a few progressive optimizations.







Abstract
An asymmetric reaction can be implemented and refined in the helical cavity of aromatic oligoamide sequences. These sequences, which bear a chiral inducer, can fold into helical structures with absolute control of the helical sense, whereby a ketone substrate covalently linked in the cavity can be asymmetrically reduced to diastereomers. The diastereoselectivity of the reduction is highly dependent on the shielding efficiency of the helical cavity. Iterative modifications of the sequence, such as addition and replacement of monomers, can fine&#8208;tune the cavity to realize the asymmetric reaction, thereby progressively increasing the diastereomeric excess up to 90&#8201;%.

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of structural defects in the crystal lattice of the microporous UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework affects the adsorption and separation of constitutional isomers of hexane. Experimental adsorption isobars were recreated using Monte Carlo molecular modelling in order to fully understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level.







Abstract
In this work, adsorption properties of the UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual &#8220;reverse&#8221; selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs**

Crystal chameleons: Sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) composed of a 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted C=C bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. Their solid&#8208;state energy landscapes show the presence of metastable intermediate crystals corresponding to conformations with different folds, twists and dihedral angles. Moreover, these FAE crystals have different absorption and emission colors from yellow to dark red that change in response to external stimuli, such as grinding, pressure, and heating.







Abstract
Overcrowded ethylenes composed of 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted carbon&#8211;carbon double (C=C) bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. As such, they are unique frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs). Various colored crystals of these FAEs, obtained in different solvents, correspond to multiple metastable conformations of the FAEs with various twist and fold angles of the C=C bond, as well as various dihedral angles of attached aryl units with respect to the C=C bond. The relationships between color and these parameters associated with conformational features around the C=C bond were elucidated in experimental and computational studies. Owing to the fact that they are separated by small energy barriers, the variously colored conformations in the FAE crystal change in response to various external stimuli, such as mechanical grinding, hydrostatic pressure and thermal heating.

         <dc:description>A composite of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) GeSe  2  nanosheets dispersed on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (GeSe  2  /N&#8208;rGO) is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process. The high electronic conductivity and the substantial void spaces of the wrinkled N&#8208;rGO can improve the electrical conductivity of the active material and accommodate the volume evolution of GeSe  2  nanosheets during the (de)lithiation processes, while GeSe  2  nanosheets can reduce ion diffusion length effectively. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure is beneficial to the contact of the active material and electrolyte, and the reversibility of conversion reaction has also been improved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis reveals a pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated Li  +  &#8208;storage mechanism at high rates.  In&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis discloses that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li  +  &#8208;storage. Thus, the GeSe  2  /N&#8208;rGO composite delivers excellent rate capability and good long&#8208;term stability with a high reversible capacity of 711.0 mA h g  &#8722;1  after 2000 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Reaction Profiles and Activation Volumes of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene Dimerizations Computed by the Extreme Pressure&#8208;Polarizable Continuum Model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
XP&#8208;PCM calculations on the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene show that, going from the stepwise to the concerted [4+2] cycloaddition and finally to the concerted [6+4]&#8208;ene mechanisms, as the facial overlap between the rings increases in the transition state structure, the volume of the transition state decreases, leading to a more negative activation volume and increasing reaction acceleration under pressure.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1&#8197;atm and high pressures up to the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1&#8197;atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.

The corresponding enantiomers  2  S  &#8208;  4  S  have been obtained from  1  S  containing (  S,S  )&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of  2  R  and  2  S  with (  S  )&#8208;cysteine and NaPF  6  at pH = 9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((  S  )&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF  6  (PP = (  R,R  )&#8208;Skewphos  2  R  &#8208;Cys; (  S,S  )&#8208;Skewphos  2  S  &#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for  2  R  with (  S  )&#8208;cysteine in H  2  O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of  2  R  &#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their  n  &#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549 cell lines with EC  50  values of 2.8&#8208;0.04  &#181;  M. The (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers,  4  R  (EC  50  = 0.04  &#181;  M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than  4  S  against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505C cell line.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Approach for Bio&#8208;based Arylamines via a Combined Photooxidative Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of arylamines from renewable resources under mild reaction conditions is highly desired for the sustainability of the chemical industry, where the production of hazardous waste is a prime concern. However, to date, there are very few tools in chemists&#8217; toolboxes that are able to produce arylamines in a sustainable manner. Herein, a robust one&#8208;pot approach for constructing bio&#8208;based arylamines via a combined photooxidative dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization strategy is presented. The developed methodology enables the synthesis of structurally complex amines in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good isolated yields using biomass&#8208;derived phenols, natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and naphthols under remarkably mild reaction conditions. For the photooxygenation of phenols, a novel chrysazine&#8208;based catalyst system was introduced, demonstrating its efficiency for the synthesis of natural products &#8211; hallerone and rengyolone and the pharmaceutically relevant prodrug DHED.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomorphic Fluorescent Nucleosides Facilitate a Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of RNA Depurination by Ribosome Inactivating Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins, a family of highly cytotoxic proteins  , interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within the conserved  &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop  of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Besides being biological warfare agents, certain RIPs have been promoted as potential therapeutic tools.&#160; Monitoring their deglycosylation activity and its inhibition in real time has remained, however, elusive. Herein, we describe the enzymatic preparation and utility of consensus RIP hairpin substrates in which specific G residues, neighboring the depurination site, are surgically replaced with  tz  G and  th  G, fluorescent G analogs. By strategically modifying key positions with responsive fluorescent surrogate nucleotides, RIP&#8208;mediated depurination can be monitored in real&#8208;time by steady state fluorescence spectroscopy. Subtle differences observed in preferential depurination sites provide insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; substrate recognition features.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Diverse Secondary Metal Cations on Redox&#8208;Active Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [  N  2  ,  O  2  ] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [  O  6  ] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (  M  n+  ). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  M  distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxynitrite&#8208;Promoted Persulfide Prodrugs with Protective Potential against Paracetamol Poisoning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The newly emerging persulfide prodrugs provide additional options for the profound study of persulfide, a fascinating molecule expected to intervene in biological functions and even diseases. Peroxynitrite is often the culprit in pathological processes characterized by oxidative stress, while the persulfide prodrug responsive to it is still pending. To enrich the family of redox&#8208;activated prodrugs, we designed prodrugs with a 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide trigger, which achieved the release of persulfide via 1, 6&#8208;  N  ,  S  &#8208;relay. The degradation of prodrugs and the formation of persulfides were confirmed to be peroxynitrite&#8208;responsible by the qualitative and quantitative studies based on LC&#8208;MS/MS methods and a spectrophotometry&#8208;based tag&#8208;switch strategy. Furthermore, these prodrugs showed potent peroxynitrite scavenging activity, cellular therapeutic potential against paracetamol poisoning in HepG2 and oxidative stress in H9c2, as well as desirable  in vitro  metabolic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent developments in design principles, structural tuning and integration strategies of molecular catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues, and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.

         <title>Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;Heterogeneous&#8208;Strategy Enables Multifunctional Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogenous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogenous&#8208;strategy was raised as a concept to enable the fabrication of multifunctional phase change materials (PCMs). The as&#8208;prepared PCM was endowed with enhanced thermal performance, shape flexibility, and organic pollutant removing function. This novel strategy is expected to be one of universal PCMs encapsulation method.







Abstract
Functional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are conspicuously absent in various organic or inorganic solids with diversified applications in which the attributes of these molecular materials have been highly realized. Leakage problem during the phase transition process is the main obstacle on the way of widely use of solid&#8208;liquid PCMs who has been recognized to be promisingly practical candidates for energy storage owing to the high energy storage density and small volume change in the phase transition process. Herein, a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy, in which all the starting materials involved display a homogeneous state and the encapsulation framework formed in&#8197;situ in the encapsulation process, enabled by an aerogel reaction of silica was realized under the catalysis of an organic base. Besides the comprehensive study upon energy storage performance, light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion and recyclability performance study of the obtained materials reveal the clear superiority over pristine paraffin wax (PW) thanks to the versatility and robustness of this fabrication method. More importantly, the homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous&#8208;strategy endows a unique adsorption ability with respect to organic pollutant due to the PCMs inside and therefore bearing a great potential to be used in environment protection fields.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this review, the recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction are highlighted. Various types of electro&#8208;synthesized catalysts are described. The problems and solutions of current electro&#8208;synthesized catalysts for CO2 reduction are also proposed.







Abstract
With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), the conversion and utilization of CO2 have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO2RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO2RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in CO2RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.

         <title>Highly Deep&#8208;Blue Luminescent Twisted Diphenylamino Terphenyl Emitters by Bromine&#8208;Lithium Exchange Borylation&#8208;Suzuki Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Shining in deep blue: Four highly luminescent emitters can be obtained by a bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in a one&#8208;pot fashion. Photophysical properties, such as deep&#8208;blue emission with high quantum yields in different surroundings, make this class of functional chromophores attractive for applications.







Abstract
Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylation&#8208;Suzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe Functionalization for Chemoselective Aromatic Homologation En Route to Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed methodology efficiently achieves Csp2&#8722;OMe functionalization in the presence of internal alkynes, forming chemoselectively either aromatic homologation or intramolecular monoannulation products. Furthermore, aromatic homologation products are proven as valid precursors for further diversification towards nanographene&#8208;like synthesis.







Abstract
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;OMe ortho&#8208;functionalization methodology to form chemoselectively alkyne monoannulation or aromatic homologation products is reported as a novel protocol towards the valorisation of substrates containing Csp2&#8722;OMe units. Double activation of Csp2&#8722;OMe and Csp2&#8722;F bonds is also demonstrated. Further use of aromatic homologation products towards the synthesis of nanographene&#8208;like compounds is described.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multifunctionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ketone as a synthetic intermediate of canagliflozin from a gluconolactone&#8208;derived thioester and a Grignard reagent with the aid of copper is likened to making Taiyaki, a Japanese fish&#8208;shaped waffle with sweet red bean inside. The thioester (sweet red beans) and the Grignard reagent (waffle batter) are baked on a copper waffle iron to get the desired ketone as Taiyaki. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsurugi, M. Seki, K. Mashima, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200474).

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Dinitrogen into Ammonia and Hydrazine by Using Chromium Complexes Bearing PCP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chromium complexes bearing a carbene&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;based PCP&#8208;type pincer ligand has been newly prepared, and some of them are found to work as effective catalysts to reduce dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine under atmospheric pressure. This reaction can be expressed as nitrogen molecules (raindrops) being converted into ammonia and hydrazine on the chromium complex (umbrella). More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Yoshizawa, Y. Nishibayashi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200557).

         <title>Boron&#8208;Locked Starazine &#8211; A Soluble and Fluorescent Analogue of Starphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first counterpart of starphene, namely starazine, that contains a nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinoline units locked by three tetracoordinate borons to form a quasi&#8208;planar backbone is described. This starazine possesses a non&#8208;aromatic and electron&#8208;deficient core due to the introduction of the heteroatoms replacing the corresponding carbon atoms in starphene. The transition to its lowest excited state is allowed, sharply contrasting to the starphenes, endowing fluorescent properties to this novel starlike dye molecule.







Abstract
A starlike heterocyclic molecule containing an electron&#8208;deficient nonaaza&#8208;core structure and three peripheral isoquinolines locked by three tetracoordinate borons, namely isoquinoline&#8208;nona&#8208;starazine (QNSA), is synthesized by using readily available reactants through a rather straightforward approach. This new heteroatom&#8208;rich QNSA possesses a quasi&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;backbone structure, and bears phenyl substituents on borons which protrude on both sides of the &#960;&#8208;backbones endowing it with good solubility in common organic solvents. Contrasting to its starphene analogue, QNSA shows intense fluorescence with a quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 62&#8201;% in dilute solution.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes Leading to a Stereochemical Study of the Silylated gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active cyclopropanes have been widely investigated especially from the views of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and substituting one of the methylenes with the gem&#8208; difluoromethylene unit should be promising for developing novel biologically relevant compounds and functional materials. In this paper, we disclose copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem &#8208;difluorocyclopropenes providing the corresponding chiral gem &#8208;difluorocyclopropanes. Use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me 2 PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying sodium t &#8208;butoxide in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond, and the resultant chiral difluorinated three&#8208;membered ring was unambiguously characterized. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem &#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8208;C bond leading to the transient acyclic intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylations of Aryl Boronic Acids, Halides, and Pseudo Halides with Ex Situ Generated ICF2H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expedient ex situ generation of difluoroiodomethane (DFIM) and its immediate use in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed difluoromethylation of aryl boronic acids and ester derivatives applying a two&#8208;chamber reac&#173;tor is reported. Heating a solution of bromodifluoroacetic acid with sodium iodide in sulfolane proved to be effective for generation of near stoichiometric amounts of DFIM for the ensuing catalytic coupling step. A two&#8208;step difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides employing tetrahydroxydiboron as a low&#8208;cost reducing agent, and both promoted by Pd&#8208;catalysis, proved effective for installment of this fluorine&#8208;containing C  1  &#8208;group to several pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Finally, the method proved adaptable to deuterium incorporation by simply adding D  2  O to the DFIM generating chamber.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, we describe a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties. By selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt, we have prepared a mesoionic diselenolene. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, we were able to prepare a hexa&#8208;coordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex, and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is here shown to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base, with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2, HPPh2, and the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, protonation of one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium was achieved. Resultantly, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#181;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 are finally verified and shown to be static in solution. Only the second beryllium&#8208;phosphanide structure is also prepared, with stark differences to analogous amine behaviour also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared, which is stabilized with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;Selective C&#8210;H Alkenylation and Polyenylation of Imidazoles with Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed directed decarbonylative C2&#8210;H alkenylation of imidazoles with readily available alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported. The reaction proceeds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, providing efficient access to C2&#8208;alkenylated imidazoles that are generally inaccessible by known C&#8210;H alkenylation methods. This transformation accommodates a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, including challenging conjugated polyene carboxylic acids, and diversely decorated imidazoles with high functional group compatibility. The presence of a removable pyrimidine directing group, and the use of a bidentate phosphine ligand are pivotal to the success of the catalytic reaction. In addition to imidazoles, this process is also suitable for benzimidazoles. Importantly, the scalability as well as diversification of the products highlight the potential of this protocol in practical applications. Detailed experimental and computational studies provide important insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Olefin Isomerization of Unsaturated Ketones via 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bring on the Light: An efficient photochemical metal/catalyst&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the selective one&#8208;bond olefin migration of unsaturated ketones. Diverse substrate scope, functional group tolerance and its application for dehomologation and one&#8208;carbon selective olefin migration processes in linear alkenes highlights the usefulness of this method.







Abstract
The photochemical isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones through a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism under mild conditions with high efficiency and selectivity is reported. The reaction is carried out in the absence of metal catalysts or other additives, and its stereoselectivity can be tuned by selecting appropriate solvent mixtures. The reaction&#8216;s scope and tolerance towards functional groups, including light&#8208;sensitive halogens, free acids and alcohols, were studied, providing reliable access to a wide variety of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.

     alt="Metal-Free Photochemical Olefin Isomerization of Unsaturated Ketones via 1,5-Hydrogen Atom Transfer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring on the Light&lt;/b&gt;: An efficient photochemical metal/catalyst-free system has been uncovered for the selective one-bond olefin migration of unsaturated ketones. Diverse substrate scope, functional group tolerance and its application for dehomologation and one-carbon selective olefin migration processes in linear alkenes highlights the usefulness of this method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photochemical isomerization of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;- to &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated ketones through a 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer mechanism under mild conditions with high efficiency and selectivity is reported. The reaction is carried out in the absence of metal catalysts or other additives, and its stereoselectivity can be tuned by selecting appropriate solvent mixtures. The reaction&#8216;s scope and tolerance towards functional groups, including light-sensitive halogens, free acids and alcohols, were studied, providing reliable access to a wide variety of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated ketones. This methodology details the deconjugation of a wide range of unsaturated ketones and, when combined with olefin metathesis, provides an efficient process for either dehomologation or one-carbon double-bond migration of terminal alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Terphenyl Supported Dioxophosphorane Dimer: the Light Congener of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines have been shown to mediate the release of ethene from a terphenyl supported 1,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane. This generates a dioxophosphorane dimer which is an oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. This compound was structurally characterised and its solution behaviour interrogated. Insight into the ethene release reaction is provided by the isolation of a DMAP&#8208;coordinated dioxophosphorane







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane supported by the terphenyl ligand AriPr4 (AriPr4=[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2)]) at 150&#8201;&#176;C gives [AriPr4PO2]2 via loss of ethene. [AriPr4PO2]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; it contains a 4&#8208;membered P&#8722;O&#8722;P&#8722;O ring and is the isostructural oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. The dimeric structure of [AriPr4PO2]2 was found to persist in solution through VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and DOSY, supported by DFT calculations. The addition of DMAP to the 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane facilitates the loss of ethene to give AriPr4(DMAP)PO2 after days at room temperature, with this product also characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Replacement of the DMAP with pyridine induces ethene loss from the 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane to provide gram&#8208;scale samples of [AriPr4PO2]2 in 75&#8201;% yield in 2&#8197;days at only 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Quantum Tunneling and Hydrogen Bonding Rearrangements Characterize the Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Transitions in a Phosphonium&#8208;Based Protic Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunneling driven dynamics for the PD3 group of the octyl phosphonium cation in an ionic liquid has been observed by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Deuteron line&#8208;shape analysis and relaxation time measurements provide information about the structure, mobility and rearrangements of the cations in the solid, supercooled and liquid states. Hydrogen bonds of different strengths allow the change in molecular ordering upon phase transformation to be mapped. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;I. Kolokolov, R. Ludwig et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200257). The illustrations of the tunnel are used with the kind support of NOCH GmbH &amp; Co. KG, who owns the copyright.

         <title>Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) in green organic synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need for greener compounds able to replace conventional ones with similar reactivity is crucial for the development of sustainable chemistry. Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) represent one eco&#8208;friendly alternative to acyl halides and anhydrides. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation methodologies and reported synthetic applications of iPEs and, in particular, of isopropenyl acetate (iPAc). Intriguingly, the presence of a C=C double bond adjacent to the ester functionality makes iPEs appealing in different chemoselective organic synthesis transformations. For instance, the acyl moiety is suitable for transesterification reactions in presence of different heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles (  C  &#8208;,  O  &#8208;,  N  &#8208;,  S  &#8208;,  Se  &#8208;); these reactions are irreversible thanks to the formation of acetone, obtained upon keto&#8208;enol tautomerization of the prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol (isopropenyl) leaving group. Similarly, the unsaturation contained in the isopropenyl synthon could be selectively exploited in organic synthesis for electrophilic and/or radical additions as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (  i.e.  lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification&#8208;acetalization by exploiting the co&#8208;formation of acetone during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced cycling performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S battery enabled by PVP&#8208;blended PEO&#8208;based double&#8208;layer electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>Despite the high specific capacity of Li&#8208;S battery, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and safety issue pose a great challenge to realize its commercial application. Replacing liquid electrolyte with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) &#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte is considered as a promising method to boost the safety, but the shuttle effect of LiPSs cannot be completely eliminated. In this work, a new kind of double&#8208;layer PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is designed to restrict the LiPSs. The layer next to cathode consists of PEO and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The other layer consists of PEO. PVP with abundant of amide groups are electron&#8208;rich groups that have been proved to have strong affinity to LiPSs. The strong interaction between LiPSs and carbonyl groups in amide is verified by Attenuated Total Reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests. As a result, the assembled Li&#8208;S battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1100 mAh g  &#8208;1  &#160;and capacity retention of 347 mAh g  &#8208;1  &#160;after 200 cycles at 60&#176;C&#160;and 0.05&#160;C, while the capacity retention of the battery without PVP&#8208;blended PEO electrolyte remains only 27% at the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Aminoglycoside Antibiotics Overcomes Bacterial Resistance Mediated by APH(3&#8217;) Kinases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance is causing a threat to patients infected by multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In particular, the clinical use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterials of last resort, is limited due to rising bacterial resistance. One of the major resistance mechanisms in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is phosphorylation of these amino sugars at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position by  O  &#8208;phosphotransferases [APH(3&#8217;)s].

         <title>Deposition of vertically aligned Ag/Ag2S nanoflakes on EGaIn particles for humidity sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8208;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared, which were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag  2  S core&#8208;shell composite particles. The humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag  2  S particles showed much higher sensing response as compared to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag  2  S to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Acid&#8208;Triggered Formation of Reversibly Photoswitchable Stenhouse Salts from Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In acidic conditions, the end&#8208;groups of water&#8208;soluble donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts exhibit an unexpected fast scrambling, which generates attractive reversibly photoswitchable Stenhouse salts.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are reversibly photoswitchable dyes, which are able to interconvert between a red/NIR absorbing triene&#8208;like state and a colorless cyclic state. Although optically attractive for multiple applications, their low solubility and lack of photoswitching in water impede their use in aqueous environments. We developed water&#8208;soluble DASAs based on indoline as donor and methyl, or trifluoromethyl, pyrazolone&#8208;based acceptors. In acetonitrile, photophysical analysis and photochemical studies, accounted with a three&#8208;state kinetic model, confirmed the reversible photoswitching mechanism previously proposed. In water, the colorless cyclic state is a thermodynamic sink at neutral pH values. In contrast, in acidic conditions, we observed a fast scrambling of DASAs&#8217; end&#8208;group resulting in the in&#8197;situ formation of Stenhouse salts (StS), which are in turn capable of reversible photoswitching. We believe that this unexpected result is of interest not only for the future design of DASAs with improved stability, but also for further development and applications of StS as photoswitchable probes.

         <title>Sulfonyl Nitrene and Amidyl Radical: Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation of sulfonyl azides leads to generation of reactive radicals that activate aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This study compares intrinsic reactivities of triplet sulfonyl nitrene, sulfonyl amidyl radicals and sulfonyl nitrene radical anions in the gas phase towards a series of hydrocarbons and correlates it to their structures investigated by ion spectroscopy. The most reactive triplet nitrene abstracts a hydrogen atom from ethane.







Abstract
Photocatalytic generation of nitrenes and radicals can be used to tune or even control their reactivity. Photocatalytic activation of sulfonyl azides leads to the elimination of N2 and the resulting reactive species initiate C&#8722;H activations and amide formation reactions. Here, we present reactive radicals that are generated from sulfonyl azides: sulfonyl nitrene radical anion, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radical, and test their gas phase reactivity in C&#8722;H activation reactions. The sulfonyl nitrene radical anion is the least reactive and its reactivity is governed by the proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radicals react via hydrogen atom transfer pathways. These reactivities and detailed characterization of the radicals with vibrational spectroscopy and with DFT calculations provide information necessary for taking control over the reactivity of these intermediates.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Metathesis of an Ionic Liquid on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the surface preparation: 0.5&#8197;ML [dema][TfO] and 1.0&#8197;ML [C8C1Im][PF6] were sequentially deposited on Ag(111) at 90&#8197;K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 500&#8197;K, which leads to the selective desorption of [dema][PF6] and [C8C1Im][PF6] at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, the new IL [C8C1Im][TfO] is formed by on&#8208;surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which then completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K.







Abstract
We investigated the adsorption, surface enrichment, ion exchange, and on&#8208;surface metathesis of ultrathin mixed IL films on Ag(111). We stepwise deposited 0.5&#8197;ML of the protic IL diethylmethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([dema][TfO]) and 1.0&#8197;ML of the aprotic IL 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C8C1Im][PF6]) at around 90&#8197;K. Thereafter, the resulting layered frozen film was heated to 550&#8197;K, and the thermally induced phenomena were monitored in&#8197;situ by angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Between 135 and 200&#8197;K, [TfO]&#8722; anions at the Ag(111) surface are exchanged by [PF6]&#8722; anions and enriched together with [C8C1Im]+ cations at the IL/vacuum interface. Upon further heating, [dema][PF6] and [OMIm][PF6] desorb selectively at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, a wetting layer of pure [C8C1Im][TfO] is formed by on&#8208;surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K. For comparison, ion enrichment at the vacuum/IL interface was also studied in macroscopic IL mixtures, where no influence of the solid support is expected.

         <title>Taming of the DIBAL Promoted Debenzylation of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin. Kinetics, Substituent Effects and Efficient Synthesis of Lings Tetrol**
</title>

Understanding the kinetics of a reaction is important if one wish to control it. It was realized that diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) promoted debenzylation of the secondary alcohols in 2A&#8211;F,3A&#8211;F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;hexadecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (4) was zero order in DIBAL and most likely following an intramolecular mechanism. Using this information, 2A&#8211;F,3B,C,E,F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;tetradecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (Lings tetrol), an extremely useful building block, could be formed as sole product and in good yield by conducting the reaction at low DIBAL concentration.







Abstract
The kinetics of the reaction of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was studied varying the concentration of DIBAL and substrate, and the temperature. The initial debenzylation was found to be 1st order in substrate and follow the relationship 0.0675+0.179[DIBAL]2 with respect to the concentration of DIBAL. The second and the third debenzylation which led to the 3A,6A,6D&#8208;triol (Lings triol) were both found to be 1st order in substrate concentration and zero order in DIBAL concentration. Longer reaction times with DIBAL in high concentration gave further debenzylation to comparatively complex mixtures containing the 2B,3A,6A,6D&#8208;tetrol and the 3A,6A,6C,6D&#8208;tetrol. In contrast reaction at 0.1&#8197;M DIBAL gave the symmetrical 3A,6A,3D,6D&#8208;tetrol (Lings tetrol) in 60&#8201;% yield. The effect of chlorine or methyl substitution of the phenyl groups of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was also investigated. Per 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl slowed down the reaction with DIBAL, while 4&#8208;methylbenzyl increased the reaction rate, but still gave the corresponding 6&#8197;A&#8208;monool or 6A,6D&#8208;diol products. A Hammett reaction constant of &#8722;4.9 was found for the first debenzylation showing a high degree of positive charge in the transition state. The per(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derivative was completely resistant to DIBAL, however upon addition of trimethyl aluminium this derivative also reacted to give the 6A,6D&#8208;diol product.

         <title>A Tale of Two Complexes: Electro&#8208;Assisted Oxidation of Thioanisole by an &#8220;O2 Activator/Oxidizing Species&#8221; Tandem System of Non&#8208;Heme Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of thioanisole by O2 was achieved using a tandem couple &#8220;O2 activator/oxidation system&#8221; of non&#8208;heme complexes: at an electrode, L2FeIII(OTf) is reduced to FeII, which activates O2 to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)FeII(PF6). The latter generates a reactive species capable of substrate oxygenation.







Abstract
We report two new FeIII complexes [L1FeIII(H2O)](OTf)2 and [L2FeIII(OTf)], obtained by replacing pyridines by phenolates in a known non&#8208;heme aminopyridine iron complex. While the original, starting aminopyridine [(L52)FeII(MeCN)](PF6) complex is stable in air, the potentials of the new FeIII/II couples decrease to the point that [L2FeII] spontaneously reduces O2 to superoxide. We used it as an O2 activator in an electrochemical setup, as its presence allows to generate superoxide at a much more accessible potential (&gt;500&#8197;mV gain). Our aim was to achieve substrate oxidation via the reductive activation of O2. While L2FeIII(OTf) proved to be a good O2 activator but a poor oxidation system, its association with another complex (TPEN)FeII(PF6)2 generates a complementary tandem couple for electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of substrates, working at a very accessible potential: upon reduction, L2FeIII(OTf) activates O2 to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)FeII(PF6)2 leading in fine to the oxidation of thioanisole.

         <title>Hydroxy Groups Enhance [2]Rotaxane Anion Binding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new rotaxanes were synthesized containing phenolic O&#8208;H groups on the axle component. These O&#8208;H groups hydrogen bond to the macrocycle component, rigidifying the binding pocket and resulting in significantly enhanced selectivity for chloride anions over more basic oxoanions.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two [2]rotaxanes containing an interlocked three dimensional binding cavity formed from a pyridinium bis(amide) axle component containing two phenol donors, and an isophthalamide based macrocycle. In the competitive solvent mixture 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 CDCl3&#8201;:&#8201;CD3OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi&#8208;empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylazopyrazole&#8208;containing divalent ligand was tailored to control multivalent binding to the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) by light irradiation. The ligand was designed in such a way that only the E isomer is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA. The two photoisomers show an unprecedentedly high change in binding affinity, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and different binding modes (chelating binding for the E isomer and crosslinking binding for the Z isomer).







Abstract
Multivalent receptor&#8211;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, which can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, which has recently been introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative E/Z photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the Z isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the E isomer to crosslinking binding of the Z isomer.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8208;Co9S8 Core&#8208;shell Nanoneedle Arrays via Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic and architecture dual engineering strategy is a considerable way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly&#8208;efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Herein, a carbon cloth supported Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8208;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC) is designed and developed for accelerating the sluggish kinetics of OER. Profited by valance alternative Ce doping, well&#8208;fined core&#8208;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, the resultant Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly&#8208;exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels, which collaboratively afford for the favorable OER catalytic process. The resultant Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable OER performance in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for the OER, which is 70 mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. The robust stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100 % Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrating in a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and distinguished long&#8208;term stability, demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>pH switchable water dispersed photocatalytic nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photogeneration of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) finds applications in fields as different as nanomedicine, art preservation, air and water depollution and surface decontamination. Here we present photocatalytic nanoparticles (NP) that are active only at acidic pH while they do not show relevant ROS photo&#8208;generation at neutral pH. This dual responsivity (to light and pH) is achieved by stabilizing the surface of TiO  2  NP with a specific organic shell during the synthesis and it is peculiar of the achieved core shell&#8208;structure, as demonstrated by comparison with commercial photocatalytic TiO  2  NP. For the investigation of the photocatalytic activity we developed two methods that allow real time detection of the process preventing any kind of artifact arising from post&#8208;treatments and delayed analysis. The reversibility of the pH response was also demonstrated as well as the selective photo&#8208;killing of cancer cells at acidic pH.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Surface&#8208;Tethered Polymer Brush Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new key: The incorporation of luminescence into surface&#8208;tethered polymer brushes is discussed in this review. It unlocks new characterization techniques and has been used for a wide range of applications including sensors, cellular labelling, optoelectronics and stenography. These materials can demonstrate enhanced stability compared to physisorbed polymer films or luminescent dyes, and offer improved control over both the composition of thin films and their spatial arrangement.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface&#8208;tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.

         <title>Deciphering the Spectral Tuning Mechanism in Proteorhodopsin: The Dominant Role of Electrostatics Instead of Chromophore Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are two phenotypes of proteorhodopsin exhibiting an environmental adaption to the ocean's depth. These are blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). The key to the blue/green shift between these variants originates from position 105, where BPR contains a glutamine (Q) and GPR a leucine (L). In this work it was found that Q105 is responsible for generating a positive electrostatic potential near the retinal chromophore leading to the observed blue&#8208;shift in BPR.







Abstract
Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a photoactive proton pump found in marine bacteria. There are two phenotypes of PR exhibiting an environmental adaptation to the ocean's depth which tunes their maximum absorption: blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). This blue/green color&#8208;shift is controlled by a glutamine to leucine substitution at position 105 which accounts for a 20&#8197;nm shift. Typically, spectral tuning in rhodopsins is rationalized by the external point charge model but the Q105L mutation is charge neutral. To study this tuning mechanism, we employed the hybrid QM/MM method with sampling from molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that the positive partial charge of glutamine near the C14&#8722;C15 bond of retinal shortens the effective conjugation length of the chromophore compared to the leucine residue. The derived mechanism can be applied to explain the color regulation in other retinal proteins and can serve as a guideline for rational design of spectral shifts.

         <title>Bimetallic Cage&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction with Enhanced Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;based MOF (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101) was synthesized with biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on nickel&#8208;clusters to form a 3D framework. A series of isostructural bimetallic MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 were synthesized and studied for the electrochemical HER. Among them, the bimetallic CuxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 family exhibit improved electrocatalytic HER performance in 0.5&#8197;M sulfuric acid electrolyte, owing to the synergistic effect of the Cu/Ni bimetallic centers.







Abstract
A cage&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101) with biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized via solvothermal method. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octa&#8208;nuclear nickel&#8208;clusters that are connected with each other by the 4&#8208;connected ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed&#8208;metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 (M=Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The electrocatalytic studies showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of CuxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 is much higher than that of other MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centers. The optimized Cu0.19Ni0.81&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 has an overpotential of 324&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 131&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The mechanism of HER activity over these bimetallic MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A cage-based MOF (Ni-NKU-101)&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized with biphenyl-3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;-tetracarboxylic acid. Ni-NKU-101 contains two types of cages based on nickel-clusters to form a 3D framework. A series of isostructural bimetallic M&lt;sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cage-based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni-NKU-101) with biphenyl-3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;-tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized via solvothermal method. Ni-NKU-101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octa-nuclear nickel-clusters that are connected with each other by the 4-connected ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed-metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of M&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-NKU-101 (M=Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The electrocatalytic studies showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-NKU-101 is much higher than that of other M&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-NKU-101 catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centers. The optimized Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.19&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.81&lt;/sub&gt;-NKU-101 has an overpotential of 324&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a Tafel slope of 131&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The mechanism of HER activity over these bimetallic MOF-based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new red&#8208;emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen is designed for high performance thermoresponsive materials. Molecularly dispersing the AIEgen into an elastomer&#8208;like poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) is shown to significantly improve both the contrast ratio and response time of the resulting thermoresponsive film, making it quite suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing.







Abstract
Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high&#8208;performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on a pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (&#8764;ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established by using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient anion receptor with photoswitchable functionality based on a new photoresponsive chromophore is introduced. Upon photoirradiation with UV light, (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium displays a switched&#8208;off change in binding strength towards sulfate of more than five orders of magnitude. In DMSO, the open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, thereby releasing the bound sulfate.







Abstract
In a leap toward anion separation that uses only energy input for binding and release cycles, we report herein a new class of photoswitchable anion receptors featuring a diiminoguanidinium functionality that displays a change of more than five orders of magnitude in switched&#8208;off binding strength towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion, upon photoirradiation with UV light. The (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium cation, synthesized as the triflate salt, binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in [D6]DMSO owing to its bidentate guanidinium hydrogen bonding, which can chelate the O&#8722;S&#8722;O edge of sulfate. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is essentially shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, as shown by anion&#8208;binding titrations, theoretical calculations, and X&#8208;ray structural analysis. This approach will allow the development of advanced anion&#8208;separation cycles that use only energy input and generate no chemical waste, and thus address challenging chemical separation problems in a more sustainable way.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of electrochemical capacitors because of their light weight, high strength and high processability. The preparation method and structure design of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials are very important to the performance of capacitors.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability and appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of the electrode material, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely shown to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of their light weight, high strength, and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials, including planar 2D materials, random 3D, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state of the art of carbon&#8208;based ECs is discussed from the viewpoint of the structure of the electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept presents integrated perspectives on the further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.

         <title>Transition Metal Doping Induces Ti3+ to Promote the Performance of SrTiO3@TiO2 Visible Light Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Prepare C1 Product.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu&#8208;doped SrTiO3@TiO2 (strontium titanate&#8208;rich titanate) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. The photoresponse range of SrTiO3@TiO2 material is broadened to the visible region. The Ti3+ induced by the charge compensation effect greatly promotes the photoelectron&#8208;hole separation, which in turn promotes the ability of the catalyst to reduce CO2 to produce C1 products in water.







Abstract
Transition metal Fe, Co, Ni and Cu doped strontium titanate&#8208;rich SrTiO3@TiO2 (STO@T) materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared doped materials exhibit better photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 ability under visible light conditions. Among them, Fe&#8208;doped and undoped SrTiO3@TiO2 under visible light conditions CO2 reduction products only CO, while M&#8208;STO@T (M=Co, Ni, Cu) samples converted CO2 to CH4. The average methane yield of Ni&#8208;doped STO@T samples are as high as 73.85&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti3+ plays an important role in the production of methane by CO2 visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO2 reduction mechanism were explained.

The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; plays an important role in the production of methane by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction mechanism were explained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A single bioinspired hexameric nickel catechol&#8208;alloxazine catalyst combines metal and radical mechanisms for alkene hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanisms combining organic radicals and metallic intermediates hold strong potential in homogeneous catalysis. Such activation modes require careful optimization of two interconnected processes: one for the generation of radicals and one for their productive integration towards the final product. We report that a bioinspired polymetallic nickel complex can combine ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered reactivities to perform fast hydrosilylation of alkenes under mild conditions through an unusual dual radical&#8208; and metalbased mechanism. This earth&#8208;abundant polymetallic complex incorporating a catechol&#8208;alloxazine motif as redox&#8208;active ligand operates at low catalyst loading (0.25 mol%) and generates silyl radicals and a nickel&#8208;hydride intermediate through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step. Evidence of an isomerization sequence enabling terminal hydrosilylation of internal alkenes points towards the involvement of the nickel&#8208;hydride species in chain walking. This single catalyst promotes a hybrid pathway by combining synergistically ligand and metal participation in both inner&#8208; and outer&#8208; sphere processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reliable Functionalization of 5,6&#8208;Fused Bicyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles Pyrazolopyrimidines and Imidazopyridazines via Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DFT&#8208;calculations allow prediction of the reactivity of uncommon  N  &#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridazines and considerably facilitate their functionalization. The derivatization of these  N  &#8208;heterocycles was realized using Grignard reagents for nucleophilic additions to 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidines and TMP  2  Zn&#183;2MgCl  2  &#183;2LiCl allowed regioselective zincations. In the case of 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridazine, bases such as TMP  2  Zn&#183;MgCl  2  &#183;2LiCl, in the presence or absence of BF  3  &#183;OEt  2  , led to regioselective metalations at positions 3 or 8. Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta&#8208;substitution). X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete  cyclo  &#8208;  i  Pr  2  N&#8722;BC  10  H  6  reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)  2  with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with&#160;IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)  2  and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford  spiro  &#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We discuss in this CONCEPT mini&#8208;review the fundamental and polymerization chemistry of inverse vulcanization for the preparation of statistical and segmented sulfur copolymers, which have been actively developed and advanced in various applications over the past decade. We explicitly delve into a discussion of step&#8208;growth polymerization constructs to describe the inverse vulcanization process and discuss prepolymer approaches for the synthesis of segmented sulfur polyurethanes. We further discuss the advantages of inverse vulcanization in conjunction with dynamic covalent polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization modifications to prepare segmented block copolymers with enhanced thermomechanical and flame retardant properties of these materials.</dc:description>
