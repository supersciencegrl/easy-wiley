         <title>Metal Free Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles with Vinylarenes and Pyridine Enabled by Photocatalytic Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules.

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable organic radical cations with multiple redox states spanning over notably wide redox range (1.8&#8197;V) were derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The availability of stable multiple redox states was utilized in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. The system works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process with a minimum capacity loss and regenerated upon exposure to air.







Abstract
An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8&#8197;V redox range. These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies. Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture. The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30&#8197;days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss. Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.

         <title>In situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8208;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow Monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazonium trifluoroacetates for biphenyls are an underrated aryl radical source for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. This concept does not require any additional catalysts to perform an efficient and selective reaction. The photoarylation is supported by the application of Flow Chemistry using microreactors and modern LED technology. An integrated benchtop NMR spectrometer enables real&#8208;time analysis of the substituted products.







Abstract
A novel class of diazonium salts is introduced for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling to produce (substituted) biphenyls. As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl&#8208;radical by irradiation with UV&#8208;A light (365&#8197;nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8722;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline 19F&#8208;NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine&#8208;substituents act as a probe. Here, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.

         <title>Influence of Polymer Side Chain Size and Backbone Length on the Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Polymer Bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) can assemble into supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes in water when conjugated to hydrophilic polymers. Here we investigate the effect of side and main chain lengths of the attached polymers on the resulting morphologies. Both longer main and side chains induce a morphological transition from cylindrical to spherical micelles, but the latter can even prevent any form of aggregation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush-like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pH probes applicable in staining lysosomes in live human cells have been synthesized and characterized. These aminobenzocoumarins display large Stokes shifts, emission in the visible region, and up to 300&#8208;fold emission intensity increase upon activation in acidic conditions.







Abstract
Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise Cu54 nanoclusters with eight free valence electrons have been prepared, characterized, and structurally determined. The clusters show high performance in the field of photothermal conversion. For the first time, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are proved to be effective in photothermal application, which may stimulate the research on using copper nanoclusters in material sciences.







Abstract
Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X=S or none, tBuSH=2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;ex=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8211;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20:1), up to 96% ee, and yields up to 52%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in the Continuous Flow Synthesis of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;Membered Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleic acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Encapsulated Materials for Biological Cascade Chemistry and Synergistic Tumor Starvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether Naphthotube Host&#8208;guest Complexes and [2]Rotaxanes with Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host&#8208;guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 102 to 106 M&#8208;1, which were confirmed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectra and ITC experiments. The host&#8208;guest interactions are driven by enthalpy change as the entropic factors are unfavorable. Positive correlations between &#916;H and &#916;S have been observed in the host&#8208;guest complexes. Furthermore, the para&#8208;substitution of the guests can significantly affect the binding affinities through a combination of field/inductive and resonance effects by following a linear free energy relationship. Based on the host&#8208;guest complexes composed of ether naphthotube and organic cations, two interlocked [2]rotaxanes were prepared by cationization reaction and Huisgen cycloaddition between the cations and the stopper components. The ether naphthotube&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes are useful for creating sophisticated interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization</dc:description>

         <title>On the Use of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine&#160;N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA purity for controlled ring opening polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein&#8217;s Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#160;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8208;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective transition enhancement in a g&#8208;engineered diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diradical with engineered g&#8208;asymmetry was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#729; radical platform. Various spectroscopic techniques and computational studies revealed that the electronic structures of the two spin systems remained minimally affected within the diradical system. Fluid&#8208;solution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments revealed a weak exchange coupling with |J| ~ 0.014 cm&#8208;1, subsequently rationalized by CAS&#8208;SCF calculations. Frozen solution continuous&#8208;wave (CW) EPR experiments showed a complicated and power&#8208;dependent spectrum that eluded analysis using the point&#8208;dipole model. Pulse EPR manipulations with varying microwave powers, or under varying magnetic fields, demonstrated that different resonances could be selectively enhanced or suppressed, based on their different tipping angles. In particular, Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra revealed absorptions of MW power&#8208;dependent intensities, while Field&#8208;Swept Spin Nutation (FSSN) experiments revealed two distinct Rabi frequencies. This study introduces a methodology to synthesize and characterize g&#8208;asymmetric two&#8208;spin systems, of interest in the implementation of spin&#8208;based CNOT gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Emergent Properties in Chemistry &#8208; Relating Molecular Properties to Bulk Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain physico&#8208;chemical properties like density or color emerge only when a sufficient number of atoms or molecules are combined in a suitable way. By discussing various case studies, such as the liquidity of water, we here investigate the fundamental types of emergence in chemistry. Studying how properties emerge enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of these properties.







Abstract
Certain properties of an object only emerge when a sufficient number of those objects are present in a definite arrangement. For example, one or two water molecules cannot said to be in a liquid state, but a drop of water can be. This concept of emergence has been studied extensively, but only occasionally discussed explicitly in the context of chemistry. In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.

     alt="Emergent Properties in Chemistry - Relating Molecular Properties to Bulk Behavior"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain physico-chemical properties like density or color emerge only when a sufficient number of atoms or molecules are combined in a suitable way. By discussing various case studies, such as the liquidity of water, we here investigate the fundamental types of emergence in chemistry. Studying how properties emerge enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of these properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain properties of an object only emerge when a sufficient number of those objects are present in a definite arrangement. For example, one or two water molecules cannot said to be in a liquid state, but a drop of water can be. This concept of &lt;i&gt;emergence&lt;/i&gt; has been studied extensively, but only occasionally discussed explicitly in the context of chemistry. In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) sialosides containing NeuAc and NeuGc by using double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acyl sialyl donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc&#8208;containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl sialyl donors. The 7&#8208;O,9&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl protection of an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;5&#8208;N,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;protected sialyl donor markedly increased the a&#8208;selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N&#8208;acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N&#8208;acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N&#8208;glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N&#8208;acetyl carbamate due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxygen in the N&#8208;acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N&#8208;glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C&#8208;6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent a&#8208;selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3&#8208;diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc-containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl-protected N-acetyl sialyl donors. The 7-O,9-O-carbonyl protection of an N-acyl-5-N,4-O-carbonyl-protected sialyl donor markedly increased the a-selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C-8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N-acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N-acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N-glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N-acetyl carbamate due to the electron-withdrawing oxygen in the N-acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N-glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C-6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent a-selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3-diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C-8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Driven Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic trifluoromethylation is efficiently initiated through a photochemical reaction utilizing an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, proceeding smoothly without the use of photocatalysts, transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or additional oxidants. This method has been optimized through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its versatility and efficacy across various substrates, including quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. Notably, this approach enables the practical synthesis of trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations that incorporate radical trapping and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of the an EDA complex and elucidated the reaction pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of EDA photoactivation in trifluoromethylation, significantly expanding the application scope of EDA complexes in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl Dimers as New Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimers of anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl units and its mesityl derivative were synthesized by Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the corresponding chloro derivatives as new biaryls. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed that two polycyclic aromatic units with nonplanar deformations took a twisted conformation about the single bond as a chiral axis. Enantiomers of the nonsubstituted compound were resolved by chiral HPLC, and the enantiopure samples showed intense Cotton effects at 321 nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and emission bands at 449 nm in the circularly polarized lumines&#173;cence (CPL) spectra with dissymmetry factor of |glum| 3.6 &#215; 10&#8211;3. The absolute stereochemistry of this biaryl was determined by the theoretical calculation of CD spectrum by the time&#8208;dependent DFT method. The barrier to enantiomerization was determined to be 108 kJ mol&#8211;1 at 298 K. The dynamic process proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving the helical inversion of each aromatic unit and the rotation about the biaryl axis as analyzed by the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A family of hexacopper phenylsilsesquioxane/acetate complexes: synthesis, solvent&#8208;controlled cage structures, and catalytic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Convenient self&#8208;assembly synthesis of copper(II) complexes via double (phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate) ligation allows to isolate a family of impressive sandwich&#8208;like cage compounds. An intriguing feature of these complexes is the difference in the structure of a pair of silsesquioxane ligands despite identical (Cu6) nuclearity and number (four) of acetate fragments. Formation of particular combination of silsesquioxane ligands (cyclic/cyclic vs condensed/condensed vs cyclic/condensed) was found to be dependent on the synthesis/crystallization media. A combination of Si4&#8208;cyclic and Si6&#8208;condensed silsesquioxane ligands is a brand new feature of cage metallasilsesquioxanes. A representative Cu6&#8208;complex (4) (with cyclic silsesquioxanes) exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. Maximum yield of the products of cyclohexane oxidation attained 30%. The compound 4 was also tested as catalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone by m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid: maximum yields of 88% and 100% of &#949;&#8208;caprolactone were achieved upon conventional heating at 50 &#176;C for 4 h and MW irradiation at 70 or 80 &#176;C during 30 min, respectively. It was also possible to obtain the lactone (up to 16% yield) directly from the cyclohexane via a tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction using the same oxidant.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Ultrafine PtIr Clusters supported on Co3O4 Nanoflowers for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green hydrogen production through electrochemical overall water splitting has suffered from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, inferior conversion efficiency, and high cost. Herein, ultrafine PtIr clusters are synthesized via an electrodeposition method and decorated on the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires (PtIr&#8208;Co3O4). The encouraging performances in electrochemical OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are achieved over the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst, with the overpotentials as low as 410 and 237 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, outperforming the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Due to the ultralow loading of PtIr clusters, the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst exhibits 1270 A gIr&#8208;1 for OER at the overpotential of 400 mV. Our detailed analyses also show that the strong interactions between the ultrafine PtIr clusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers enable the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst to afford 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for the overall water splitting at the potential of 1.57 V, accompanied by high durability for 100 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom Promoted Polyhexagonal Saddle&#8208;Shaped Molecular Structure and Its Supramolecular Coassembly with C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with curved architecture can exhibit unique opto&#8208;electronic properties due to the concave&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;surface. However, synthesizing negatively curved saddle&#8208;shaped aromatic systems has been challenging due to the internal structural strain. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of two polyhexagonal molecular systems, 1 and 2, with saddle shape geometry by judiciously varying the aromatic moiety, avoiding the harsh synthetic methods as that of heptagonal aromatic saddle systems. The unique geometry preferences of B, N, and S furnish suitable curvature to the molecules, featuring saddle shape. The saddle geometry also enables them to interact with fullerene C60, and the supramolecular interactions of fullerene C60with 1 and 2 modify their optoelectronic properties. Crystal structure analysis reveals that 1, with a small &#960;&#8208;surface, forms a double columnar array of fullerenes in the solid state. In contrast, 2 with a large &#960;&#8208;surface produces a supramolecular capsule entrapping discrete fullerene dimer. The intermolecular interactions between B, N, S, and the aryl&#8208;&#960; surface of the host and C60 guest are the stabilizing factors for creating these supramolecular structures. Comprehensive computational, optical, electrochemical, and Raman spectroscopic studies establish the charge transfer interactions between B&#8208;N doped heterocycle host and fullerene C60 guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization and In Vitro Behavior of PEO Coated Mg Modified with Antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>

Mg gained significant attention as a candidate for implant materials. However, its use is limited due to corrosion process and pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The use of Mg&#8208;based biomaterials with a number of their advantageous properties are overshadowed by uncontrollable metal corrosion. Moreover, the use of implants goes alongside with the threat of pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity. To achieve a suitable level of anticorrosion protection phosphate and fluoride&#8208;phosphate electrolytes are used in the PEO process. Investigation of the surface thickness and morphology done by means of cross&#8208;section analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assay show precedence of the fluoride containing PEO coating and make it the material of choice for further modification with Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes. The presence of the complexes on the PEO surface is confirmed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) are used to estimate the complexes&#8217; chemical state and depth of penetration in the coating surface. Based on the results of antibacterial assay, the modified coatings are found to be active against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Improved Interface Construction on Anode and Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ultralow&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Containing Dual&#8208;Additives</title>

Electrode/electrolyte interface built by the dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB enables significant improvement on the cycling stability of hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell.







Abstract
Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3&#8197;M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17&#8201;% (baseline) to 79&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB) and 83&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB and 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three classes of Carbon Dots with different composition and charged surfaces were prepared and completely characterised with regards to their morphology and physicochemical properties. We demonstrate the requirement of a positively&#8208;charged surface to exert antibiofilm formation by C. albicans paired with anti&#8208;adhesion and internalization properties, and with a mortality reduction of infected larvae in in&#8197;vivo tests.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.

         <title>Controlling the Activation at NiII&#8722;CO22&#8722; Moieties through Lewis Acid Interactions in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nickel&#8208;carbonite complexes the degree of CO2 activation depends on the nature of the alkali metal counterion, the strength of its interaction with the carbonite unit &#8211; and thus its spacial separation &#8211; as well as on further polar entities in the second coordination sphere. This is also reflected in the reactivity towards electrophiles which lead to C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Nickel complexes with a two&#8208;electron reduced CO2 ligand (CO22&#8722;, &#8220;carbonite&#8221;) are investigated with regard to the influence alkali metal (AM) ions have as Lewis acids on the activation of the CO2 entity. For this purpose complexes with NiII(CO2)AM (AM=Li, Na, K) moieties were accessed via deprotonation of nickel&#8208;formate compounds with (AM)N(iPr)2. It was found that not only the nature of the AM ions in vicinity to CO2 affect the activation, but also the number and the ligation of a given AM. To this end the effects of added (AM)N(R)2, THF, open and closed polyethers as well as cryptands were systematically studied. In 14 cases the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and correlations with the situation in solution were made. The more the AM ions get detached from the carbonite ligand, the lower is the degree of aggregation. At the same time the extent of CO2 activation is decreased as indicated by the structural and spectroscopic analysis and reactivity studies. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the coordinating AM Lewis acidic fragment withdraws only a small amount of charge from the carbonite moiety, but it also affects the internal charge equilibration between the LtBuNi and carbonite moieties.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Characterization of a pH&#8208;Sensitive Quadracyclic Uridine (qU) Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the synthesis and detailed photophysical characterization of qU &#8211; a novel fluorescent base analogue of uridine. qU exhibits interesting properties such as excitation in the visible region with high brightness, dual emission, pH sensitivity, and an ESPT reaction. This work has extended the toolbox of internal RNA labels for future applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) have become useful tools for applications in biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, live&#8208;cell imaging, and RNA therapeutics. Herein, two synthetic routes towards a novel FBA of uracil named qU (quadracyclic uracil/uridine) are described. The qU nucleobase bears a tetracyclic fused ring system and is designed to allow for specific Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing with adenine. We find that qU absorbs light in the visible region of the spectrum and emits brightly with a quantum yield of 27&#8201;% and a dual&#8208;band character in a wide pH range. With evidence, among other things, from fluorescence lifetime measurements we suggest that this dual emission feature results from an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Furthermore, we find that both absorption and emission of qU are highly sensitive to pH. The high brightness in combination with excitation in the visible and pH responsiveness makes qU an interesting native&#8208;like nucleic acid label in spectroscopy and microscopy applications in, for example, the field of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics.

         <title>Detecting Protein&#8208;Ligand Interactions with Nitroxide Based Paramagnetic Cosolutes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy&#8208;to&#8208;use NMR method for studying protein&#8208;ligand interactions is presented, relying on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements induced by soluble nitroxide molecules. The NMR method can be useful for detecting changes of the electrostatic potential of proteins triggered by ligand binding and for detecting the location of ligand binding sites.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy techniques can provide important information about protein&#8208;ligand interactions. Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective molecular recognition properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors toward the cis isomer of acetylated lysine (cis&#8208;Kac) are investigated. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex is favoured for the aryl&#8208;extended receptor compared to the superaryl&#8208;extended featuring a deeper cavity for which the energetically not favourable desolvation of the aminoacidic group hampers the guest inclusion in the hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between receptor&#8197;1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H&#8197;NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor&#8197;1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.

         <title>Selectively Transport and Removal of Fluoride Ion by Pillar[5]Arene Polymer&#8208;Filled Nanochannel Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride contamination of groundwater has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Currently, excessive absorption of fluoride can be toxic to humans and crops. To address the challenge, we explored the excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer framework. By constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, the pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane achieves a fluoride removal.







Abstract
Excess fluoride ions in groundwater accumulate through the roots of crops, affecting photosynthesis and inhibiting their growth. Long&#8208;term bioaccumulation also threatens human health because it is poorly degradable and toxic. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is developing a unique material that can efficiently remove fluoride ions from the environment. The excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membranes were explored to address this challenge. Constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, consisting of microscale etched nanochannels and nanoscale pillar[5]arene cross&#8208;linked polymer voids. A fluoride removal rate of 0.0088&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 was achieved. Notably, this rate surpassed the rates observed with other control ions by a factor of 6 to 8.8. Our research provides a new direction for developing water fluoride ion removal materials.

         <title>Energy Transfer on Cytoskeleton of Red Blood Cell Ghosts and their Efficiency Control by KCl Concentration&#8208;induced Cell Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a cytoskeleton network located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer. Their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as platforms for bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer using red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs) as scaffolds, relying on their asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.

         <title>Flowmicro In&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions Mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash monitoring: Direct observation of anionic polymerizing methacrylates was achieved by utilizing flow microreactors, which can transfer the unstable intermediates to spectroscopic instrument before they decompose. The in&#8208;line analysis of poly(methacrylate) anions revealed their structure, stability, and livingness, enabling the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates.







Abstract
The direct observation of reactive intermediates is an important issue for organic synthesis. However, intermediates with an extreme instability are hard to be monitored by common spectroscopic methods such as FTIR. We have developed synthetic method utilizing flow microreactors, which enables a generation and reactions of unstable intermediates. Herein we report that, based on our flowmicro techniques, we developed an in&#8208;line analysis method for reactive intermediates in increments of milliseconds. We demonstrated the direct observation of the living and dead species of the anionic polymerization of alkyl methacrylates. The direct information of the living species enabled the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates, which is the important but difficult reaction in the conventional method.

Domino Iron and Palladium Catalysis: An elegant synthetic approach to 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazoles via activation of six C&#8722;H bonds is described. The strategy consists of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative homocoupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls followed by a twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
The iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls and subsequent twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization provide a convergent synthetic route to 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazoles. Screening a range of different palladium(II) salts led to palladium(II) acetate, pivalate, and hexafluoroacetylacetonate as the most efficient catalysts. Remarkably, the twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization can also be performed under argon. The mechanism for the oxidative cyclization under an inert gas presumably involves regeneration of the catalytically active palladium(II) species by oxidative addition of pivalic acid.

Electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (ECH) receive growing attention due to their sustainable potential. Our innovative one&#8208;step protocol creates carbon&#8208;supported silver electrodes, finely tunable for morphology and catalytic activity. Achieving 93&#8201;% current efficiency in ECH for the vitamin synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, even at higher current densities and reduced metal loadings, we successfully converted a library of 17&#8197;diverse substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by U.&#8208;P. Apfel, D. Siegmund and co&#8208;workers (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303808).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one&#8208;step binder&#8208; and additive&#8208;free production of silver&#8208; and copper&#8208;electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for the tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93&#8201;% for the ECH of the Vitamin&#8197;A&#8208; and E&#8208;synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single&#8208;pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17&#8197;different C&#8722;C&#8722;, C&#8722;O&#8722; and N&#8722;O&#8722;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium&#8208;based thermocatalytic state of the art.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one-step binder- and additive-free production of silver- and copper-electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for the tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93&#8201;% for the ECH of the Vitamin&#8197;A- and E-synthon 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#8197;kg&lt;sub&gt;MBE&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single-pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#8197;kg&lt;sub&gt;MBE&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17&#8197;different C&#8722;C&#8722;, C&#8722;O&#8722; and N&#8722;O&#8722;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium-based thermocatalytic state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switchable Redox and Thermo&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Based on Cyclodextrin&#8208;Polyoxometalate Tandem</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaotropic behavior of polyoxometalates is exploited as an operating principle to promote a reversible and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polymer where supramolecular networking results from the host&#8208;guest interactions between cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. This study reveals that the chaotropic effect corresponds to an effective force able to induce responsiveness into supramolecular materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Epoxidation of Cyclooctene on Surface Modified Ni Foam Using Water as Oxygen Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic strategy for highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene to the corresponding epoxide is demonstrated using Ni foam as electrocatalyst using water as the oxygen source. By controlling the hydrophobicity of the Ni foam surface the conversion of cyclooctene was substantially increased.







Abstract
Electrochemical epoxidation of olefins using water as an oxygen atom source is emerging as an alternative approach for an atom economic and sustainable method towards a highly selective synthesis of epoxides. We report an electrochemical procedure for epoxidation of cyclooctene using water as the sole oxygen atom source over a sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) modified nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 catalyst directly grown on Ni foam. The SDS modification facilitates the mass transfer of cyclooctene towards the anode, thus achieving a 2.5&#8208;fold higher conversion with more than 90&#8201;% selectivity towards the corresponding epoxide compared with pure Ni(OH)2 catalyst.

         <title>Achieving Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitable Blue TADF&#8208;Type Afterglow via Delicate Control of Excited States in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>

In contrast to blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials that require UVB excitation, this study reports visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems.







Abstract
Blue afterglow constitutes of one of the primary afterglow colors and can convert into other afterglow colors through energy transfer. The reported studies show the fabrication of blue afterglow emitters, but most of them are formed by room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence mechanism and require UVB lights as excitation source (these high&#8208;energy lights may damage organic systems). Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence type (TADF&#8208;type) afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. Tiny change of the substituents in BF2bdk system has been found to pose significant influence on excited state energy levels and consequently narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy of the system. As a result, both forward and reverse intersystem crossing have been accelerated, leading to the emergence of BF2bdk's TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in rigid crystalline matrices. The resultant TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials exhibit emission lifetimes of several hundred milliseconds, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.7&#8201;% and display temperature responsive property.

         <title>An Efficient C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aryl radical from sulfonium salts have been generated through copper&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes, which enable the successful biaryl transformation through the addition to the aryl(trialkyl)silanes for the first time. Given the fast development in the copper catalysis, this method is expected to present new opportunities for exploring aryl(trialkyl)silanes in biaryl synthesis.







Abstract
The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8722;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Symmetrically Substituted Poly(3,4&#8208;Dimethylthiophene) as Cathode for Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addressing the stability challenges in aluminum ion batteries, this research employs poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT) as a cathode material. Innovatively modifying the thiophene ring with methyl groups, PDMT adjusts local charge density and electron delocalization, boosting electrochemical reactivity and cycling stability. Exhibiting an exceptional discharge capacity of 110 mAh g&#8208;1 and maintaining 92.7% capacity after 1000 cycles, PDMT outperforms traditional polythiophene cathodes.







Abstract
The aggravation of energy problems and the scarcity of lithium resources have forced us to look for new energy storage systems. Aluminum ion batteries, as a promising energy storage system, have the advantages of environmental friendliness and abundant aluminum resources, and have the potential for application in large&#8208;scale energy storage and personal portable electronic devices. To solve the stability problem of aluminum ion batteries during cycling for large&#8208;scale energy storage needs, we report a polythiophene&#8208;based conductive polymer, poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT), as a high performance cathode material for aluminum ion batteries. By introducing two methyl groups on the thiophene ring, we successfully adjust the local charge density of the heterocyclic thiophene, thus changing the electron delocalization characteristics, and improving the electrochemical reaction activity of the polythiophene (PTH) material as a redox electrode material. This also maintains the symmetry and regularity of the polymer structure, giving the material better cycling stability. The discharge specific capacity reaches 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, far exceeding conventional PTH cathodes (~70&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and the capacity retention rate is 92.7&#8201;% after 1000 cycles. It also shows excellent rate performance due to the flexible structure of the conductive polymer.

         <title>Transport Properties with Multiple Functions of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR Single Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>

The transport properties of a series of double&#8208;layered Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices have been designed. It gives deep insight into the experimental discoveries, and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing the transport properties of the Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices.







Abstract
Encouraged by the successful fabrication of C60&#8208;GNR (GNR=graphene nanoribbon) single&#8208;molecule transistors in experiments, four Fe&#8208;containing derived double&#8208;layered devices of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR are designed by employing different electrode linkages and their transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods. Regardless of electrode connection, all these devices give rise to a smaller negative differential resistance (NDR) peak at V=0.2 and a higher peak at 1.2&#8197;V, suggesting their stable maneuverability as molecular devices and good candidates for developing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) current switches. The macroscopic NDR performance depends on the delocalization character and the crossing mechanism of the frontier orbitals. The peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios (Rmax) range from 454 to 2737, determined by the electrode linkage. Such a large Rmax&#8208;value is necessary for developing dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM) cells. Encapsulating the Fe atom inside C60 not only improves the conductivity but also introduces the spin&#8208;polarized transport property. The spin&#8208;filtering efficiency (SFE) of almost all devices oscillates up and down in response to the bias voltage, indicating the possibility of designing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) spin switches and up&#8208;down spin switches. All these fascinating properties provide an important clue for designing similar molecular devices with multiple functions by trapping magnetic transition metal atoms inside fullerenes.

         <title>Sterically Congested Protecting Group for a Boronyl Group in Iterative Aminations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide and aryl boronic acid produces aryl&#8208;oxazaborolidinone (Ar&#8208;OxB). In Ar&#8208;OxB, the &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide&#8208;moiety was found to be a good protecting group for the boronyl group. This Ar&#8208;OxB is effective for Iterative aminations including Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam couplings.







Abstract
In this study, we found that the sterically bulky &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety is a suitable framework for protecting the boronyl group of boron reagents during aminations. Condensation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide with ArB(OH)2 produced aryloxazaborolidinone (ArOxB). The reactivity of the C&#8208;B bond in ArOxB is easily controlled by the steric and weak electronic effects of the backbone. H2N&#8208;(or Br&#8722;)ArOxB underwent Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam (C&#8208;E&#8208;L) or Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig (B&#8208;H) amination with retaining the C&#8722;B bond. On the other hand, direct C&#8208;E&#8208;L amination of ArOxB was also possible in an oxidative atmosphere, in which the C&#8722;B bond was activated by CuII species. Our methodology is effective for the precise synthesis of two or more arylamino group substituted arenes.

We report on the design, synthesis, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of physisorbed monolayers of overcrowded alkene photoswitches physisorbed at the solid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
Immobilization of stimulus&#8208;responsive systems on solid surfaces is beneficial for controlled signal transmission and adaptive behavior while allowing the characterization of the functional interface with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. Positioning of the stimuli&#8208;responsive units with nanometer&#8208;scale precision across the adaptive surface remains one of the bottlenecks in the extraction of cooperative function. Nanoscale organization, cooperativity, and amplification remain key challenges in bridging the molecular and the macroscopic worlds. Here we report on the design, synthesis, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of overcrowded alkene photoswitches merged in self&#8208;assembled networks physisorbed at the solid&#8208;liquid interface. A detailed anchoring strategy that ensures appropriate orientation of the switches with respect to the solid surface through the use of bis&#8208;urea groups is presented. We implement a co&#8208;assembly strategy that enables the merging of the photoswitches within physisorbed monolayers of structurally similar &#8216;spacer&#8217; molecules. The self&#8208;assembly of the individual components and the co&#8208;assemblies was examined in detail using (sub)molecular resolution STM which confirms the robust immobilization and controlled orientation of the photoswitches within the spacer monolayers. The experimental STM data is supported by detailed molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. Different designs of the switches and the spacers were investigated which allowed us to formulate guidelines that enable the precise organization of the photoswitches in crystalline physisorbed self&#8208;assembled molecular networks.

         <title>Towards Amplified Probing of Weak Intermolecular Interactions on the External Surfaces of Molecular Capsules</title>

Highly sensitive equilibria between homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsular complexes reveal unexpected variations in the aryl&#8208;aryl interactions of eight benzoyl fragments grouped in four tight pairs on the outer surfaces of the capsules.







Abstract
We report a sensitive method for comparing weak interactions between aryl rings located on the external surfaces of equilibrating homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsules. Two identical self&#8208;complementary resorcin[4]arene tetrabenzoate molecules and one tetramethylammonium cation form in CDCl3 hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimeric capsules whose exteriors are decorated with four tight pairs of weakly interacting aryl rings. The pair wise mixing of six different homodimers establishes their equilibria with the corresponding heterodimeric species in which two types of aryl rings exert on each other some gentle forces. This equilibrium is significantly shifted either towards homo&#8208; or heterodimers depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the weakly interacting aryl rings. The thermodynamic favorability or disadvantage of the heterodimerization is determined by stronger or weaker aryl&#8208;aryl attractions in the hetero&#8208; or homodimeric capsules, respectively. The four&#8208;fold amplification of weak aryl&#8208;aryl interactions on the external surfaces of the equilibrating capsules is responsible for high sensitiveness of our approach.

Two identical self-complementary resorcin[4]arene tetrabenzoate molecules and one tetramethylammonium cation form in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogen-bonded homodimeric capsules whose exteriors are decorated with four tight pairs of weakly interacting aryl rings. The pair wise mixing of six different homodimers establishes their equilibria with the corresponding heterodimeric species in which two types of aryl rings exert on each other some gentle forces. This equilibrium is significantly shifted either towards homo- or heterodimers depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the weakly interacting aryl rings. The thermodynamic favorability or disadvantage of the heterodimerization is determined by stronger or weaker aryl-aryl attractions in the hetero- or homodimeric capsules, respectively. The four-fold amplification of weak aryl-aryl interactions on the external surfaces of the equilibrating capsules is responsible for high sensitiveness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fully enantioselective catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin employs polyene cyclization chemistry with a novel, regioselective terminator. The ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;transport studies demonstrate independence of iron uptake and morphogenic activity, suggesting the Fe(III)&#8208;complex of thallusin being of importance primarily for compound resorption.







Abstract
A fully enantioselective, catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin using polyene cyclization chemistry is reported. The synthesis features dedicated precursor design, introduction of a TMS&#8208;substituted arene as a regioselective terminator, very high enantiomer excess (ee) on gram scale, and productive scaffold functionalization. Furthermore, an ee determination methodology of thallusin samples was developed, and the ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;uptake studies demonstrated that the cellular uptake of iron facilitated by thallusin derivatives was independent of their morphogenic activity, suggesting their active import via siderophore transporters as a shuttle system.

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel=Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New family of direct band gap semiconductors. The new compound Na3In2P3 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.27&#8197;eV and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional polyanionic framework of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. Additionally, the related phosphidotrielates Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2 and Na3InP2, which are all built up by triel phosphorus tetrahedra as well, have been proven to be semiconductors as well, with direct band gaps ranging from of 1.37&#8197;eV to 2.45&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45&#8197;eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#8197;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99&#8197;eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#8197;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#8197;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E=In and vertices as well as edges for E=Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.

         <title>The Origin of Dual&#8208;Emission in PLICT Compounds &#8211; an Empirical Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>

Dual&#8208;emitting PLICT compounds based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures and exploration of their fluorescence behavior are presented. Combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations, and a unique fluorophore cataloging map allows for the easy determination of the origin of fluorescence bands.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.

         <title>Synthesis and Identification of decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins in Toxic Microalgae and their Reactions with the Oxygenase, SxtT, Reveal Saxitoxin Biosynthesis</title>

decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins (doSTXs), dd&#8208;doSTX (2), 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (4) and doSTX (5) were synthesized, and 2, 3, and 5 were identified in the toxin&#8208;producing marine dinoflagellates and a freshwater cyanobacterium. In addition, conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 by SxtT with VanB was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a biosynthetic precursor of STX (1), and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylation proceed after cyclization in STX biosynthesis.







Abstract
Saxitoxin (STX, 1) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;decarbamoyloxySTX (dd&#8208;doSTX, 2), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 4), and doSTX (5), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high&#8208;resolution LCMSMS. dd&#8208;doSTX (2) and 12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX (3) were identified in the PSTs&#8208;producing dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella, A. pacificum, and/or Gymnodinium catenatum) and in the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum circinale (TA04). doSTX (5), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate G. catenatum, was also identified in D. circinale (TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis, was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxitoxin (STX, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12-dideoxy-decarbamoyloxySTX (dd-doSTX, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;-deoxy-doSTX (12&#946;-d-doSTX, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 12&#945;-deoxy-doSTX (12&#945;-d-doSTX, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and doSTX (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high-resolution LCMSMS. dd-doSTX (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and 12&#946;-d-doSTX (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) were identified in the PSTs-producing dinoflagellates (&lt;i&gt;Alexandrium catenella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. pacificum&lt;/i&gt;, and/or &lt;i&gt;Gymnodinium catenatum&lt;/i&gt;) and in the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Dolichospermum circinale&lt;/i&gt; (TA04). doSTX (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate &lt;i&gt;G. catenatum&lt;/i&gt;, was also identified in &lt;i&gt;D. circinale&lt;/i&gt; (TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis, was confirmed. These results support that &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side-chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H activation/C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of novel spirocyclic &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids, is reported. This approach shows wide substrate scope of CF3&#8208;ynones and ketimines. In addition, several natural products and biologically relevant molecules, prepared by this method, can be further functionalized. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures can be successfully assembled with this spirocyclic amino acid.







Abstract
The first synthesis of unnatural &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with a spirocyclic backbone by one&#8208;pot protocol has been presented. This reaction features wide functional group tolerance and feasibility of post&#8208;functionalization of natural products and biologically important molecules. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures were assembled using this newly developed &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acid in high efficiency. The combination of C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids would trigger more promising synthetic routes for this compound.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of the Nonreducing Hexasaccharide Fragment and the Dodecasaccharide Scaffold of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of properly protected dodecasaccharide backbone of axinelloside A was accomplished by virtue of an Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The 1,2&#8208;cis configuration of the glycosidic bonds was well controlled by judicious choice of protecting groups as well as promotion conditions.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide. The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.

         <title>Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL: A novel phosphinidene transfer reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallaphosphene 1 serves as a phosphinidene transfer reagent in reactions with RNHCs and isonitriles, to give RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes 2 and 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes 3, respectively. NHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidene 2&#8201;b reacted with THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 with selective B&#8722;H bond activation to the unique NHC&#8208;stabilized borane complex 4.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2; Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes RNHC (RNHC=[CMeN(R)]2C; R=Me, iPr) to RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes RNHC&#8594;PGa(Cl)L (R=Me 2&#8201;a, iPr 2&#8201;b) and with isonitriles RNC (R=iPr, Cy) to 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes L(Cl)GaP=C=N&#8722;R (R=iPr 3&#8201;a, Cy 3&#8201;b), respectively. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b possess two localized lone pair of electrons, whereas 3&#8201;a/3&#8201;b only show one localized lone pair as was reported for gallaphosphene 1. 2&#8201;b reacts with 2.5&#8197;equivalents of a borane (THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) to the NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene&#8208;borane complex [iPrNHC&#8594;P(BH2)]2(BH3)3 4 with concomitant formation of LGa(H)Cl 5. 2&#8211;5 are characterized by heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).

The algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin was stereoselectively synthesized by implementing an IrI&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective polyene cyclization. A TMS group tracelessly directed the regioselectivity. (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin is secreted by bacteria associated with the green seaweed Ulva and forms a stable 2:1 FeIII complex that the algae take up, selectively promoting their massive development.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash monitoring approach led to the direct observation of reactive intermediates in anionic polymerization. By using flow microreactors and in&#8208;line spectroscopic devices, the living ends of anionic polymerization could be analyzed by FTIR within milliseconds to seconds of their generation. Precise control of the reaction temperature and time revealed the stability of these reactive species, enabling an efficient block&#8208;copolymerization. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Nagaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303774).

         <title>A Powerful P&#8722;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New catalytic possibilities in the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes serve as an expansion in addition to established methods based on chiral auxiliaries. Stereoselective transformations into valuable building blocks facilitate catalyst design for use in organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;based applications. Here, we present the main achievements of the last decades regarding synthesis, stereocontrolled reactivities, and catalytic applications of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8722;N&#8208;based compounds.







Abstract
For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8722;P+&#8722;X&#8722; (X=O, S, BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C=C, C=N, and C=O double bonds were feasible with selected P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus&#8208;centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.

         <title>Hydroxytrifluoroethylation and Trifluoroacetylation Reactions via SET Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 18, March 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review we present the recent methods available in the literature for the direct introduction of hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups in organic molecules governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.







Abstract
Hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups are of utmost importance in biologically active compounds, but methods to tether these motifs to organic architectures have been limited. Typically, the preparation of these compounds relied on the use of strong bases or multistep routes. The renaissance of radical chemistry in photocatalytic, transition metal mediated, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have allowed the installation of these medicinally relevant fluorinated motifs. This review provides an overview of the methods available for the direct synthesis of hydroxytrifluoroethyl&#8208; and trifluoroacetyl&#8208;derived compounds governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.

This review summarizes the multifaceted role of metal clusters in advancing solar cell technologies, including the use as electron transport materials, interfacial modiifers, molecular precursors to prepare the inorganic materials and photosensitizers in solar cells. The diverse and pivotal roles of metal clusters underscore their significance in driving innovation across different facets of solar cell technology.







Abstract
As a multifunctional material, metal clusters have recently received some attention for their application in solar cells.This review delves into the multifaceted role of metal clusters in advancing solar cell technologies, covering diverse aspects from electron transport and interface modification to serving as molecular precursors for inorganic materials and acting as photosensitizers in metal&#8208;cluster sensitized solar cells (MCSSCs). The studies conducted by various researchers illustrate the crucial impact of metal clusters, such as gold nanoclusters (Au NCs), on enhancing solar cell efficiency through size&#8208;dependent effects, distinct interface behaviors, and tailored interface engineering. From optimizing charge transfer rates to improving light absorption and reducing carrier recombination, metal clusters prove instrumental in shaping the landscape of solar energy conversion.The promising performance of metal&#8208;cluster sensitized solar cells, coupled with their scalability and flexibility, positions them as a exciting avenue for future clean energy applications. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued interdisciplinary research and technological innovation to unlock the full potential of metal clusters in contributing to sustainable and high&#8208;performance solar cells.

         <title>Bacteria at Work &#8211; Experimental and Theoretical Studies Reveal the Catalytic Mechanism of Ectoine Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ectoine is a compound gaining popularity in recent years, having unique moisturizing and cell&#8208;protective properties. This osmolyte is produced by many bacteria species via the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, the final stage of which is&#160;catalyzed by Ectoine Synthase (EctC). Here, the catalytic mechanism of EctC is proposed, supported by theoretical (QM/MM) and experimental studies (Mossbauer spectroscopy).







Abstract
Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu57, Tyr84 and His92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe2+&#8208;cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.

         <title>Tryptophan&#8208;Doped Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films with Ultralong&#8208;Lifetime Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Color&#8208;Tunable Afterglow Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(vinyl alcohol) films doped with eight different tryptophan derivatives have been shown to exhibit ultralong phosphorescence emission under ambient conditions. The afterglow color of the films can be adjusted through a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process.







Abstract
The development of a persistent luminescence system with long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable afterglow at room temperature represents a challenge, largely due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathway. In this study, an ultralong&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system has been achieved using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding strategy where poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices were doped with tryptophan (Trp) derivatives. The PVA film doped with N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(9&#8208;Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan (Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) exhibited a long&#8208;lived phosphorescence emission of up to 3859.70&#8197;ms, and a blue afterglow for a duration greater than 34&#8197;s, under ambient conditions. The introduction of two other fluorescent dyes (i.&#8201;e., Rhodamine B and Basicred14) to the PVA film facilitates adjustment to the color of the afterglow from blue to orange, and pink, by a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process. These films have been successfully applied in silk&#8208;screen printing and in multicolor afterglow light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) arrays.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Spin Regulation in Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, magnetic fields have been regarded as an effective tool to modify magnetic domain structure and change the spin multiplicity of electrons during the electrocatalysis process. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent development of spin regulation induced by the magnetic field in electrocatalysis. Finally, we point out the challenges and perspectives in spin&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of a magnetic field to manipulate spin states has emerged as a novel approach to enhance efficiency in electrocatalytic reactions, distinguishing from traditional strategies that focus on tuning activation energy barriers. Currently, this approach is specifically tailored to reactions where spin states change during the catalytic process, such as the oxidation of singlet H2O to triplet O2. In the magnetically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) procedure, the parallel spin alignment on the ferromagnetic catalyst was induced by the external magnetic field, facilitating the triplet O&#8722;O bonding, which is the rate limiting step in OER. This review centers on recent advancements in harnessing external magnetic fields to enhance OER performance, delving into mechanistic approaches for this magnetic promotion. Additionally, we provide a summary of magnetic field application in other electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.

Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR has opened the door to probing the structures of protein in&#8197;situ at atomic resolution. Here we discuss the methodologies&#8217; state of the art, current bottlenecks, and present possible solutions to the latter ranging from application of novel biochemical approaches to purely spectroscopic considerations.







Abstract
Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR is emerging as a powerful technique for probing the structural properties of conformationally homogenous and heterogenous biomolecular species irrespective of size at atomic resolution within their native environments. Herein we detail advancements that have made acquiring such data, specifically within the confines of intact bacterial and eukaryotic cell a reality and further discuss the type of structural information that can presently be garnered by the technique's exploitation. Subsequently, we discuss bottlenecks that have thus far curbed cellular DNP&#8208;ssNMR's broader adoption namely due a lack of sensitivity and spectral resolution. We also explore possible solutions ranging from utilization of new pulse sequences, design of better performing polarizing agents, and application of additional biochemical/ cell biological methodologies.

         <title>Leveraging Halogen Interactions for a Supramolecular Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal is observed. The supramolecular nanotube growth is templated by intermolecular halogen interactions between individual macrocycles encoded directly in their structure creating a well defined nanochannel.







Abstract
We demonstrate the formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal by balancing the hydrogen bonds and halogen interactions between individual macrocycles. Thereby, we template the supramolecular nanotube growth by intermolecular interactions encoded directly in the macrocycles instead of those provided by the crystallization solvent. Ultimately, we show that replacing bromines for iodines in the macrocycle is necessary to achieve this supramolecular organization by enhancing the strength of the halogen interactions and concomitant reduction of the detrimental hydrogen bonds. We investigated the nature and the interplay of the individual intermolecular interactions by analysis of the experimental single crystal data and quantum chemical calculations. This work enriches the available toolbox of supramolecular interactions and will aid and abet the development of rationally&#8208;designed materials with a long&#8208;range 1D tubular organization.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate the formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal by balancing the hydrogen bonds and halogen interactions between individual macrocycles. Thereby, we template the supramolecular nanotube growth by intermolecular interactions encoded directly in the macrocycles instead of those provided by the crystallization solvent. Ultimately, we show that replacing bromines for iodines in the macrocycle is necessary to achieve this supramolecular organization by enhancing the strength of the halogen interactions and concomitant reduction of the detrimental hydrogen bonds. We investigated the nature and the interplay of the individual intermolecular interactions by analysis of the experimental single crystal data and quantum chemical calculations. This work enriches the available toolbox of supramolecular interactions and will aid and abet the development of rationally-designed materials with a long-range 1D tubular organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Parametric Analysis of Donor Activation for Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of complex oligosaccharides relies on efficient and highly reproducible glycosylation reactions. The outcome of a glycosylation is contingent upon several environmental factors, such as temperature, acidity, the presence of residual moisture, as well as the steric, electronic, and conformational aspects of the reactants. Each glycosylation proceeds rapidly and with a high yield within a rather narrow temperature range. For better control over glycosylations and to ensure fast and reliable reactions, a systematic analysis of 18 glycosyl donors revealed the effect of reagent concentration, water content, protecting groups, and structure of the glycosyl donors on the activation temperature. With these insights, we parametrize the first step of the glycosylation reaction to be executed reliably and efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocontrolled Binding of Styrylnaphthyridine Ligands to Abasic Site&#8208;containing DNA by Reversible [2+2] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five novel styrylnaphthyridine derivatives were synthesized and shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA), which is an important therapeutic and diagnostic target. These compounds associate with AP&#8208;DNA with binding constants of 0.5&#8211;8.4 &#215; 104 M&#8211;1 as shown by photometric and fluorimetric titrations. Specifically, these ligands bind preferentially to AP&#8208;DNA relative to regularly paired duplex DNA. As a special feature, the association of these ligands with DNA can be controlled by means of a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition. Upon irradiation at 420 nm the photodimer is formed, which does not bind to AP&#8208;DNA. In turn, the naphthyridine is regained with excitation at 315 nm. Most notably, this photoinduced deactivation and release of the DNA ligand can be performed in situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder. Overall, these results provide a promising starting point for the development of functional AP&#8208;DNA ligands whose bioactivity can be modulated by light with local and temporal control.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Peroxynitrite, [O&#8208;N&#8208;O&#8208;O]&#8211;, via a Cascade of Reactions between Ozonide and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on an unexpected reaction between ammonia and potassium ozonide dissolved in liq. NH3 resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite, [ONOO]&#8211;, which exclusively happens in the presence of a specific partially fluorinated aniline based ammonium cation. High&#8208;resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite anion in cis&#8208;conformation have been obtained. We further studied this molecule anion by single crystal Raman spectroscopy. The cis and trans isomers of peroxynitrite were analyzed computationally with respect to their relative energies, the cis&#8208;trans transition barrier and their decomposition pathways to the nitrate anion. By experimentally examining cations decorated with fluorine ligands to different degrees, we demonstrate that fluorine specific interactions play a crucial role in the unexpected formation of peroxynitrite and as a conspicuously structure directing factor for the underlying crystalline solid phases, exhibiting distinct micro&#8208;separations of fluorine and hydrogen enriched regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphoramide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Effective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective and facile synthetic routes to organic ligands, along with porous materials that exhibit exceptional gas&#8208;storage properties, promise significant industrial applications. Here, a two&#8208;step synthesis of novel organophosphorus ligands without metal catalysts is reported. These ligands serve as versatile linkers for the construction of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating various metal ions, including zinc and copper. One of the zinc&#8208;based MOFs demonstrates remarkable gas&#8208;storage properties, with a hydrogen (H2) capacity exceeding 2.5 wt% at 77 K and 100 kPa as well as a carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity exceeding 20 wt% at 298 K and 100 kPa. Furthermore, this zinc&#8208;based MOF can be synthesized through a solvothermal process on the gram scale that yields high&#8208;quality single crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>New Phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;Based Fluorophores with Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics for Highly Efficient Blue Non&#8208;doped OLEDs with Negligible Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vital to develop highly efficient non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D&#8208;A fluorophores TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO possess the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non&#8208;doped OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PO/TPA&#8208;DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468 nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4%~72.6%. Moreover, the TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based device exhibits low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03% at the high luminance of 5000 cd m&#8208;2. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non&#8208;doped OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites for Glioma Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor, is highly invasive and grows rapidly. As such, the survival of glioma patients is relatively short, highlighting the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of glioma. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the non&#8208;targeting delivery systems of contrast agents and drugs greatly hinder the effective glioma imaging and therapy. Fortunately, in recent years, investigators have constructed various biomimetic delivery platforms utilizing the exceptional advantages of biomimetic nanocomposites, such as immune evasion, homologous targeting ability, and BBB penetrating ability, to achieve efficient and precise delivery of substances to glioma sites for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this concept, we present the application of these biomimetic nanocomposites in fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi&#8208;modal imaging, as well as in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy for glioma. Lastly, we provide our perspective&#160;on&#160;this research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular Uptake of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Activated by Amphiphilic p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their ability to activate the uptake of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) into vesicles and into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells is reported. First mechanistic studies suggest that CX4&#8208;Cn are excellent to afford an efficient cellular delivery of CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by CX4&#8208;Cn, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships for calixarene&#8208;based counterion activators and show that CX4&#8208;Cn are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, CX4&#8208;C12, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP&#8208;counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of CX4&#8208;Cn for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.

         <title>CO2 photoreduction over semiconducting 2D materials with supported single atoms: recent progress and challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the face of the growing energy crisis and environmental challenges, substantial efforts are now directed toward sustainable clean energy as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels. CO2 photoreduction into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is widely recognized as a promising approach to mitigate current energy and environmental concerns. Photocatalysts comprising single atoms (SAs) supported on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials (SAs&#8208;2DSemi) have emerged as a novel frontier due to the combined merits of SA catalysts and 2D materials. In this study, we review advancements in metal SAs confined on 2DSemi substrates, categorized into four groups: (1) metal oxide&#8208;based, (2) g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based, (3) emerging, and (4) hybridized 2DSemi, for photocatalytic CO2 conversion over the past few years. With a particular focus on highlighting the distinct advantages of SAs&#8208;2DSemi, we delve into the synthesis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, their catalytic performances, and mechanistic elucidation facilitated by experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Following this, we outline the challenges in this field and offer perspectives on harnessing the potential of SAs&#8208;2DSemi as promising photocatalysts. This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for the future development of 2D photocatalytic materials involving SAs for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols and Electron&#8208;Rich Phenols with Isatin&#8208;Derived Ketimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Products with up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee were obtained in aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines using Cu(II) complex bearing binaphthyl&#8208;proline&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;based tridentate chiral ligand as catalyst. The system showed good scalability, and reaction carried out in gram&#8208;scale also provided the desired product in excellent ee.







Abstract
New chiral ligands could be obtained by introducing proline moieties and imidazoline moieties to binaphthyl skeletons. The chiral ligands exhibited balanced rigidity and flexibility which could allow the change of the conformations during the reactions on one hand, and could provide sufficient asymmetric induction on the other. The proline moiety could act as a linker connecting the binaphthyl skeletons and the imidazoline moieties as well as a coordinating group for the central metal, and the electronic and steric properties of the imidazoline groups could be carefully fine&#8208;tuned by the use of different substituents. In the presence of Cu(II) catalyst bearing such chiral ligands, aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines provided the desired products with good to excellent yields and up to 99&#8201;% ee. The reactions showed good scalability, and excellent ee could still be obtained when the reaction was carried out in gram&#8208;scale.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy for Constructing Porous Boron and Nitrogen Co&#8208;Doped Carbon as an Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst toward Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to construct porous N and B doped carbon materials (BCN&#8208;P) as efficient metal&#8208;free ORR catalysts for zinc&#8208;air battery, which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as nitrogen and boron sources. BCN&#8208;P exhibits better ORR catalytic activity than its single dopant counterpart, and even comparable to Pt/C in zinc&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Carbon nanomaterials doped with N and B could activate nearby carbon atoms to promote charge polarization through the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, thus facilitating adsorption of O2 and weakening O&#8722;O bond to enhance oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, a simple and controllable self&#8208;assembly strategy is applied to synthesize porous B, N co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;based catalysts (BCN&#8208;P), which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) as nitrogen source, and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as boron source. In addition, polystyrene microspheres are added to help introduce porous structure to expose more active sites. Benefitting from porous structures and the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, BCN&#8208;P has a high onset potential (Eonset=0.846&#8197;V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.74&#8197;V) in alkaline media. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with BCN&#8208;P shows high operating voltage (1.42&#8197;V), peak power density (128.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable charge/discharge cycles, which is even comparable with Pt/C.

         <title>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene: A Building Block for Design of Macrocycles with Excited State Aromatic Low&#8208;Lying High&#8208;Spin States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the electronic structure and (anti)aromatic character of 3,4&#8208;dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) and of macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units in their lowest&#8208;lying states of different multiplicities. The designed macrocycles exhibit very stable low&#8208;lying nonet states, which can be even thermally populated as result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent DMCB is non&#8208;aromatic in its singlet ground state (S0), lowest triplet state (T1), and lowest singlet excited state (S1), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q1) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (CBD) ring and two uncoupled same&#8208;spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q1 state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8&#8197;eV above S0, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16&#8197;eV above. The DMCB is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units, and according to our computations, two of these have low&#8208;lying nonet states (i.&#8201;e., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37&#8197;eV above their S0 states as a result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromatic character of individual 6&#960;&#8208; and 4&#960;&#8208;electron monocycles.

         <title>Socialane, a Nonaprenyl Terpene Hydrocarbon Surface Lipid from the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike insects, some of the tiny Collembola use large terpenes as epicuticular lipids. The identification and synthesis of socialane, the first cyclic regular nonaprenyl terpene from the cuticle of the springtail Hypogastrura socialis is reported. In the background, the nanostructure of the superhydrophobic collembolan cuticle is shown.







Abstract
Springtails use unique compounds for their outermost epicuticular wax layer, often of terpenoid origin. We report here the structure and synthesis of socialane, the major cuticular constituent of the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis. Socialane is also the first regular nonaprenyl terpene with a cyclic head group. The saturated side chain has seven stereogenic centers, making the determination of the configuration difficult. We describe here the identification of socialane and a synthetic approach using the building blocks farnesol and phytol, enantioselective hydrogenation, and &#945;&#8208;alkylation of sulfones for the synthesis of various stereoisomers. NMR experiments showed the presence of an anti&#8208;configuration of the methyl groups closest to the benzene ring and that the other methyl groups of the polyprenyl side&#8208;chain are not uniformly configured. Furthermore, socialane is structurally different from [6+2]&#8208;terpene viaticene of the closely related H. viatica, showing species specificity of the epicuticular lipids of this genus and hinting at a possible role of surface lipids in the communication of these gregarious arthropods.

         <title>A Chiral [2+3] Covalent Organic Cage Based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cage formed with three 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL units was prepared through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach. This architecture contains six OH functions pointing inside the cavity. Host&#8208;guest studies demonstrated enantiopreference of the cage for a chiral ammonium cation.







Abstract
A [2+3] chiral covalent organic cage is produced through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach by mixing two readily available building units, viz. an enantiopure 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diformyl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL compound (A) with a triamino spacer (B). The two enantiomeric (R,R,R) and (S,S,S) forms of the cage C are formed nearly quantitatively thanks to the reversibility of the imine linkage. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of cage (S,S,S)&#8208;C highlights that the six OH functions of the BINOL fragments are positioned inside the cage cavity. Upon reduction of the imine bonds of cage C, the amine cage D is obtained. The ability of the cage D to host the 1&#8208;phenylethylammonium cation (EH+) as a guest is evaluated through UV, CD and DOSY NMR studies. A higher binding constant for (R)&#8208;EH+ cation (Ka=1.7 106&#177;10&#8201;%&#8197;M&#8722;1) related to (S)&#8208;EH+ (Ka=0.9 106&#177;10&#8201;%&#8197;M&#8722;1) is determined in the presence of the (R,R,R)&#8208;D cage. This enantiopreference is in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Controlling the Crystal Growth of DNA Molecules via Strategic Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules remains elusive. Herein we have successfully accelerated the crystal growth of DNA molecules by introducing the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation into their stacking sites, and decelerated it by introducing the phosphorothioate. Further, we have developed a novel strategy for controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions are critical to the crystallization of biomolecules, yet the precise control of biomolecular crystal growth based on these interactions remains elusive. To understand the connections between the crystallization kinetics and the strength of intermolecular interactions, herein we have employed DNA triangular crystals and modified ones as a versatile tool to investigate how the strength of intermolecular interaction affects crystal growth. Interestingly, we have found that the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation at sticky ends of the DNA triangle could strengthen its intermolecular interaction, resulting in the accelerated formation of smaller crystals. Conversely, phosphorothioate modification could weaken the sticky&#8208;end cohesion and delay the nucleation, resulting in formation of fewer but larger crystals. In addition, these modification effects were consistently observed in the crystallization of a DNA decamer. In one word, our experimental results demonstrate that the strength of intermolecular interaction directly impacts crystal growth. It suggests that 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation and phosphorothioate modification represents a rational strategy for controlling DNA molecules grow into desired crystals and it also facilitates structural determination.

         <title>Replacement of Toxic Hydrazines in Satellite Propulsion with Greener Dinitramide&#8208;based Energetic Ionic Liquid Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Grown on the Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide to Realize High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Glucose Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are provided with high specific surface area and redox activity that are widely used in electrochemistry. Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) perfectly combine the structural controllability of organic materials with the long&#8208;range ordering of inorganic materials that possess the characteristic of high electron mobility. Based on the above considerations, the combination of Ni(OH)2 and Ni&#8208;HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) as an electrode modification material is designed to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, to improve glucose detection, a sequence of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M = Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH = layered double hydroxide) are successfully synthesised by doping metals into Ni&#8208;HHTP and Ni(OH)2, respectively. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of the Neutral [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) Radical by Hetero&#8208;Bimetal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) (named &#8220;rosarin&#8221;) in its 25&#960; radical state is achieved using a hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination strategy. The antiaromatic BF2 complex B&#8208;1 was first synthesized, and then rhodium ion was inserted into B&#8208;1 to produce the BF2/Rh(CO)2 mixed complex Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 as a highly air&#8208;stable radical. The structures of B&#8208;1 and Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, and the antiaromatic or radical character was identified by various spectroscopy evidence and theoretical calculations. Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 exhibits excellent redox properties, enabling amphoteric aromatic&#8208;antiaromatic conversion to their 24/26&#960; states. Compared to the 24/26&#960; conjugation systems on the same skeleton, Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 has the narrowest electrochemical and optical band gaps, with the longest absorption band at 1010 nm. The ring&#8208;current analysis reveals intense paratropic currents for B&#8208;1 and co&#8208;existing diatropic&#8208;paratropic currents for Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1. This hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination system provides a novel platform for organic radical stabilization on porphyrinoids, showing the prospect of modulating ligand oxidation states through rational coordination design.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Red&#8208;Absorbing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct (DASA), a class of push&#8208;pull negative photochromes, has received large interest lately owing to its versatile synthesis, modularity and excellent photoswitching in solutions. From a technological perspective, it is imperative for this class of photoswitches to work robustly in solid state, e.g. thin films. We feature a molecular framework for the optimized design of DASAs by introducing a new thioindoline donor (D3) and assessing its performance against known 2nd generation indoline&#8208;based donors. The systematic structure&#8208;function investigations suggest that to achieve robust reversible photoswitching, a ground state with low charge separation is desired. DASAs with stronger electron donors and a larger charge separation in the ground state result in a low population of the photothermalstationary state (PTSS) and reduced photostability. The DASA with thioindoline donor (D3A3) seems to be a special case among the donor series as it causes a red shift (ca. 15 nm), however with less polarization of the ground state and marginally better photostability as compared to the unsubstituted 2&#8208;methyl indoline (D1A3). We also emphasize the consideration of the key additional factors that can modulate the red&#8208;light photoswitching properties of DASA chromophores in polymer thin films, which might not be dominant in homogenous solution state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxane Shuttle for Chloride&#8208;Selective Optical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported. The rotaxane was synthesised via a chloride ion template&#8208;directed cyclisation of an isophthalamide macrocycle around a multi&#8208;station axle containing peripheral naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations and a halogen bonding (XB) bis(iodotriazole) based station. Proton NMR studies indicate the macrocycle resides preferentially at the NDI stations in the free rotaxane, where it is stabilised by aromatic donor&#8208;acceptor charge transfer interactions between the axle NDI and macrocycle hydroquinone moieties. Addition of chloride ions in an aqueous&#8208;acetone solvent mixture induces macrocycle translocation to the XB anion binding station to facilitate the formation of convergent XB&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Cl&#9472; and hydrogen bonding HB&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Cl&#9472; interactions, which is accompanied by a reduction of the charge&#8208;transfer absorption band. Importantly, little to no optical response was induced by addition of bromide or iodide to the rotaxane, indicative of the size discriminative steric inaccessibility of the interlocked cavity to the larger halides, demonstrating the potential of using the mechanical bond effect as a potent strategy and tool in chloride&#8208;selective chemo&#8208;sensing applications in aqueous containing solvent environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interconversion of N2H2 and N2 is probed using &#956;&#8208;N2H2 iron&#8208;sulfur complexes. An intermediate trapped at low temperature was formerly presumed to be a &#956;&#8208;N2 species, but new in&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterization shows a new assignment. Our results are used to predict requirements to observe iron&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based reversible proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Biological N2 reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/ protonation of bridging N2 through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2 fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1=tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2 complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature. Also, PCET from the bridging diazene is highly exergonic as a result of the high Fe3+/2+ redox potential, indicating that the reverse N2 protonation would be too endergonic to proceed. This system establishes the &#8220;ground rules&#8221; for designing reversible N2/N2H2 interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.

Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two-electron oxidation of [{Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(PPr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C as [{Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(PPr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature. Also, PCET from the bridging diazene is highly exergonic as a result of the high Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+/2+&lt;/sup&gt; redox potential, indicating that the reverse N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protonation would be too endergonic to proceed. This system establishes the &#8220;ground rules&#8221; for designing reversible N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Access to N,O&#8208;Acetals from Enamides by Means of Electron&#8208;Poor Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamides can be converted into their N,O&#8208;acetals using just electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimides together with light, without the need for thiophenol as additive or strong acids as catalyst.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;acetals are found as structural motifs in natural products and are important synthetic precursors for N&#8208;acylimines as building blocks in organic synthesis for C&#8722;C&#8208;bond formation and amines. For the synthesis of N,O&#8208;acetals, an acid&#8208;, base&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic method is reported applying N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide and N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;2,5,8,11&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide as extremely electron&#8208;deficient photocatalysts. The first perylene bisimide highly selectively photocatalyzes the formation of the N,O&#8208;acetals as products in high yields, and the second and more electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide allows these reactions without thiophenol as an H&#8208;atom transfer reagent. Calculated electron density maps support this. The reaction scope comprises different substituents at the nitrogen of the enamides and different alcohols as starting material. Dehydroalanines are converted to non&#8208;natural amino acids which shows the usefulness of this method for organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate simulation models are established and developed to investigate Fe doping profile on current collapse in GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). By controlling Fe doping profile in GaN buffer layer, current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) of GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#9653;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#9653;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#9653;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%. The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.

         <title>A Study on Auto&#8208;Catalysis and Product Inhibition: A Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction Catalysed within the Cavity of an Octanuclear Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octanuclear cubic coordination cage catalyses the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a cavity&#8208;bound guest, 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). The product 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP) remained bound within the cavity, providing both autocatalysis in the early stages and inhibition in the late stages of the reaction. A red&#8208;shift in the UV/Vis spectrum revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host to guest binding, this was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis.







Abstract
The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH&#8197;8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 22, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH&#8197;8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and was also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8211;Driven Self&#8211;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymers, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures.







Abstract
With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8211;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.

         <title>Scope and Limitations of Using Microemulsions for the Covalent Patterning of Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the scope and limitations of using microemulsions (MEMs) as templates to pattern graphene covalently. This methodology is very simple and can be used to obtain functionalization in either the major (out&#8208;patterning) or the minor (in&#8208;patterning) components of the MEM.







Abstract
Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#956;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Containing Bis(squaraine) Dyes: Design, Synthesis and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three azulene&#8208;containing bis(squaraine) dyes were synthesized, among which BSQ1 showed distinct aggregation behaviors from the other two dimers and demonstrated excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. In nanoparticles, BSQ1 formed J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 displayed H&#8208;aggregates. In films, BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures upon thermal annealing with improved charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
The relationship among chemical structure, physicochemical property and aggregation behavior of organic functional material is an important research topic. Here, we designed and synthesized three bis(squaraine) dyes BSQ1, BSQ2 and BSQ3 through the combination of two kinds of unsymmetrical azulenyl squaraine monomers. Their physicochemical properties were investigated in both molecular and aggregate states. Generally, BSQ1 displayed different assembly behaviors from BSQ2 and BSQ3. Upon fabrication into nanoparticles, BSQ1 tend to form J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 tend to form H&#8208;aggregates in aqueous medium. When in the form of thin films, three bis(squaraine) dyes all adopted J&#8208;aggregation packing modes while only BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures as well as the improvement in the carrier mobilities upon thermal annealing. Our research highlights the discrepancy of aggregation behaviors originating from the molecular structure and surrounding circumstances, providing guidance for the molecular design and functional applications of squaraines.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06 A mgPd&#8208;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.</dc:description>

Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and quantum chemical bond analysis of the Ti and Zr complexes reveal ligand influence on the biradicaloid character of the titanocene complexes. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy of structurally similar Ti complexes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)Ti(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] (2a), 2b, and 2c was carried out to evaluate the accessibility of an EPR active triplet state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that introduction of Ph groups renders the complexes easier to reduce. 13C CPMAS NMR analysis provides insights into the cause of the low field shift of the resonances of metal&#8208;bonded carbon atoms and provides evidence of the absence of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Ti interaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Spin&#8208;polarized&#8208;donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and nitronyl&#8208;nitroxide (NN) in which one&#8208;electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well&#8208;known for exhibiting magnetoresistance.&#160;In particular, BTBN&#160;consists of one&#160;dibromo&#8208;TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group.&#160;One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the&#160;TTF+&#8226;&#8208;oxidized &#960;&#8208;donor (D&#8208;unit)&#160;and NN (R&#8208;unit).&#160;Here,&#160;a theoretical study is conducted to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM&#8208;coupling with respect&#160;BTBN.&#160;The study is pursued via&#160;in&#8208;silico&#160;chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D/R&#8208;radicals, C&#8208;coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to minimize distortion of the BTBN &#960;&#8208;stacking.&#160;NICSiso(1)&#160;and Wiberg's Bond&#8208;Order are analyzed to assist in identifying promising candidates, since&#160;decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance diradical character and lead to larger magnetic coupling values.&#160;The most favorable diradical&#160;to replace BTBN&#160;results from using a hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene (&#8211;(H)C=C(OH)&#8211;)&#160;as coupler preserving BTBN original NN and TTF+&#8226;&#8208;units.

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of ionic Ir(III)&#8208;complexes was designed, prepared and assessed for the visible light assisted ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA). A complete experimental and mechanistic study is performed to shed light on the key factors for the proper control of the polymerization process.







Abstract
A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (CN) and the ancillary (NN) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8722; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(CN)2(NN)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, enlightened the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism of the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Multicatalytic Cerium Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Cleavage of O&#8722;H Bearing Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach toward general &#946; C&#8722;C bond scission reactions of carboxylic acids and hemiacetals is presented. The present work demonstrates the power of a multicatalytic cerium&#8208;based photoredox platform to enable direct hydrodecarboxylation of carboxylic acids as well as redox&#8208;neutral ring cleavage of lactol derivatives.







Abstract
The need for synthetic methodologies capable of rapidly altering molecular structure are in high demand. Most existing methods to modify scaffolds rely on net exothermicity to drive the desired transformation. We sought to develop a general strategy for the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds &#946; to hydroxyl groups independent of inherent substrate strain. To this end we have applied a multicatalytic cerium photoredox&#8208;based system capable of activating O&#8722;H bonds in lactols to deliver formate esters. The same system is also capable of effecting hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation reactions. Initial mechanistic probes demonstrate atomic chlorine (Cl&#8901;) is generated under the reaction conditions, but substrate activation through cerium&#8208;alkoxides or &#8208;carboxylates cannot be ruled out.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article elucidates the significant factors affecting discharge intermediates and reaction pathways of the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries and highlights a *Li2O&#8208;mediated surface lithiation mechanism.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries facilitate renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, particularly in terms of the theoretical aspect. First, the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates are highlighted, and a surface lithiation mechanism predominantly applicable to catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption is proposed. Subsequently, the modeling of the chemical potential of Li++e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage, is detailed. Finally, challenges and future directions pertaining to the further development of Li&#8722;CO2 are discussed. In essence, this concept article seeks to inspire future experimental and theoretical studies in advancing the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed for the fabrication of gradient&#8208;structured actuators with cross&#8208;link variation by using two distinct photoinitiator systems to selectively trigger thiol&#8208;ene polymerization and acrylate homopolymerization. The gradient&#8208;structured actuator undergoes bending deformation in both air and solvent environments, and can be controlled by carefully tailoring the photopolymerization conditions.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices. The most facile way for the fabrication of such materials remains to endow bilayer structures which are fabricated with the combination of active and passive layers. Although, easily fabricated, these structures suffer from the generation of stress points between connection areas. In this work we develop a method to create a thin film with controlled cross&#8208;link variation across its thickness. The cross&#8208;link gradient is achieved through polymerization induced diffusion of dithiol molecules in thiol&#8208;ene network. As a result, the film exhibits bending deformation upon illumination with light or exposure to a chemical solvent, thereby demonstrating dual responsiveness. Light actuation of the film is achieved via photothermal effects due to the incorporation of dye into the system which can absorb UV light and heat the network. While solvent induced actuation is due to anisotropic swelling. Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allows for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A density functional theory study of the ScIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation of ketones with diazo compounds unveils a novel substrate coordination mode driven by the trans influence of counterions. This sheds light on the origins of the stereoselectivity and suggests a new strategy for adjusting it. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Huang, Y.&#8208;D. Wu, and X. Zhang (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303873).

         <title>Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug development strategy: Re and 99mTc tricarbonyl complexes with a pyridostatin moiety as a G4&#8208;binding motif have been obtained through a post&#8208;conjugation strategy using Pz&#8208;COOH&#8208;M. Metalation was found to enhance the complexes&#8217; cytotoxicity in two cancer cell lines; the 99mTc congener was used to study binding and internalization. Possible uses of the complexes for DNA&#8208;interaction, cell and biodistribution studies are illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Palma, A. Paulo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400285).

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Synthesis of Cobalt Polynitrides: Unveiling Intriguing Crystal Structures and Nitridation Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we conduct extensive high&#8208;pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt&#8208;nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, first&#8208;principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high&#8208;pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs&#8208;type CoN, and marcasite&#8208;type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50&#8208;90 GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma&#8208;CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90&#8208;120 GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched&#8208;type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show &#960;&#8208;bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face&#8208;sharing (in CoN) to edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high&#8208;pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel photoswitchable ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Azobenz(metPA)2 (1) is used to prepare a [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 metallocycle (2), whose photoisomerization was characterized using static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. Optical studies demonstrate the highly quantitative and reproducible photoinduced cyclic E/Z switching without decay of the complex. Accordingly and best to our knowledge, [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 constitutes the first reversibly photoswitchable (3d)&#8209;metallocycle based on azobenzene. The photoinduced multiexponential dynamics in the sub&#8208;picosecond to few picosecond time domain of 1 and 2 have been assessed. These ultrafast dynamics as well as the yield of the respective photostationary state (PSSZ = 65%) resemble the behavior of archetypical azobenzene. Also, the innovative pump&#8208;probe laser technique of gas phase transient photodissociation (t&#8208;PD) in a mass spectrometric ion trap was used to determine the intrinsic relaxation dynamics for the isolated complex. These results are consistent with the results from femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) in solution, emphasizing the azobenzene&#8208;like dynamics of 2. This unique combination of fs&#8208;TA&#160; and t&#8208;PD enables valuable insights into the prevailing interplay of dynamics and solvation. Both analyses (in solution and gas phase) and quantum chemical calculations reveal a negligible effect of the metal coordination on the switching mechanism and electronic pathway, which suggests a non&#8208;cooperative isomerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferromagnetically coupled chromium(III) dimer shows luminescence and sensitizes photon upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There has been much progress on mononuclear chromium(III) complexes featuring luminescence and photoredox activity, but dinuclear chromium(III) complexes have remained underexplored in these contexts until now. We identified a tridentate chelate ligand able to accommodate both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III), to either access a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex depending on reaction conditions. This chelate ligand causes tetragonally distorted primary coordination spheres around chromium(III) in both complexes, entailing comparatively short excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the range of 400 to 800 ns in solution at room temperature and making photoluminescence essentially oxygen insensitive. The two chromium(III) ions in the dimer experience ferromagnetic exchange interactions that result in a high spin (S = 3) ground state with a coupling constant of +9.3 cm&#8208;1. Photoinduced energy transfer from the luminescent ferromagnetically coupled dimer to an anthracene derivative results in sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. Based on these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, dinuclear chromium(III) complexes seem attractive for the development of fundamentally new types of photophysics and photochemistry enabled by magnetic exchange interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary sites of the C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like fold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;type lectins are a large superfamily of proteins involved in a multitude of biological processes. In particular, their involvement in immunity and homeostasis has rendered them attractive targets for diverse therapeutic interventions. They share a characteristic C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain whose adaptability enables them to bind a broad spectrum of ligands beyond the originally defined canonical Ca2+&#8208;dependent carbohydrate binding. Together with variable domain architecture and high&#8208;level conformational plasticity, this enables C&#8208;type lectins to meet diverse functional demands. Secondary sites provide another layer of regulation and are often intricately linked to functional diversity. Located remote from the canonical primary binding site, secondary sites can accommodate ligands with other physicochemical properties and alter protein dynamics, thus enhancing selectivity and enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the biological response. In this review, we outline the structural determinants allowing C&#8208;type lectins to perform a large variety of tasks and to accommodate the ligands associated with it. Using the six well&#8208;characterized Ca2+&#8208;dependent and Ca2+&#8208;independent C&#8208;type lectin receptors DC&#8208;SIGN, langerin, MGL, dectin&#8208;1, CLEC&#8208;2 and NKG2D as examples, we focus on the characteristics of non&#8208;canonical interactions and secondary sites and their potential use in drug discovery endeavors.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing dimensionality in self&#8208;assembly. Toward two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different approaches to achieve 2D supramolecular polymers, as an alternative to the covalent bottom&#8208;up approaches reported for the preparation of 2D materials, are reviewed. The significance of the operation of weak non&#8208;covalent forces to induce a lateral growth of a number of self&#8208;assembling units is collected. The examples of both thermodynamically and kinetically controlled formation of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies (nanosheets, scrolls, porous surfaces) and showing elegant applications like chiral recognition, enantioselective uptake or asymmetric organic transformations. Furthermore, elaborated techniques like seeded or living supramolecular polymerizations have been demonstrated to give rise to complex 2D nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Cellular Uptake with Unnatural Amino Acid for Inhibiting Immunosuppressive Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting immunosuppressive metastatic cancer cells is a key challenge in therapy. We recently have shown that a rigid&#8208;rod aromatic, pBP&#8208;NBD, that responds to enzymes and kill immunosuppressive metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in mimetic bone microenvironment. However, pBP&#8208;NBD demonstrated moderate efficacy against CRPC cells. To enhance activity, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenylalanine (L&#8208; or D&#8208;BiP) into pBP&#8208;NBD, drastically increasing cellular uptake and CRPC inhibition. Specifically, we inserted BiP into pBP&#8208;NBD to target mOS (Saos2 and SJSA1) and CRPC (VCaP and PC3) cells with overexpressed phosphatases. Our results show that the D&#8208;peptide backbone with an aspartate methyl diester at the C&#8208;terminal offers the highest activity against these immunosuppressive mOS and CRPC cells. Importantly, imaging shows that the peptide assemblies almost instantly enter the cells and accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum of Saos2, SJSA1, and PC3 cells and at the lysosomes of VCaP cells. By using BiP to boost cellular uptake and self&#8208;assembly within cancer cells, this work illustrates an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid as a versatile and effective residue to boost endocytosis of synthetic peptides for intracellular self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acids to Their Cyclic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intramolecular electrochemical dehydration reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. This electrolysis allows dicarboxylic acids as naturally abundant, inexpensive, safe, and readily available starting materials to be transformed into carboxylic anhydrides under mild reaction conditions. No conventional dehydration reagent is required. The obtained cyclic anhydrides are highly valuable reagents in organic synthesis, and in this report, we use them in&#8208;situ for acylation reactions of amines to synthesize amides. This work is part of the recent progress in electrochemical dehydration, which &#8211; in contrast to electrochemical dehydrogenative reactions for example &#8211; is an underexplored field of research. The reaction mechanism was investigated by 18O isotope labelling, revealing the formation of sulfate by electrochemical oxidation and hydrolysis of the thiocyanate supporting electrolyte. This transformation is not a classical Kolbe&#8208;electrolysis, because it is non&#8208;decarboxylative, and all carbon atoms of the carboxylic acid starting material are contained in the carboxylic anhydride. In total, 20 examples are shown with NMR yields up to 71%.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Plasticity of a Viral Terpene Synthase, OILTS, that Shows Non&#8208;Specific Metal Cofactor Binding and Metal&#8208;dependent Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>OILTS is a viral class I terpene synthase found from the giant virus Orpheovirus IHUMI&#8208;LCC2. It exhibits a unique structure and demonstrates high plasticity to metal cofactors, allowing it to biosynthesize different cyclic terpene frameworks. Notably, while OILTS produces only (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol with the most common cofactor, Mg2+, it also biosynthesizes a different cyclic terpene, (+)&#8208;cubebol, with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, presenting a rare instance of cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme catalysis. This is the first report of (+)&#8208;cubebol biosynthesis, to our knowledge. In addition, OILTS can uptake Zn2+ as a cofactor, which is uncommon among ordinary terpene synthases. These findings suggest that OILTS's functional plasticity may benefit the virus in diverse host environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalenes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties, Conformational Issues and Charge Transfer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within this work we have investigated spiro&#8208;based tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers from racemic spiro[5.5]undeca&#8208;1,8&#8208;dien&#8208;3&#8208;one. Compared to previously described spiro&#8208;TTFs, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms have been here separated by chiral HPLC and fully characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The two types of spiro&#8208;based chiral derivatives contain either one (2) or three (1) chiral centres out of each one is spiro&#8208;type. Experimental CD, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, shows differences in the optical activity between the 1 and 2 and their intermediates. The low optical activity of 2 and 3 (spiro alone chirality) was attributed to the presence of two conformers in the solution (ax and eq) of opposite Cotton effect whereas in the case of 1 and 5 (spiro and stereogenic centres) the spiro chirality seems to be responsible of the Cotton effect in the high energy region whereas the R and S chirality in the low energy region. Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Utilization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives Composite in Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic N2&#160;Reduction to NH3 by Enhancing N2 Activation via Interaction between Au Nanoparticles and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention as a sustainable ammonia production technology, but it needs further exploration due to its slow kinetics and the existence of competitive side reactions. In this research, xAu/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) catalysts were obtained by loading gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto MIL&#8208;101(Fe) using a one&#8208;step reduction strategy. Herein, MIL&#8208;101(Fe), with high specific surface area and strong N2 adsorption capacity, is used as a support to disperse Au NPs to increase the electrochemical active surface area. Au NPs, with a high NRR activity, is introduced as the active site to promote charge transfer and intermediate formation rates. More importantly, the strong interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the electron transfer between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe), thereby enhancing the activation of N2 and achieving efficient NRR. Among the prepared catalysts, 15%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) has the highest NH3 yield of 46.37 &#956;g h&#8208;1mg&#8208;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 39.38 % at &#8208;0.4 V (vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ FTIR reveals that the NRR mechanism of 15%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) follows the binding alternating pathway and also indicates that the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) strengthens the activation of the N&#8801;N bond in the rate&#8208;limiting process, thereby accelerating the NRR process.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Sulfurdiimides are Strongly Redox Tuned</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 4&#8208; and 2,4,6&#8208;substituted diaryl sulfur diimides induce a large dependence on redox properties, such as the one&#8208;electron reduction CV waves shown here, that correlate linearly with the redox MO energies. One&#8208;electron transfers are confirmed using in&#8197;situ EPR spectroscopy, identifying radical anions that have longer lifetimes the more electron withdrawing the substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis and extensive characterization of nine aryl sulfur diimides (SDIs, Ar&#8722;NSN&#8722;Ar) are presented with a robust computational and experimental investigation of the fundamental properties of these important members of the thiazyl family of compounds, with particular attention paid to their highly tunable electrochemical behaviour. This is the first work to undertake a systematic comparison of the electrochemical profiles of a coherent series of SDIs to demonstrate and quantify the response of their reduction potentials to substituent electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing properties. This effect is found to be not only exceptionally strong, but also correlates very closely with computed orbital energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to determine the nature, localization, and qualitative lifetimes of the radical anions of SDIs. This work also addresses significant misconceptions about physical properties of SDIs. Experimental data and modern computational methods are employed to provide a resolute answer to the long&#8208;standing contention of the solution&#8208;state conformations of SDIs, and to correct historical mistakes in the assignment of infrared spectroscopic data. High&#8208;quality crystal structures of all SDIs in this work showcase the utility of the recently introduced structural refinement software NoSpherA2, enabling full anisotropic refinement of H&#8208;atoms with accurate C&#8722;H bond lengths.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Self&#8208;Supported Ge Anode for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode with enlarged surface area, enough spacing, and the shortened ions/electrons transporting path length would greatly facilitate the rapid kinetics and promote more Li ions reversibly stored in the Ge electrode during cycling, thus embrace improved energy&amp;power density and cyclability. This review highlights various strategies of constructing the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode and provides future perspectives.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shortened ions/electrons transporting distance of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode would be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge&#8208;based electrodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Bimodal use of chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: study of the position impact towards the helical screw&#8208;sense preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of a chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine residue into Aib oligomers proved its effectiveness as a bimodal moiety, acting both as controller and 19F NMR reporter of the helical screw&#8208;sense preference. By varying its position along the chain and the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping, our study revealed the stereoelectronic properties of the CF3 group enabling the control of the helical conformation.







Abstract
Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to common belief, transmetalation reactions are not simply controlled by the electronegativity difference of the involved metals/metalloids. A combination of gas&#8208;phase and solution experiments, together with quantum chemical calculations, reveals the crucial role of solvation in the transmetalation from lithium to boron. Only in the presence of solvent molecules, the reaction proceeds in the expected direction, whereas the formation of the organolithium compound is favored in the gas phase.







Abstract
In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; (pin=pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids.

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, transmetalation reactions are not simply controlled by the electronegativity difference of the involved metals/metalloids. A combination of gas-phase and solution experiments, together with quantum chemical calculations, reveals the crucial role of solvation in the transmetalation from lithium to boron. Only in the presence of solvent molecules, the reaction proceeds in the expected direction, whereas the formation of the organolithium compound is favored in the gas phase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)(Ph)Bpin]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (pin=pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)(Ph)Bpin]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl-anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl-anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Powerful Biindole&#8208;Based Inherently Chiral Selectors: Enhancing Enantiodiscrimination by Core Functionalization with Additional Coordination Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a further coordination element to biindole&#8208;based inherent chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, by exploiting their peculiar advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms in the atropisomeric core, can powerfully enhance their remarkable enantiodiscrimination performances, as shown by tests with both model ferrocenyl and NSAIDs chiral probes.







Abstract
Among inherently chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, usually resulting in very good enantiodiscrimination performances, the biindole&#8208;based family has the additional advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms with a variety of substituents with desirable properties. Aiming to evaluate the possibility of exploiting such feature to enhance the enantiodiscrimination ability of the archetype structure, a series of three inherently chiral monomers were designed and synthesized, characterised by a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric core conjugated to bithiophene wings enabling fast and regular electrooligomerization, and functionalised at the nitrogen atoms with an ethyl, a methoxyethyl, or a hydroxyethyl substituent. Nitrogen alkylation was also exploited to obtain for the first time the chemical resolution of the biindole selectors without employing chiral HPLC. The enantiodiscrimination ability of the selector series was comparatively evaluated in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral voltammetry experiments with a &#8220;benchmark&#8221; chiral ferrocenyl probe as well as with chiral non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs naproxen and ketoprofen. The large enantiomer potential differences for all probes increased in the ethyl &lt; methoxyethyl &#8810; hydroxyethyl sequence of selector substituents, supporting our assumption on the beneficial role of an additional coordination element. The powerful hydroxyethyl selector was also applied to ketoprofen in a commercial drug matrix.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been studied for room&#8208;temperature storage of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs). The RNAs loaded in COFs maintained their structural integrity when stored in ambient conditions for weeks and were found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation in the presence of RNase.







Abstract
The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.

We report a general, regioselective, and metal free &#947;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls via silyl dienol ethers that are readily prepared from simple ketones and aldehydes. The transformation displays broad scope including 27 cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes providing &#947;&#8208;fluoro compounds in 28&#8211;91&#8201;% yield. Notably, the reported conditions are also suitable for the synthesis of challenging tertiary fluorides. The regioselectivity of the reaction was studied on a series of acyclic siloxydienes and was observed to be sensitive to the conformational flexibility of the substrate. Diversification of the &#947;&#8208;fluorocarbonyls demonstrates the promise of fluorine as a stereocontrol element.

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of perfect polar dipole alignment in ferroelectric lattices of organic non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) materials demonstrates the potential for crystal engineering by rational design to craft materials with advanced optical performance. The methoxyphenyl series of acetophenone azines feature polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). These third&#8208;generation chromophores feature superior triple T&#8208;contacts and improved crystal growth, and they excel because of their enhanced NLO properties.







Abstract
An improved design is described for ferroelectric crystals and implemented with the &#8220;methoxyphenyl series&#8221; of acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystal structures of these azines exhibit polar stacking of parallel beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs). Azines 1, 3, and 4 form true racemates whereas chloroazine 2 crystallizes as a kryptoracemate. Azines 1&#8211;4 are helical because of the N&#8722;N bond conformation. In true racemates the molecules of opposite helicity (M and P) are enantiomers A(M) and A*(P) while in kryptoracemates they are diastereomers A(M) and B*(P). The stacking mode of PBAMs is influenced by halogen bonding, with 2&#8211;4 showcasing a kink due to directional interlayer halogen bonding, whereas fluoroazine 1 demonstrates ideal polar stacking by avoiding it. Notably, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines display a stronger bias for dipole parallel alignment, attributed to the linearity of the biphenyl moiety as compared to the phenoxy series of (PhO, Y)&#8208;azines with their non&#8208;linear Ph&#8722;O&#8722;Ph moiety. The crystals of 1&#8211;4 all feature planar biphenyls and this synthon facilitates their crystallization through potent triple T&#8208;contacts and enhances their nonlinear optical (NLO) performance by increasing conjugation length and affecting favorable chromophore conformations in the solids.

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazine&#8208;based mesogens with three pending discoid arms have been shown to self&#8208;organize into rectangular columnar mesophases and form gels in various solvents. The solvatochromic&#8208;, acidochromic&#8208; and metal recognition&#8208;response photoluminescence of these mesogens offer applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting and as selective metal&#8208;ion recognition.







Abstract
Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn, respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent's polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self&#8208;assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0&#8197;mg/mL). Therefore, these star&#8208;shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.

A facile and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminonaphthothiazoles from 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes, elemental sulfur, and amines. This photochemical transformation can be conducted under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst to afford various naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines in moderate to excellent yields by using air as a green oxidant.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy has been explored for the synthesis of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines through ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H sulfuration of 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes with elemental sulfur and amines under external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component reaction, which utilizes elemental sulfur as the odorless sulfur source, molecular oxygen as the clean oxidant, and visible light as the clean energy source, provides a mild and efficient approach to construct a series of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photoexcitation of reaction intermediates consisting of thioureas and DBU might be involved in this transformation.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships for Potential Inversion from Electron Acceptors Based on Thiophene&#8208;Fused Triptycene Quinones, 1,4&#8208;Diketones and their Malononitrile Adducts</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and properties of a series of 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane (TCAQ) inspired electron acceptors based on thiophene&#8208;fused quinone and triptycene motifs is presented. This has yielded insights into structure&#8208;property relationships for establishing and modulating simultaneous two electron reduction processes in TCAQ analogues. These new compounds were synthesised using a Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation between triptycene and thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarbonyl chloride. Isomeric para&#8208;quinones featuring a [c]&#8208;fused thiophene on one side and a &#946;,&#946;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;fused triptycene on the other were isolated alongside a thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;diketone which bears two triptycene fragments. Knoevenagel condensation of these products with malononitrile produced a quinoidal bis(dicyanomethylene), an oxo&#8208;dicyanomethylene and an acyclic bis(dicyanomethylene). This series of new electron accepting molecules has been studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography and the implications of their 3D structures on NMR and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results have been ascertained with conclusions underpinned by computational methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Revision of a Natural Tetrasaccharide from Starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starfish provide important saponins with diverse bioactivities as the secondary metabolites, among which 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides are commonly found. Preparation of those 1,2&#8208;trans 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high &#946;&#8208;selectivities (&#946;/&#945; = 12/1 or &#946; only) in the challenging [2 + 2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in &gt;90% yields from the 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Push&#8208;pull Bis&#8208;norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair represents a promising system for application in molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). Often, the NBD derivatives have very limited overlap with the solar spectrum, and substitution to redshift the absorption leads to a decrease in the gravimetric energy density. Dimeric systems mitigate this factor because two switches can &#8216;share&#8217; a substituent. Here, we present five new NBD dimers with red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. One dimer features the most red&#8208;shifted absorption onsets (539 nm) and a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption maximum (404 nm) for NBD systems reported so far, without compromising thermal half&#8208;life. Promising properties for high&#8208;performance MOST applications are demonstrated, such as high absorption onsets reaching 539 nm, and energy densities of 379 kJ/kg, while still maintaining long half&#8208;lives of the metastable isomer, up to 23 hours at 25 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>AuNP@ MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 nanocomposite for the valorization of nitroarene by green catalytic hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of a catalytic process is assessed based on conversion, yield, and time effectiveness. However, these parameters are insufficient for evaluating environmentally sustainable research. As the world is urged to shift towards green catalysis, additional factors such as reaction media, raw material availability, sustainability, waste minimization and catalyst biosafety, need to be considered to accurately determine the efficacy and sustainability of the process. By combining the high porosity and versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and the activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), efficient, cyclable and biosafe composite catalysts can be achieved. Thus, a composite based on AuNPs and the nanometric flexible porous iron(III) aminoterephthalate MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 was successfully synthesized and fully characterized. This nanocomposite was tested as catalyst in the reduction of nitroarenes, which were identified as anthropogenic water pollutants, reaching cyclable high conversion rates at short times for different nitroarenes. Both synthesis and catalytic reactions were performed using green conditions, and even further tested in a time&#8208;optimizing one&#8208;pot synthesis and catalysis experiment. The sustainability and environmental impact of the catalytic conditions were assessed by green metrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Centered Reactivity of a Transition Metal Bound Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN). Despite no longer exhibiting a constrained geometry when coordinated to metal centres, the P(NNN) phosphine retains its ability to activate polar E&#8722;H bonds (including those of amines and ammonia).







Abstract
The electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar (C2v symmetric) acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN), are described. On complexation to metal centers, the phosphine was found to adopt a distorted trigonal pyramidal structure with a high barrier to pyramidal inversion (22.3&#8197;kcal/mol at 298&#8197;K for Au[P(NNN)]Cl). Spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations carried out at the density functional level of theory indicate that P(NNN) is a moderate &#963;&#8208;donor, with significant &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. Despite the distortion undergone by the phosphorus atom on coordination to metal centers, the P(NNN) ligand retains its ability to react with small molecule substrates with polar E&#8722;H bonds (MeOH, NH2Ph, NH3). It does so in a concerted fashion across one of the P&#8722;N bonds, and reversibly in the case of amine substrates. This cooperative bond activation chemistry may ultimately prove beneficial in catalysis.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlation of Five&#8208;Coordinate Trigonal Bipyramidal High Spin Cobalt(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of magnetometry and multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal large positive axial zero&#8208;field splitings, D&#8217;s, for 8 and 9 (24&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 32&#8197;cm&#8722;1), and in&#8208;depth ligand field analyses on top of wave function based ab initio calculations demonstrated that the Co(II) out&#8208;of&#8208;equatorial plane distance, &#948;, determines the sign and magnitude of D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal high spin Co(II) complexes.







Abstract
Here, we combined magnetometry, multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance, and wave function based ab initio calculations to investigate magnetic properties of two high spin Co(II) complexes Co(BDPRP) (BDPRP=2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;R)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidi&#8208;nyl)methyl)pyridine, R=H for 8; R=tBu for 9). Complexes&#8197;8 and 9 featuring effective D3h symmetry were found to possess D=24.0 and 32.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively, in their S=3/2 ground states of 
. Ligand field analyses revealed that the low&#8208;lying d&#8208;d excited states make either positive or vanishing contributions to D. Hence, total positive D values were measured for 8 and 9, as well as related D3h high spin Co(II) complexes. In contrast, negative D values are usually observed for C3v congeners. In&#8208;depth analyses suggested that lowering symmetry from D3h to C3v induces orbital mixing between 
 and 
 and admixes excited state 
 into the ground state. Both factors turn the total D value progressively negative with the increasing distance (&#948;) of the Co(II) center out of the equatorial plane. Therefore, &#948; determines the sign and magnitude of final D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal S=3/2 Co(II) complexes as measured for a series of such species with varying &#948;.

         <title>TBADT&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Stereoselective Radical Alkylation of Chiral N&#8208;Sulfinyl Imines: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Diverse Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. It utilizes non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, yielding diverse chiral amines with excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This approach offers efficient access to a variety of relevant &#945;&#8208;amino acids or alcohols and 1,2 diamines.







Abstract
Herein we describe a sustainable and efficient photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. By employing readily available non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and the cost&#8208;effective TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, we successfully obtain diverse chiral amines with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This method provides an efficient approach for accessing a diverse array of medicinally relevant compounds, including both natural and synthetic &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl ethyl amines, and other structural motifs commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals and natural product.

         <title>A New Molybdenum Blue Structure Type: How Uranium Expands this Family of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding uranyl nitrate to a solution that would otherwise crystallize the MB wheel Mo154 instead directed the formation and crystallization of Mo72U8, a new MB structure type. Uranium(IV) can be used as both heterometal and reductant in the formation of Mo90U10 type MB wheels. A dehydration induced phase change leads to formation of a sheet of these wheels connected by uranyl oxygen to molybdenum bonds, the first reported of their kind.







Abstract
The assembly of molybdenum polyoxometalates (POMs) has afforded large discrete nanoclusters with varied degrees of reduction such as the ~20&#8201;% reduced molybdenum blues. While many heterometals have been incorporated into these clusters to afford new properties, uranium has yet to be reported. Here we report the first uranium containing molybdenum blue clusters and the unique properties exhibited by this incorporation. The uranyl ion (UO22+) directs formation of Mo72U8, a square POM comprised of two faces connected by eight edge&#8208;sharing molybdenum dimers. Mo72U8, a chiral cluster, crystallizes as a racemic mixture and, in the solid state, has a &#8216;negative&#8217; charge localized on one face of the cluster opposite the &#8216;positively&#8217; charged face of another cluster. Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo97U10, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo97U10 dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo90U10. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo90U10S4 which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo90U10S4 undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation&#8208;cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.

Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo&lt;sub&gt;97&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo&lt;sub&gt;97&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation-cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Coupling of Germylone with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge(0) compound 5 undergoes coupling with isocyanates to afford imine&#8208;ligated alkyl carboxamido germylenes 7 and 8. Moreover, this addition is reversible, as evidenced by an exchange reaction of 8 with p&#8208;tolyl isocyanate and by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (5, dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with isocyanates RNCO (R=4&#8208;tolyl or 3,5&#8208;xylyl) to furnish novel alkyl carboxamido germylenes 7 (R=4&#8208;tolyl) and 8 (R=3,5&#8208;xylyl), featuring a C&#8722;C bond between the former carbene carbon and the isocyanate moiety. Heating a mixture of 8 with 4&#8208;tolyl isocyanate to 100&#8201;&#176;C results in isocyanate metathesis, demonstrating reversible C&#8722;C bond formation on the reduced germanium compound. DFT calculations suggest that this process occurs via the reductive dissociation of isocyanate from 8 that regenerates the parent Ge(0) compound 5.

         <title>para&#8211;Phenylenediamine Dimer as a Redox&#8211;Active Guest for Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Para&#8211;phenylenediamine dimers with the biphenyl centrepieces form supramolecular complexes with multiple units of &#945;/&#946;/&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins and/or cucurbit[7/8]urils. Several redox agents were tested for switching between fully reduced colourless and partially oxidised deep blue diradical forms. The reducing effect of some agents was selectively inhibited by complexation with cucurbit[7]uril.







Abstract
Redox&#8211;active components are highly valuable in the construction of molecular devices. We combined two p&#8208;phenylenediamines (p&#8208;PDA) with a biphenyl (BiPhe) unit to prepare a supramolecular guest 4 consisting of three binding sites for cucurbit[7/8]uril (CBn) and/or cyclodextrins (CD). Supramolecular properties of 4 were investigated using NMR, UV&#8208;vis, mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our analysis revealed that 4 forms higher&#8211;order host&#8211;guest complexes, wherein a CD unit occupies the central BiPhe site, secured by two CBn units at the terminal p&#8208;PDA sites. Additionally, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CD, a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex with &#947;&#8208;CD and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with CB7 and CB8 were identified. Through UV&#8208;vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of 4 are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised 4 from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by 4 render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Structural, Optical and Magnetic Modifications in Lanthanide SMMs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets are fascinating objects that break magnetic performance records with observable magnetic bistability at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, paving the way for potential applications in high&#8208;density data storage. The switching of lanthanide SMM has been successfully achieved using several external stimuli such as redox reaction, pH titration, light irradiation or solvation/desolvation thanks to the high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to any structural change in the lanthanide surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of applied high pressure as an external stimulus is largely underused, especially considering that it can be combined with high pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction to establish a complementary structure&#8208;property relationship. This Concept article summarizes the few relevant examples of investigations of lanthanide SMMs under applied high pressure, provides conclusions on the effect of such stimulus on molecular structures and magnetic anisotropy, and finally draws perspective on the future development of magnetic measurements under applied pressure.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal reactions emerged a decade ago as a novel strategy to implement spatiotemporal control over enzymatic functions and pharmacological interventions. The use of this methodology in experimental therapy is driven by the ambition of improving the tolerability and PK properties of clinically&#8208;used therapeutic agents. The preclinical potential of bioorthogonal catalysis has been validated in vitro and in vivo with the in situ generation of a broad range of drugs, including cytotoxic agents, anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics. In this article, we report our investigations towards the preparation of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I)&#8208;microdevices and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. A range of ligand&#8208;functionalized polymeric devices and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. Last, we present a preliminary exploration of their use for the synthesis of PROTACs through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatizing Cyclizations of 5&#8208;Arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Samarium Diiodide &#8211; A Computational Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study analyzes the samarium diiodide&#8208;promoted cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones to dearomatized bicyclic products utilizing density functional theory. The reaction involves a single electron transfer to the carbonyl group, which occurs synchronously with the rate determining cyclization event, and a second subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. These redox reactions are accurately computed employing small core pseudo potentials explicitly involving all f&#8208;electrons of samarium. Comparison of the energies of the possible final products rules out thermodynamic control of the observed regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Kinetic control via appropriate transition states is correctly predicted, but to obtain reasonable energy levels the influence of the co&#8208;solvent hexamethylphosphortriamide has to be estimated by using a correction term. The steric effect of the bulky samarium ligands is decisive for the observed stereoselectivity. Carbonyl groups in para&#8208;position of the aryl group change the regioselectivity of the cyclization and lead to spiro compounds. The computations suggest again kinetic control of this deviating outcome. However, the standard mechanism has to be modified and the involvement of a complex activated by two SmI2 moieties is proposed in which two electrons are transferred simultaneously to form the new C&#8211;C bond. Computation of model intermediates show the feasibility of this alternative mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Oriented Asymmetric Catalysis: Conformational Modulation of Transition State Multivalency during a Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Assembly of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Atropisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of superbasic, bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts is presented, which enables the organocatalytic, atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral quinazolinediones. Computational modeling unveiled the conformational modulation of the catalyst by a novel phenyl urea N&#8208;cap, that preorganizes the structure into the active, folded state. A previously unanticipated noncovalent interaction involving a difluoroacetamide acting as a hybrid mono&#8208; or bidentate hydrogen bond donor emerged as a decisive control element inducing atroposelectivity. These discoveries spurred from a scaffold&#8208;oriented project inspired from a fascinating investigational BTK inhibitor featuring two stable chiral axes and relies on a mechanistic framework that was foreign to the extant lexicon of asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cavity Catalysis of an Enantioselective Reaction under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity catalysis: Vibro&#8208;polaritonic states influence an enantioselective reaction under strong coupling. An increase in the conversion yield is obtained by coupling the carbonyl band of the reactant to an infrared cavity without affecting the enantiomeric excess. These experiments underline the use of polaritonic chemistry for selective control of chemical reactions by coupling to vacuum fluctuations.







Abstract
Strong light&#8208;matter interaction is emerging as an exciting tool for controlling chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an L&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric Aldol reaction under vibrational strong coupling. Both the reactants (4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone) carbonyl bands are coupled to an infrared photon and react in the presence of L&#8208;proline. The reaction mixture is eluted from the cavity, and the conversion yields and enantiomeric excess are quantified using NMR and chiral HPLC. The conversion yields increase by up to 90&#8201;% in ON&#8208;resonance conditions. Interestingly, a large increase in the conversion yield does not affect the enantiomeric excess. Further control experiments were carried out by varying the temperature, and we propose that the rate&#8208;limiting step may not be the deciding factor in enantioselectivity. Whereas the formation of the enamine intermediate is modified by cavity coupling experiments. For this class of enantioselective reactions, strong coupling does not change the enantiomeric excess, possibly due to the large energy difference in chiral transition states. Strong coupling can boost the formation of enamine intermediate, thereby favouring the product yield. This gives more hope to test polaritonic chemistry based on enantioselective reactions in which the branching ratios can be controlled.

         <title>Photosensitizers Enable the Formation of Biphenyls with UV&#8208;LEDs and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significantly improved method for metal&#8208;free biaryl synthesis through the photochemical extrusion of traceless linkers (photosplicing) is presented. An array of aldehydes and ketones have been identified as powerful photosensitizers that eliminate the requirement for UV&#8722;C light, allowing the use of UV LEDs and even sunlight. This advancement not only simplifies the reaction setup but also enables the scalable production of biphenyls.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of biphenyls, which are economically important pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and liquid crystals, is a challenging task. Current methods rely on metal&#8208;dependent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which unfortunately require the use of harmful halogenated aryls and heavy metal catalysts that are toxic and difficult to remove from the final products. Recently, we have circumvented these problems by developing a metal&#8208;free and broadly applicable photochemical method for biphenyl synthesis using UV&#8722;C light, called photosplicing. Here we present an improved method using photosensitizers in combination with UV&#8722;B, UV&#8722;A light, or sunlight. Using a high&#8208;precision flow reactor with deep&#8208;UV LEDs, we investigated the ability of commonly available organic photosensitizers to enhance the photosplicing reaction and identified a number of suitable photosensitizers with the required triplet energy. This method allows for easy batch synthesis of biaryls in borosilicate glassware and paves the way for their large&#8208;scale production without the need for flow reactors.

         <title>Bending a Cumulene with Electrons: Stepwise Chemical Reduction and Structural Study of a Tetraaryl[4]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bend or not to bend? The chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene using cesium gives the mono&#8208; and doubly&#8208;reduced cumulenes. Crystallographic analysis reveals dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene with cesium metal was explored, and the structural changes stemming from electron acquisition are detailed using X&#8208;ray crystallography. It is found that the [4]cumulene undergoes dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar. The structural deformation is consistent with early theoretical reports that suggest that the twisting should occur upon reduction of both even and odd [n]cumulenes. The current results, on the other hand, are inconsistent with a previous experimental study of a [3]cumulene in which the predicted twisting is not observed upon reduction. DFT calculations reveal that the barrier to deformation is an order of magnitude lower in a [3]cumulene than a [4]cumulene, allowing the barrier to be overcome in the solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8208;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8208;C(&#945;)&#8208;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.</dc:description>

         <title>64  Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis&#8208;pyridine derivative, which are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities &gt; 200 MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum and SOD demonstrate high stability and inertness of the 64Cu&#8208;bispidine complexes. Biodistribution studies performed in Wistar rats indicate a rapid renal elimination for both 64Cu&#8208;labeled chelates. The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl&#8208;NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS&#8208;functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor&#8208;bearing mice showed very good and specific accumulation of the 64Cu&#8208;labeled TMs in tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organocatalytic Highly Enantioselective Stereospecific Synthesis of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dihydroisobenzofurans</title>

         <dc:description>
The asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone is being disclosed. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone produce (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using two pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalysts, demonstrating excellent stereospecificity, high yields, and enantioselectivity. The resulting phthalan can undergo conversion into corresponding phthalides followed by oxidation.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael (IOM) reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone by the formation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalyst. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone provide (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran with excellent stereospecificity. In general, excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee) were obtained. Furthermore, the resulting 1,1&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran or phthalan was converted to corresponding chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides without losing the enantioselectivity. This methodology provides the core moiety of the (S)&#8208;citalopram drug.

         <title>Sniffing Out the Sustainable Future: The Renewability Revolution in Fragrance Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What will the Sustainable Future smell like? The way into a resource&#8208;friendly economy will have different impact on the various perfumery families, but it will not be an avenue to all&#8208;natural fragrances as these have the highest carbon footprint. In this report, you can find out what a world with 100&#8201;% renewable and biodegradable fragrances smells like, and which opportunities for new ingredients arise.







Abstract
In this review, the impact of the transition from today's resource&#8208;wasting petrochemical economy towards a 100/100 renewable and biodegradable future is discussed with respect to the fragrance families: &#8220;citrus&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;floriental&#8221;, &#8220;oriental&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;chypre&#8221; and &#8220;foug&#232;re&#8221;. After benchmark data on ingredients usage, definitions on biodegradation and sustainability are given. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of synthetic vanillin, its historic synthesis from renewable starting materials serves as introduction. In the grand scheme of things, citrus scents upcycled from the beverages industry, are already an ideal case for 100/100 with new opportunities for artificial essential oils. In the fruity domain, transparent and lactonic ingredients are available in a sustainable manner. However, in the domain of green odorants, there is a lack of green chemistry for important key materials. In the floral family, renewability is more critical than biodegradability, but cost is an issue. Thanks to Ambrox and maltol, florientals and orientals will persist, while woody notes severely lack an Iso E Super replacer. In the chypre genre, patchouli became the new moss, but more musks are increasingly in demand. With their high percentage of linalool and dihydromyrcenol, the construction of foug&#232;res could well become a precedent for other families, despite challenges in vetiver and salicylates. Still, the challenges exemplified here create immense opportunities for new perfumery materials.

         <title>Recent Developments of Nontraditional Single&#8208;Molecule Toroics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the nontraditional perspective, the exciting advances of SMTs are reviewed ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. The understanding of key design principles and the outlook on nontraditional SMTs will contribute to the design of novel SMTs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule toroics (SMTs), defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic ground states, are promising candidates for high&#8208;density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level have been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful in designing novel SMTs.

Nevertheless, other Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions such as Tb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Ho&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;amp;2D&amp;amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy-based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful in designing novel SMTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>QM/MM Study Into the Mechanism of Oxidative C=C Double Bond Cleavage by Lignostilbene&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dioxygenase</title>

Insert text for Table of Contents here: A QM/MM study on the lignin activating nonheme iron enzyme lignostilbene&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;dioxygenase is presented and shows that the mechanism is driven by electrostatic interactions in the protein pocket that trigger an early electron transfer and guides the reaction to a dioxetane intermediate.







Abstract
The enzymatic biosynthesis of fragrance molecules from lignin fragments is an important reaction in biotechnology for the sustainable production of fine chemicals. In this work we investigated the biosynthesis of vanillin from lignostilbene by a nonheme iron dioxygenase using QM/MM and tested several suggested proposals via either an epoxide or dioxetane intermediate. Binding of dioxygen to the active site of the protein results in the formation of an iron(II)&#8722;superoxo species with lignostilbene cation radical. The dioxygenase mechanism starts with electrophilic attack of the terminal oxygen atom of the superoxo group on the central C=C bond of lignostilbene, and the second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in the substrate binding pocket guide the reaction towards dioxetane formation. The computed mechanism is rationalized with thermochemical cycles and valence bond schemes that explain the electron transfer processes during the reaction mechanism. Particularly, the polarity of the protein and the local electric field and dipole moments enable a facile electron transfer and an exergonic dioxetane formation pathway.

         <title>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;Phenalenyls: the Yin and Yang of Heteroatom&#8208;doped &#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of NBN&#8208;phenalenyls are experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically investigated, shedding light on the substituent&#8208;dependent emission characteristics of these compounds. Co&#8208;aggregation of a suitable NBN&#8208; with its complementary BNB&#8208;phenalenyl in a microsuspension leads to a drastic red&#8208;shift in emission wavelength compared to the emission of an equimolar mixture in solution.







Abstract
NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN&#8208;phenalenyls 1&#8211;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron&#8208;containing building blocks (i.&#8201;e., BH3&#8901;SMe2 (1), p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB&#8208;phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl&#8208;bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl to the p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &gt;55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &lt;55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;phenalenyls 3 and 6 (in THF/H2O) shows a distinct red&#8208;shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.

         <title>Internal Vanadium Doping and External Modification Design of P2&#8208;Type Layered Mn&#8208;Based Oxides as Competitive Cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We propose a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F, featuring synergistic modification through doping and coating. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8211;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.

         <title>From Neutral Diarsenes to Diarsene Radical Ions and Diarsene Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable main&#8208;group element&#8208;centered radicals have attracted tremendous attention. We report here the synthesis and molecular structures of both an arsenic&#8208;centered radical anion and a radical cation. In addition, the synthesis of base&#8208;coordinated and base&#8208;free diarsene dications is presented.







Abstract
Diarsene [L(MeO)GaAs]2 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, 4) reacts with MeOTf and MeNHC (MeNHC=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetra&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to the diarsene [L(TfO)GaAs]2 (5) and the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L] (6). The NHC&#8208;coordination results in an inversion of the redox properties of the diarsene 4, which shows only a reversible reduction event at E1/2=&#8722;2.06&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1, whereas the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene 6 shows a reversible oxidation event at E1/2=&#8722;1.31&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1. Single electron transfer reactions of 4 and 6 yielded [K[2.2.2.]cryp][L(MeO)GaAs]2 (8) and [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)&#8208;Ga(OMe)L][B(C6F5)4] (9) containing the radical anion [L(MeO)GaAs]2&#8901;&#8722; (8&#8901;&#8722;) and the NHC&#8208;coordinated radical cation [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L]&#8901;+ (9&#8901;+), respectively, while the salt&#8208;elimination reaction of the triflate&#8208;coordinated diarsene 5 with Na[B(C6F5)4] gave [LGaAs]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (11) containing the dication [LGaAs]22+ (112+). Compounds 1&#8211;11 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, EPR (8, 9), IR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). DFT calculations provided a detailed understanding of the electronic nature of the diarsenes (4, 6) and the radical ions (8&#8901;&#8722;, 9&#8901;+), respectively.

         <title>Constructing Hollow Microcubes SnS2 as Negative electrode for Sodium&#8208;ion and Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change.







Abstract
Sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs and KIBs) are considered the most promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy storage fields. Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high&#8208;rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly. The in operando and ex&#8208;situ characterization provide a piece of direct evidence to clarify the storage mechanism of such conversion&#8208;alloying type negative electrode materials.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini review article provides an overview on the advantages and versatility of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis. We will focuse on the application of HICs in glycosylation, oxidation, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.
