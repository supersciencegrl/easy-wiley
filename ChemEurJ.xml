         <title>Progress in Multifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks/Polymer Hybrid Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greater than the sum of their parts: MOF/polymer hybrid materials and membranes can not only inherit the individual component's properties but also lead to some collaboratively enforced functions. This Minireview outlines some design strategies of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and their structure&#8208;function relationship, and highlights some significant recent advances in MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membrane, particularly on their application in separation, conduction, and sensing.







Abstract
The fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with customized functions and high efficiency is of great significance, but presents challenges. Emerging metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)/polymer hybrid membranes have provided bright promise as an innovative platform to target multifunctional hybrid materials and devices; this is thanks to their unique properties, which come from three components that are collaboratively enforced. This minireview provides a brief overview of recent progress in the construction of such hybrid membranes, and highlights some of their very important applications in separation, conduction, and sensing.

         <title>Lighting Up the Plasma Membrane: Development and Applications of Fluorescent Ligands for Transmembrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we overview progress made during the last two decades in small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligand design and their applications as tools using different fluorescence microscopy techniques. After a brief introduction on their drawbacks and advantages, we particularly focus on their use as versatile tools to study transmembrane proteins including the superfamilies of G&#160;protein&#8208;coupled receptor, ligand&#8208; and voltage&#8208;gated ion channels.







Abstract
Despite the fact that transmembrane proteins represent the main therapeutic targets for decades, complete and in&#8208;depth knowledge about their biochemical and pharmacological profiling is not fully available. In this regard, target&#8208;tailored small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligands are a viable approach to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Such tools, coupled with the ability of high&#8208;precision optical techniques to image with an unprecedented resolution at a single&#8208;molecule level, helped unraveling many of the conundrums related to plasma proteins&#8217; life&#8208;cycle and druggability. Herein, we review the recent progress made during the last two decades in fluorescent ligand design and potential applications in fluorescence microscopy of voltage&#8208;gated ion channels, ligand&#8208;gated ion channels and G&#8208;coupled protein receptors.

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations from the Protein Affect C&#8722;H Bond Strengths of the Substrate and Enable Negative Catalysis in the TmpA Biosynthesis Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory studies on large active site cluster models of the nonheme iron dioxygenase TmpA elucidated the origin of its chemoselectivity and identify it as negative catalysis, where an otherwise favorable channel is blocked. The enzyme succeeds in this thanks to charged residues in the substrate binding pocket, which produce a local electric dipole moment (&#956;D) and electric field and these electrostatic perturbations guide the reaction to a selective reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase 2&#8208;(trimethylammonio)&#8208;ethylphosphonate dioxygenase (TmpA) is an enzyme involved in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective hydroxylation at the C1&#8208;position of the substrate as part of the biosynthesis of glycine betaine in bacteria and carnitine in humans. To understand how the enzyme avoids breaking the weak C2&#8722;H bond in favor of C1&#8208;hydroxylation, we set up a cluster model of 242 atoms representing the first and second coordination sphere of the metal center and substrate binding pocket, and investigated possible reaction mechanisms of substrate activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species by density functional theory methods. In agreement with experimental product distributions, the calculations predict a favorable C1&#8208;hydroxylation pathway. The calculations show that the selectivity is guided through electrostatic perturbations inside the protein from charged residues, external electric fields and electric dipole moments. In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C2&#8722;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge ordered oxygen deficient perovskite in barium cobaltate system is reported with bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution comparable to that to that benchmark perovskite catalyst BSCF.







Abstract
A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO2.67 (Ba3Co3O8&#9633;1) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3&#8211;y, confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>[10]CPP&#8208;Based Inclusion Complexes of Charged Fulleropyrrolidines. Effect of the Charge Location on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positive charge on fullerene unit stabilizes the charge separated excited states of [10]CPP&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine inclusion complexes. The electron transfer occurs from [10]CPP to fullerene moiety on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The CT band of the charged complexes demonstrates the hypsochromic (or blue) shift with increasing solvent polarity.







Abstract
A number of non&#8208;covalently bound donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, consisting of C60 as the electron acceptor and cycloparaphenylene (CPP) as the electron donor, have been reported. A hypsochromic shift of the charge transfer (CT) band in polar medium has been found in [10]CPP&#8835;Li+@C60. To explore this anomalous effect, we study inclusion complexes [10]CPP&#8835;Li+@C60&#8208;MP, [10]CPP&#8835;C60&#8208;MPH+, and [10]CPP&#8835;C60&#8208;PPyMe+ formed by fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and [10]CPP using the DFT/TDDFT approach. We show that the introduction of a positively charged fragment into fullerene stabilizes CT states that become the lowest&#8208;lying excited states. These charge&#8208;separated states can be generated by the decay of locally excited states on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.

&lt;/b&gt;. To explore this anomalous effect, we study inclusion complexes &lt;b&gt;[10]CPP&#8835;Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-MP&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;[10]CPP&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-MPH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;[10]CPP&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-PPyMe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; formed by fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and &lt;b&gt;[10]CPP&lt;/b&gt; using the DFT/TDDFT approach. We show that the introduction of a positively charged fragment into fullerene stabilizes CT states that become the lowest-lying excited states. These charge-separated states can be generated by the decay of locally excited states on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mixed Cu2Se Hexagonal Nanosheets@Co3Se4 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been obtained via a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The asymmetric supercapacitor with Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode can provide wide work potential of 1.6&#8197;V, and delivers high energy density of 30.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 0.74&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a desirable lifespan (85.8&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000&#8197;charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu2Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co3Se4, Cu2Se@Co3Se4 can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as&#8208;prepared Cu2Se@Co3Se4 electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with enhanced rate capability (56&#8201;% capacitance retention at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (94.2&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, high energy density (30.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.74&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), high power density (21.0&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 7.50&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), and excellent cycling stability (85.8&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Enantiopure Polyradical Tetrahedral Pd12L6 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyradical captured in a cage: Chiral polyradical PdII tetrahedral cages supported by tris(imido)phosphate trianions and diradical dhbq..2&#8722; linkers were synthesized. DFT calculations show that these cages exhibit integer spin states and ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent radical bridges via the PdII atoms. This work provides insights into the design and synthesis of stable cage frameworks with potential in the areas of spin&#8208;electronic devices and catalysis.







Abstract
The synthesis of cages with a polyradical framework remains a challenging task. Herein is reported an enantiomeric pair of quinoid&#8208;bridged polyradical tetrahedral palladium(II) cages that are stabilized by an unusual dianionic diradical form (dhbq..2&#8722;). These cages have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy, squid magnetometry and mass spectrometry. Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;derived X&#8208;ray investigations of the iso&#8208;structural cages built on fluoranilate linkers confirm the tetrahedral structure of the obtained radical cages. Theoretical calculations showed that the diradical state of the dhbq anions is more stable than the usual monoradical state. A weak ferromagnetic exchange between adjacent radical centers was observed in DFT studies.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced N&#8722;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8722;MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based CuI&#8722;MOF, which is capable of cleaving the N&#8722;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as the O&#8722;H bond of H2O along with spontaneous H2 evolution through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations. The CuI&#8722;MOF material could be reused through simple reduction with ascorbic acid. The results showed that the CuI&#8722;MOF based on polytetrazolium ligand could be applied to activate ammonia and amine vapor in gas&#8208;solid phase.







Abstract
We report a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based CuI&#8722;MOF 1, which is capable of cleaving the N&#8722;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as the O&#8722;H bond of H2O along with spontaneous H2 evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of 1 with ammonia and water vapor, CuI&#8722;MOF 1 was gradually oxidized to NH2&#8722;CuII&#8722;MOF and OH&#8722;CuII&#8722;MOF, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that CuI&#8722;MOF could lower N&#8722;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H2 evolution by the reduction potential of 1. To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs that activate ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocin (  1  ) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin (  2  ). Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of  1  results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised  2  &#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208; coupled quinone dimer of  1  was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized ring&#8208;methylated  1  derivatives to provide stable analogs of  1  dimers able to be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally&#8208;derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of  1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although glycosylation is common in Nature, it remains a challenge for organic chemistry. Herein, a method to obtain transglycosylases from retaining glycoside hydrolases is described. The approach pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single&#8208;point mutants to assay. Invariably across six GH families, this generates enzyme variants that display increased transglycosylation yields, an improvement that is mostly due to a relative decrease in hydrolysis compared to transglycosylation. The method only requires sequence information, is fast and applicable to a broad range of glycosides.







Abstract
Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here, a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid in silico analysis of protein sequences is described. The method pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single&#8208;mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various d/l&#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and exo or endo action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.

         <title>Versatile Coordination of AgI and CuI Ions towards cyclo&#8208;As5 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homoleptic AgI and CuI coordination compounds of the cyclo&#8208;As5 complex [(Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (B) are obtained from its reaction with the M[FAl{OC6F10(C6F5)}3] (M(FAl); M=Ag, Cu) salts. Varying the ratio of the starting materials is reflected in a diversity of the isolated supramolecular assemblies (1, 3, 4) as products. The coordination mode of the cyclo&#8208;As5 units in each of 1, 3 and 4 is different revealing the pronounced adaptive coordination of B towards AgI ions.







Abstract
The reactions of the cyclo&#8208;As5 complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (B) with the AgI and CuI salts of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [FAl{OC6F10(C6F5)}3]&#8722; ([FAl]&#8722;) are studied. These reactions allow the synthesis of the mononuclear complexes [M(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;B)2][FAl] (M=Ag (1), Cu (2)) when a ratio of B/M(FAl) 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 is used. Compound 1 shows an unusual disorder of the central AgI cation between two &#960;&#8208;coordinating cyclo&#8208;As5 ligands, which is absent in 2 pointing to a weak interaction of the Ag center towards the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligands in B. When the ratio of B/Ag(FAl) is changed to 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, the respective coordination compounds [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;B)3][FAl] (3) and [Ag2(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;B)2][FAl]2 (4) are accessible. The coordination modes of the cyclo&#8208;As5 units in 1, 3 and 4 are all different, reflecting the adaptive coordination behavior of B towards AgI ions. The optimized geometries in the gas phase of 1&#8211;4 are determined by DFT calculations to support the bonding situation observed in their solid&#8208;state structures.

         <title>Radicals and Anions of Siloles and Germoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent silolyl and germolyl radicals were synthesized by reduction of sterically congested halide precursors. The radicals are pyramidalized and show only little spin delocalization.







Abstract
The synthesis of persistent sila&#8208; and germacyclopentadienyl (silolyl&#8208; and germolyl&#8208;) radicals by careful stoichiometric reduction of the corresponding halides with potassium is reported. The radicals were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and trapping reactions. The reduction of tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl&#8208;substituted halides was successful while smaller substituents (i.&#8201;e., t&#8208;Butyl, Ph) gave the corresponding dimers. The EPR spectroscopic parameter of the synthesized tetrolyl radicals indicate only small spin delocalization to the butadiene unit due to cross&#8208;hyperconjugation. Silolyl&#8208; and germolyl anions are unavoidable byproducts and are isolated in the form of their potassium salts and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The comparison of the molecular structures of two closely related potassium silolides provided an example for different coordination of the potassium cation to the silolyl anion (&#951;1 vs. &#951;5 coordination) that triggers the switch between delocalized and localized states.

         <title>Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [
]AuIII Pincer Complexes By Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first selective general procedure for the rarely investigated [
]AuIII complex class was developed. In a photochemical step, different gold(III) complexes can be easily synthesized, offering a fast entry to highly valued scaffolds for OLEDs, gas&#8208;sensors or anticancer drugs, respectively. Both (DMS)gold chloride complexes or (DMS)gold organometallic compounds can be used as starting materials introducing the gold center (DMS=dimethylsulfide), which further expands the synthetic possibilities.







Abstract
Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [
]AuIII complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only by&#8208;product. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in the case of a transmetalation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [
]Au(III) pincer complex was synthesized by using this technology.

         <title>Probing the Catalytically Active Species in POM&#8208;Catalysed DNA&#8208;Model Hydrolysis**

The catalytic effect of the [Mo7O24]6&#8722; polyoxometalate for the hydrolysis of the phosphoester bond is produced by means of decomposition of [Mo7O24]6&#8722; into [Mo2O8H4], [Mo3O8]2+ and [Mo5O15] species. Since [Mo2O8H4] is neutral after protonation in the acidic pH, its in&#8197;situ generation would explain why highly negatively charged species as polyoxometalates are able to approximate to the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis.







Abstract
Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo7O24]6&#8722; may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO4)2Mo5O15]6&#8722; product. Real&#8208;time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo5O15(pNPP)2(H2O)6]6&#8722; that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo2O8]4&#8722; anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo7O24]6&#8722; as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo5O15} species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non&#8208;catalytic effect found in experimental results.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive to be selective: Comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related biomimetic receptors toward disaccharides sheds light on the differences between a rigid macrocyclic architecture and a flexible tweezer&#8208;shaped structure showing, counterintuitively, that the adaptive structure can be advantageous in terms of selectivity. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling calculations were used to provide a 3D description of the receptor&#8208;disaccharide complexes in solution and explaining the origin of the observed selectivity.







Abstract
When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have seldom been explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezer&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.

         <title>Porous Tungsten Oxide: Recent Advances in Design, Synthesis, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top hole! This minireview summarizes the design and synthesis challenges of porous WO3 including how the different synthesis methods affect its properties, morphology and application in different fields, such as supercapacitors, catalysts, sensors, and therapeutics. The porous tungsten oxide with thorough porous channels provides abundant active sites for surface reactions.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has received ever more attention and has been highly researched over the last decade due to its being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with tunable, yet widely stable, band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights the challenges in the design and synthesis of porous WO3 including methods, precursors, solvent effects, crystal phases, and surface activities of the porous WO3 base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impact the optical properties of tungsten but also allow tuning to operate on different energy levels, which makes WO3 highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bioapplications.

         <title>Confinement inside a Crystalline Sponge Induces Pyrrole To Form N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Bonded Tetramers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external driving force from the confined space of a crystalline sponge resulted in a reorientation of the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction among pyrrole molecules. Such a confinement effect led to the formation of pyrrole dimers and also unprecedented clusters of cyclic tetramers. These results were verified by both single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational methods.







Abstract
Based on the DFT&#8208;level&#8208;calculated molecular volume (Vmol) of pyrrole and its liquid density, pyrrole manifests the highest liquid density coefficient LDc (defined as [Vmol&#215;density &#215;0.6023]/FW) value of 0.7. Normal liquids have LDc &lt;0.63. This very high LDc is due to the strong N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in solution, and hence pyrrole can be considered to be a pseudo&#8208;crystalline liquid. When trapped inside the confined space of a crystalline sponge, a reorientation of the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction is observed leading to specific cyclic N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; tetramers and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; dimers, as verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational methods. These tetramers are of the same size as four pyrrole molecules in the solid&#8208;state of pyrrole, yet the cyclic N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions are circularly oriented instead of being in the linear zigzag structure found in the X&#8208;ray structure of a solid pyrrole. The confinement thus acts as an external driving force for tetramer formation.

         <title>Multivalent Tryptophan&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing [60]Fullerene Hexa&#8208;Adducts as Dual HIV and Enterovirus A71 Entry Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene with twelve tryptophan (Trp)/tyrosine (Tyr) residues in their periphery have been synthesized. They are much potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the prototype AL&#8208;385, with the same number of Trp moieties but a smaller and flexible pentaerythritol scaffold. This finding showed the relevance of the globular presentation of the peripheral groups for inhibiting viral replication, particularly HIV.







Abstract
Unprecedented 3D hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues have been synthesized. Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes AL&#8208;385 and AL&#8208;463, which possess the same number of Trp/Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core. These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups (Trp/Tyr) as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes, particularly in the case of HIV, and support the hypothesis that [60]fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon&#8208;based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hexa-adducts of [60]fullerene&lt;/b&gt; with twelve tryptophan (Trp)/tyrosine (Tyr) residues in their periphery have been synthesized. They are much potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the prototype &lt;b&gt;AL-385&lt;/b&gt;, with the same number of Trp moieties but a smaller and flexible pentaerythritol scaffold. This finding showed the relevance of the globular presentation of the peripheral groups for inhibiting viral replication, particularly HIV.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented 3D hexa-adducts of [60]fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues have been synthesized. Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes &lt;b&gt;AL-385&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;AL-463&lt;/b&gt;, which possess the same number of Trp/Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core. These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups (Trp/Tyr) as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes, particularly in the case of HIV, and support the hypothesis that [60]fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon-based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers. In addition, the functionalized fullerenes here described, which display twelve peripheral negatively charged indole moieties on their globular surface, define a new and versatile class of compounds with a promising potential in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fundamental Characterization, Photophysics and Photocatalysis of a Base Metal Iron(II)&#8208;Cobalt(III) Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping it simple: A new dyad that is active in photocatalytic proton reduction employing only base metals has been achieved. It connects a tetra&#8208;NHC&#8208;FeII photosensitizer with a CoIII cobaloxime catalyst. The photocatalytic activity is explained by comparison to the equivalent two&#8208;component system and thorough ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state characterization.







Abstract
A new base metal iron&#8208;cobalt dyad has been obtained by connection between a heteroleptic tetra&#8208;NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]pyridine with 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This novel iron(II)&#8208;cobalt(III) assembly has been extensively characterized by ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state methods like X&#8208;ray crystallography, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro&#8208;)electrochemistry, and steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a particular focus on the stability of the molecular assembly in solution and determination of the excited&#8208;state landscape. NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy reveal dissociation of the dyad in acetonitrile at concentrations below 1&#8197;mM and high photostability. Transient absorption spectroscopy after excitation into the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption band suggests a relaxation cascade originating from hot singlet and triplet MLCT states, leading to the population of the 3MLCT state that exhibits the longest lifetime. Finally, decay into the ground state involves a 3MC state. Attachment of cobaloxime to the iron photosensitizer increases the 3MLCT lifetime at the iron centre. Together with the directing effect of the linker, this potentially makes the dyad more active in photocatalytic proton reduction experiments than the analogous two&#8208;component system, consisting of the iron photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl. This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, which are important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient absorption studies of protonated pyridine&#8208; and nitro&#8208;merocyanines reveal a pH&#8208;gated photoacidic behaviour. The O&#8208;protic site shows an ultrafast excited state super&#8208;photoacid reactivity at low pH values that is even capable of proton transfer to alcoholic solvents. Remarkably, the pyridine compound exhibits an additional N&#8208;protic site which functions as photoacid generator at pH&#8197;5.5 due to its lowered ground state pKa value after photoisomerization to the ring&#8208;closed spiropyran structure.







Abstract
Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pKa value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1&#8197;ps. With a pKa drop of 8.7&#8197;units to &#8722;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the ortho&#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present  in situ  synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S  8  results in the sublimation of S  8  , observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133 K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.</dc:description>

         <title>PorphyStruct &#8211; A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PorphyStruct  , a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the  out&#8208;of&#8208;plane  dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.</dc:description>

Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in-depths discussions of structure-function correlations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;bimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have described Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared with their homo&#8208;bimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic, UV&#8208;vis and DFT studies show only ring&#8208;centered oxidation after 2e&#8208;oxidations. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band of 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Strong electronic communication between two rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. Unpaired spins of Fe(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly anti&#8208;ferromagnetically coupled, while such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of Mn2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) complexes as compared to their Fe2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of &#960;&#8208;cation radical and Cu(II) ion is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) complex as compared to its Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively, however, the Cu(II) center acts as a charge donor in the heterobimetallic complexes while Fe(III)/Mn(III) center as a charge acceptor.</dc:description>

Abstract
What happens when a C&#8722;H bond is forced to interact with unpaired pairs of electrons at a positively charged metal? Such interactions can be considered as &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonds, which combine the familiar orbital interaction pattern characteristic for the covalent contribution to the conventional H&#8208;bonding with an unusual contra&#8208;electrostatic component. While electrostatics is strongly stabilizing component in the conventional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X bonds where X is an electronegative main group element, it is destabilizing in the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts when M is Au(I), Ag(I), or Cu(I) of NHC&#8722;M&#8722;Cl systems. Such remarkable C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction became experimentally accessible within (&#945;&#8208;ICyDMe)MCl, NHC&#8208;Metal complexes embedded into cyclodextrins. Computational analysis of the model systems suggests that the overall interaction energies are relatively insensitive to moderate variations in the directionality of interaction between a C&#8722;H bond and the metal center, indicating stereoelectronic promiscuity of fully filled set of d&#8208;orbitals. A combination of experimental and computational data demonstrates that metal encapsulation inside the cyclodextrin cavity forces the C&#8722;H bond to point toward the metal, and reveals a still attractive &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonding interaction.

         <title>Dendritic&#8208;Like Molecules Built on a Pillar[5]arene Core as Hole Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Multi&#8208;branched three&#8208;dimensional organic molecules are an appealing class of compounds that can be employed as hole&#8208;transporting materials in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, two innovative pillar[5]arene&#8208;based HTMs decorated with different triphenylamine fragments are presented. Solar cell performances, stability, and production costs have been deeply investigated with respect to the reference compound spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;branched molecules have recently demonstrated interesting behaviour as charge&#8208;transporting materials within the fields of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). For this reason, extended triarylamine dendrons have been grafted onto a pillar[5]arene core to generate dendrimer&#8208;like compounds, which have been used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for PSCs. The performances of the solar cells containing these novel compounds have been extensively investigated. Interestingly, a positive dendritic effect has been evidenced as the hole transporting properties are improved when going from the first to the second&#8208;generation compound. The stability of the devices based on the best performing pillar[5]arene material has been also evaluated in a high&#8208;throughput ageing setup for 500&#8197;h at high temperature. When compared to reference devices prepared from spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the behaviour is similar. An analysis of the economic advantages arising from the use of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based material revealed however that our pillar[5]arene&#8208;based material is cheaper than the reference.

         <title>Sustainable and Robust Graphene Cellulose Paper Decorated with Lithiophilic Au Nanoparticles to Enable Dendrite&#8208;free and High&#8208;Power Lithium Metal Anode</title>

Sustainable graphene cellulose paper decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles provides abundant nucleation sites and guarantees uniform Li deposition. And the large specific surface area of cellulose paper lowers local current density and avoids concentration polarization near the surface of electrode. Meanwhile, cellulose paper scaffold with good mechanical strength substantially alleviates the volume expansion of metal Li. Benefited from the synergy between Au nanoparticles and cellulose paper, the electrochemical performance of the Au&#8722;GCP electrode is significantly improved even at high current density.







Abstract
Lithium metal anodes (LMAs) with high energy density have recently captured increasing attention for development of next&#8208;generation batteries. However, practical viability of LMAs is hindered by the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth and infinite dimension change. Even though constructing 3D conductive skeleton has been regarded as a reliable strategy to prepare stable and low volume stress LMAs, engineering the renewable and lithiophilic conductive scaffold is still a challenge. Herein, a robust conductive scaffold derived from renewable cellulose paper, which is coated with reduced graphene oxide and decorated with lithiophilic Au nanoparticles, is engineered for LMAs. The graphene cellulose fibres with high surface area can reduce the local current density, while the well&#8208;dispersed Au nanoparticles can serve as lithiophilic nanoseeds to lower the nucleation overpotential of Li plating. The coupled relationship can guarantee uniform Li nucleation and unique spherical Li growth into 3D carbon matrix. Moreover, the natural cellulose paper possesses outstanding mechanical strength to tolerate the volume stress. In virtue of the modulated deposition behaviour and near&#8208;zero volume change, the hybrid LMAs can achieve reversible Li plating/stripping even at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as evidenced by high Coulombic efficiency (97.2&#8201;% after 60&#8197;cycles) and ultralong lifespan (1000&#8197;cycles) together with ultralow overpotential (25&#8197;mV). Therefore, this strategy sheds light on a scalable approach to multiscale design versatile Li host, promising highly stable Li metal batteries to be feasible and practical.

Natural&#8208;like &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides were accessed via Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed O&#8722;H insertion into propiolic acids followed by DIPEA&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Michael addition. The resulting spirocyclic Michael acceptors were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein cancer target. Moreover, some of these compounds were shown to selectively bind selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Diazo homophotalimides were reacted with various propiolic acids on Rh2(esp)2 catalysis. The resulting propiolate esters were transformed into novel, heterocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides in good to excellent product yields. The approach represents a fundamentally novel entry into natural&#8208;like &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides present in many biologically active natural products as well as fully synthetic compounds endowed with diverse biological activities. The &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides thus obtained were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenocysteine enzyme target for cancer. Moreover, for the best compound in the series (TrxR IC50 1.49&#177;0.08&#8197;&#956;M), by using MALDI&#8208;TOF mass&#8208;spectrometry it was shown that it selectively binds selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine. This validates the new compound as a promising lead for anticancer therapy development.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of the Degradation of Fluoroethylene Carbonate, an Additive of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries, Unraveled by Radiation Chemistry</title>

Forming an attachment: In neat fluoroethylene carbonate, an additive commonly used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, excess electrons formed upon radiolysis primarly undergo attachment rather than solvation. The formation of the cyclic radical anion is not observed when fluoroethylene carbonate is a solute in other solvents.







Abstract
Numerous additives are used in the electrolytes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially for the formation of an efficient solid electrolyte interphase at the surface of the electrodes. Understanding the degradation processes of these compounds is thus important; they can be seen through radiolysis. In the case of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), picosecond pulse radiolysis experiments evidenced the formation of FEC.&#8722;. This radical is stabilized in neat FEC, whereas the ring opens to form more stable radical anions when FEC is a solute in other solvents, as confirmed by quantum chemistry calculations. In neat FEC, pre&#8208;solvated electrons primarily undergo attachment rather than solvation. On long timescales, the gases produced (H2, CO, and CO2) were quantified. A reaction scheme for both the oxidizing and reducing pathways at stake in irradiated FEC is proposed. This work shows that the nature of the primary species formed in FEC depends on the amount of FEC in the solution.

Abstract
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. The regioselective borylation of unsymmetric diaryl sulfoxides was also feasible leading to borylation of the sterically less encumbered aryl substituent. Competition experiments demonstrated that an electron&#8208;deficient aryl moiety reacts preferentially. The origin of the selectivity in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of electronically biased unsymmetrical diaryl sulfoxide lies in the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, as oxidative addition of methoxyphenyl 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl sulfoxide to the Ni(0) complex occurs selectively to give the structurally characterized complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4){(SO)&#8208;4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4}] 4. For complex 5, the isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I was structurally characterized in which the phenyl sulfinyl ligand is bound via the oxygen atom to nickel. In solution, the complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I is in equilibrium with the S&#8208;bonded isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(SOC6H5)] 5, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal that these isomers are separated by a mere 0.3&#8197;kJ/mol (M06/def2&#8208;TZVP&#8208;level of theory) and connected via a transition state trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(&#951;2&#8208;{SO}&#8208;C6H5)], which lies only 10.8&#8197;kcal/mol above 5.

         <title>Mechanochemical Formation, Solution Rearrangements, and Catalytic Behavior of a Polymorphic Ca/K Allyl Complex</title>

Solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical synthesis provides the metastable organocalciate K[CaA&#8217;3] (A&#8217;= 1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3), whose &#8216;first contact&#8217; with solvent determines how fast it rearranges to a more stable form: minutes (in hexanes) to days (in arenes). The latter form of the calciate initiates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene under mild conditions.







Abstract
Without solvents present, the often far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium environment in a mechanochemically driven synthesis can generate high&#8208;energy, non&#8208;stoichiometric products not observed from the same ratio of reagents used in solution. Ball milling 2&#8197;equiv. K[A&#8217;] (A&#8217;=[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3]&#8722;) with CaI2 yields a non&#8208;stoichiometric calciate, K[CaA&#8217;3], which initially forms a structure (1) likely containing a mixture of pi&#8208; and sigma&#8208;bound allyl ligands. Dissolved in arenes, the compound rearranges over the course of several days to a structure (2) with only &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligands, and that can be crystallized as a coordination polymer. If dissolved in alkanes, however, the rearrangement of 1 to 2 occurs within minutes. The structures of 1 and 2 have been modeled with DFT calculations, and 2 initiates the anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene; for the latter, under the mildest conditions yet reported for a heavy Group 2 species (one&#8208;atm pressure and room temperature).

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based &#8220;Turn&#8208;Off&#8221; Probe with Broad Detection Range for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ Ions</title>

An efficient pyrene&#8208;based probe using fluorescence quenching to detect mercury, lead and copper in organic solvents with high selectivity and specificity was synthetized. The rigid tris&#8208;pyrene chromophore architecture ensures a very broad dynamic range of the sensor's response. Spectroscopic investigation elucidated the stoichiometry and mode of action and revealed a unique aggregation behavior at high analyte concentrations.







Abstract
Detection of metals in different environments with high selectivity and specificity is one of the prerequisites of the fight against environmental pollution with these elements. Pyrenes are well suited for the fluorescence sensing in different media. The applied sensing principle typically relies on the formation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular excimers, which is however limiting the sensitivity range due to masking of e.&#8201;g. quenching effects by the excimer emission. Herein we report a highly selective, structurally rigid chemical sensor based on the monomer fluorescence of pyrene moieties bearing triazole groups. This sensor can quantitatively detect Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ in organic solvents over a broad concentrations range, even in the presence of ubiquitous ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The strongly emissive sensor's fluorescence with a long lifetime of 165&#8197;ns is quenched by a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formation upon addition of metal ions in acetonitrile. Upon addition of a tenfold excess of the metal ion to the sensor, agglomerates with a diameter of about 3&#8197;nm are formed. Due to complex interactions in the system, conventional linear correlations are not observed for all concentrations. Therefore, a critical comparison between the conventional Job plot interpretation, the method of Benesi&#8208;Hildebrand, and a non&#8208;linear fit is presented. The reported system enables the specific and robust sensing of medically and environmentally relevant ions in the health&#8208;relevant nM range and could be used e.&#8201;g. for the monitoring of the respective ions in waste streams.

         <title>The Mechanism of Cleavage of RNA Phosphodiesters by a Gold Nanoparticle Nanozyme</title>

Uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;phosphodiesters are easily cleaved by gold nanozymes functionalized with Zn(II) ligands with a nucleophilic mechanism. The catalytic site requires two metal ions for catalysis and at least a third one for binding of the uridine nucleobase.







Abstract
The cleavage of uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphodiesters bearing alcohols with pKa ranging from 7.14 to 14.5 catalyzed by AuNPs functionalized with 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Zn(II) complexes has been studied to unravel the source of catalysis by these nanosystems (nanozymes). The results have been compared with those obtained with two Zn(II) dinuclear catalysts for which the mechanism is fairly understood. Binding to the Zn(II) ions by the substrate and the uracil of uridine was observed. The latter leads to inhibition of the process and formation of less productive binding complexes than in the absence of the nucleobase. The nanozyme operates with these substrates mostly via a nucleophilic mechanism with little stabilization of the pentacoordinated phosphorane and moderate assistance in leaving group departure. This is attributed to a decrease of binding strength of the substrate to the catalytic site in reaching the transition state due to an unfavorable binding mode with the uracil. The nanozyme favors substrates with better leaving groups than the less acidic ones.

The phylogenic chemical transformation approach to synthesize on&#8208;DNA 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole, 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amine and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as pluripotent precursor are reported here, which shows great potential in facilitating rapid construction of azole&#8208;focused DELs.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.

DNA-compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quadruply BN&#8208;Fused Tetrathia[8]circulenes with Flexible Frameworks: Synthesis, Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 31, Page 8178-8184, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruply BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes were synthesized through four&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulene exhibits crystal polymorphism, in which the circulene core adopts both planar and saddle conformations in the solid state. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the weaker aromaticity of azaborine compared with benzene renders the flexibility to the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes.







Abstract
Quadruply BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes were synthesized through four&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulene with peripheral phenyl groups exhibits crystal polymorphism, in which the circulene core adopts both planar and saddle conformations in the solid state. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the weaker aromaticity of azaborine compared with benzene renders the flexibility of the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes.

         <title>Unveiling the Hidden &#963;&#8208;Dimerization of a Kinetically Protected Olympicenyl Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 31, Page 8203-8213, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto undetected &#963;&#8208;dimerization pathway in an olympicenyl system was revealed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Theoretical calculations gave clear structural and energetic profiles for the &#963;&#8208;dimerization, and regioselective oxidation of the olympicenyl radical afforded biolympicenylidene with significant singlet diradical character and high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization.







Abstract
The &#963;&#8208;dimer of a kinetically protected olympicenyl radical, which evaded the experimental detection, was revealed by conversion into biolympicenylidene with E&#8208;configuration in a regioselective manner. The complicated stereochemistry and energetics of the &#963;&#8208;dimers derived from C2v symmetry and uneven spin distribution of the olympicenyl radical were revealed by the theoretical calculations, and the energetic preference of &#960;&#8208;dimer over &#963;&#8208;dimer by a minute gap was disclosed. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene, a polycyclic ene structure previously considered as reactive intermediate in the phenalenyl radical system, exhibited exceptional stability, which allowed for a detailed investigation on its singlet diradical character and physical properties by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption/emission spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and assisted by theoretical calculations. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene showed high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization reactions, which was attributed to high activation energies for the rate&#8208;determining electrocyclization operated on both disrotatory and conrotatory mode, as well as a small spin density at the bonding sites for the radical&#8208;radical coupling process.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of an o&#8208;Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted Three&#8208;Coordinate Borane Radical Anion</title>

Stabilization via three&#8208;coordinate boron allows the isolation of a paramagnetic radical anion of ortho&#8208;carborane. A photophysical, electrochemical and crystallographic study backed by DFT calculations shines light on closo&#8208;nido intermediate structures, charge transfer processes and electron accepting ability.







Abstract
Bis(1&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;carboran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;borane [(1&#8208;(4&#8208;MeC6H4)&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10&#8208;2&#8208;)2(4&#8208;MeC6H4)B] (1), a new bis(o&#8208;carboranyl)&#8208;(R)&#8208;borane was synthesised by lithiation of the o&#8208;carboranyl precursor and subsequent salt metathesis reaction with (4&#8208;tolyl)BBr2. Cyclic voltammetry experiments on 1 show multiple distinct reduction events with a one&#8208;electron first reduction. In a selective reduction experiment the corresponding paramagnetic radical anion 1.&#8722; was isolated and characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analyses allow an in&#8208;depth comparison of 1, 1.&#8722;, their calculated geometries, and the S1 excited state of 1. Photophysical studies of 1 show a charge transfer (CT) emission with low quantum yield in solution but a strong increase in the solid state. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to identify transition&#8208;relevant orbitals.

Printing of highly conductive features has found purpose across a broad array of electronics and as processing times and temperatures reduce, the avenues of application expand to low&#8208;cost flexible substrates, materials for wearable devices and beyond. Although nanoparticle (NP) inks are well known, the rise in metal&#8208;organic decomposition (MOD) inks has extended the range of compounds that can be printed, whilst simultaneously addressing shelf life and sintering issues. For more information, see the Minireview by C.&#8197;E. Knapp et al. on page&#8197;8062&#8197;ff.

         <dc:description>
Dendritic&#8208;like hole transporting materials for perovskite solar cells have been prepared by functionalization of a clickable pillar[5]arene core with triarylamine dendrons. Importantly, the apparent structural complexity of the resulting compounds is not associated to a difficult synthesis which is a major advantage for applications in the field of organic electronic materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dendritic-like hole transporting materials&lt;/b&gt; for perovskite solar cells have been prepared by functionalization of a clickable pillar[5]arene core with triarylamine dendrons. Importantly, the apparent structural complexity of the resulting compounds is not associated to a difficult synthesis which is a major advantage for applications in the field of organic electronic materials.

Let it click in UHV: a click chemistry reaction suitable for application under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions was developed based on enolether/tetrazine coupling. It is orthogonal to the strain&#8208;promoted cycloaddition of cyclooctynes to azides and allows for tailored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on highly reactive semiconductor surfaces such as Si(001) seen through the window of a UHV apparatus.

Let's play dominoes with SF6: The photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 in the presence of a&#8208;substituted styrenes and alkynols initiates a reaction sequence that consecutively forms a C&#8722;O bond, a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;SF5 bond, one after another. Finally, this domino reaction yields pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step. These new compounds bear a complex structure and broaden the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks for chemical synthesis in the future.

Sensing of metal contaminants in different environments is crucial for the control of pollution. A highly specific sensor for mercury, lead, and copper based on the interaction of pyrene&#8208;based moieties functionalized at their 2&#8208;position has been synthesized and characterized. The detection of fluorescence quenching of the monomer emission allows for a broad dynamic range and sensing is possible in organic solvents and in the presence of other cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Mg2+.

Fresh ink: This minireview considers the highlights and challenges facing both the precursor (MOD) and nanoparticle (NP) approach toward the printing of highly conductive metallic features. Silver, copper and aluminium are some of the most conductive elements and their printing has been applied to a broad field of electronics. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date synthetic routes to MOD and NP formulations are presented and compared to the fundamental requirements of an ink.







Abstract
This Minireview compares two distinct ink types, namely metal&#8208;organic decomposition (MOD) and nanoparticle (NP) formulations, for use in the printing of some of the most conductive elements: silver, copper and aluminium. Printing of highly conductive features has found purpose across a broad array of electronics and as processing times and temperatures reduce, the avenues of application expand to low&#8208;cost flexible substrates, materials for wearable devices and beyond. Printing techniques such as screen, aerosol jet and inkjet printing are scalable, solution&#8208;based processes that historically have employed NP formulations to achieve low resistivity coatings printed at high resolution. Since the turn of the century, the rise in MOD inks has vastly extended the range of potentially applicable compounds that can be printed, whilst simultaneously addressing shelf life and sintering issues. A brief introduction to the field and requirements of an ink will be presented followed by a detailed discussion of a wide array of synthetic routes to both MOD and NP inks. Unindustrialized materials will be discussed, with the challenges and outlook considered for the market leaders: silver and copper, in comparison with the emerging field of aluminium inks.

         <title>Fluorinated Azobenzenes Switchable with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 31, Page 8094-8099, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular photoswitches find rapidly growing applications in biocompatible materials and photopharmacology. ortho&#8208;Fluorinated azobenzenes bearing conjugated sp2 substituents can be effectively photoisomerized with light wavelengths above 630&#8197;nm, within the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;, which enables deep penetration of soft human tissues. This observation may therefore facilitate the design of new&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive therapeutics.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches triggered with red or NIR light are optimal for photomodulation of complex biological systems, including efficient penetration of the human body for therapeutic purposes (&#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;). Yet, they are rarely reported, and even more rarely functional under aqueous conditions. In this work, fluorinated azobenzenes are shown to exhibit efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with red light (PSS660nm &gt;75&#8201;% Z) upon conjugation with unsaturated substituents. Initially demonstrated for aldehyde groups, this effect was also observed in a more complex structure by incorporating the chromophore into a cyclic dipeptide with propensity for self&#8208;assembly. Under physiological conditions, the latter molecule formed a supramolecular material that reversibly changed its viscosity upon irradiation with red light. Our observation can lead to design of new photopharmacology agents or phototriggered materials for in&#8197;vivo use.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular photoswitches&lt;/b&gt; find rapidly growing applications in biocompatible materials and photopharmacology. &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-Fluorinated azobenzenes bearing conjugated sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; substituents can be effectively photoisomerized with light wavelengths above 630&#8197;nm, within the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;, which enables deep penetration of soft human tissues. This observation may therefore facilitate the design of new-generation stimuli-responsive therapeutics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular photoswitches triggered with red or NIR light are optimal for photomodulation of complex biological systems, including efficient penetration of the human body for therapeutic purposes (&#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;). Yet, they are rarely reported, and even more rarely functional under aqueous conditions. In this work, fluorinated azobenzenes are shown to exhibit efficient &lt;i&gt;E&#8594;Z&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization with red light (PSS&lt;sub&gt;660nm&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;75&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;) upon conjugation with unsaturated substituents. Initially demonstrated for aldehyde groups, this effect was also observed in a more complex structure by incorporating the chromophore into a cyclic dipeptide with propensity for self-assembly. Under physiological conditions, the latter molecule formed a supramolecular material that reversibly changed its viscosity upon irradiation with red light. Our observation can lead to design of new photopharmacology agents or phototriggered materials for in&#8197;vivo use.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isolation of an Antiaromatic 9&#8208;Hydroxy Fluorenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 31, Page 8105-8109, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly stable after all: Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenylacylium ion by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride, gave rise to a 4&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed via an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.







Abstract
Fluorenyl cations are textbook examples of 4&#960; electron antiaromatic five&#8208;membered ring systems. So far, they were reported only as short&#8208;lived intermediates generated under superacidic conditions or by flash photolysis. Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenyl acylium cation by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride gave rise to an isolable 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed by an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF6</title>

Become complex! The advanced one&#8208;step photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 allows the preparation of pentaflurosulfanylated oxepans, tetrahydropyrans and tetrahydrofurans as products with high structural complexity.







Abstract
Virtually inert sulfur hexafluoride becomes a precious pentafluorosulfanylation agent, if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, to access &#945;&#8208;fluoro and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy SF5&#8208;compounds. This advanced protocol converts SF6 in the presence of alkynols as bifunctional C&#8722;C&#8208; and C&#8722;O&#8208;bond forming reagents directly into pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step from &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenes. The proposed mechanism is supported by theoretical calculations and gives insights not only in the pentafluorosulfanylation step but also into formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond and is in full agreement with Baldwin's cyclization rules. The key step is a radical type 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; respectively 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;cyclization. The synthesized oxaheterocycles cannot be simply prepared by other synthetic methods, show a high level of structural complexity and significantly expand the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks valuable for medicinal and material chemistry.

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8211; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 31, Page 8082-8087, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free coupling of a tetrazine derivative and an enol ether group, the latter being covalently attached on a Si(001) surface via cyclooctyne, has been observed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. DFT calculations identified the associated reaction meachanism. This click chemistry scheme allows the synthesis of covalently bound molecular architectures on highly reactive surfaces in a UHV environment.







Abstract
The additive&#8208;free tetrazine/enol ether click reaction was performed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with an enol ether group covalently linked to a silicon surface: Dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate molecules were coupled to the enol ether group of a functionalized cyclooctyne which was adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. The reaction was observed at a substrate temperature of 380&#8197;K by means of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A moderate energy barrier was deduced for this click reaction in vacuum by means of density functional theory based calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results. This UHV&#8208;compatible click reaction thus opens a new, flexible route for synthesizing covalently bound organic architectures.

Exact UHPLC&#8208;MS2 quantifications were used to determine the oxidative lesion and epigenetically induced levels of the non&#8208;canonical bases hmdC, fdC and cadC and of the levels of base excision repair intermediates.







Abstract
The four non&#8208;canonical nucleotides in the human genome 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;carboxydeoxycytidine (mdC, hmdC, fdC and cadC) form a second layer of epigenetic information that contributes to the regulation of gene expression. Formation of the oxidized nucleotides hmdC, fdC and cadC requires oxidation of mdC by ten&#8208;eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes that require oxygen, Fe(II) and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate as cosubstrates. Although these oxidized forms of mdC are widespread in mammalian genomes, experimental evidence for their presence in fungi and plants is ambiguous. This vagueness is caused by the fact that these oxidized mdC derivatives are also formed as oxidative lesions, resulting in unclear basal levels that are likely to have no epigenetic function. Here, we report the xdC levels in the fungus Amanita muscaria in comparison to murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), HEK cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to obtain information about the basal levels of hmdC, fdC and cadC as DNA lesions in the genome.

&#8220;The preparation of novel hole transporting materials able to compete with the reference spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, has been a hot topic in photovoltaics in the last years. In the present paper, we have proposed a new design principle for the preparation of hole transporting materials for perovskite solar cells. Our approach relies on the functionalization of a clickable pillar[5]arene core with peripheral triarylamines to generate dendrimer&#8208;like structures.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;8110&#8197;ff.

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions  in vacuo  . We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in  D  3h  configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work&#8208;out distinct characteristics is often difficult.&#160; Here, we report that the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse input promises to fill this gap. &#160;Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts).&#160; The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;Tertiary&#8208;Butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(t  Bu2S)] (3) (TFA = trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5  , Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) (Di)azatricyclododecene Scaffold and its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel sp  3  carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. T ricyclic framework  6  was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one  9  via a gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor  11b&#8208;e  was the key to forming 6&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclized product  6  with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework  6  , a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  , which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold  7a  . C o mpounds  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z = Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy , and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound  20a  showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC  50  = 4.1 &#177; 0.8 &#956;M), whereas compounds  20a&#8208;g  showed antiviral activity with IC  50  values of 4.2&#8208;12.4 &#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Catalytic Activity for an Amphiphilic Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium Complex in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A switchable catalytic system is designed and constructed with host&#8208;guest interactions between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium (Py&#8208;Ru). Py&#8208;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibit an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD  +  to NADH. After forming inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8208;Ru aggregates are broke, leading to a decrease of catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered via competitive replacement of amantadine (AD). This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8208;guest interaction.</dc:description>

NHPI engaged MOFs: Two UiO metal&#8208;organic frameworks covalently merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide organocatalytic sites have been synthesized. Comprehensive studies on the MOF characteristics and optimal reaction condition and mechanism, show an unprecedented three&#8208;phase heterogeneous system has been established for catalytic oxidation of a wide scope of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds. The catalytic oxidation manifests high efficiency, excellent selectivity, requires mild conditions, and is environmentally friendly with molecular O2 as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Two highly efficient metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds under mild conditions. Based on the high efficiency and selectivity, an environmentally benign system with good sustainability, mild conditions, simple work&#8208;up procedure has been established for practical oxidation of a wide range of substrates.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides by Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrifying Sulfur! The electrolysis of organic disulfides in dichloromethane led to the formation of organic polysulfides with a high incorporation of additional sulfur atoms. HPLC/HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture could identify products up to undecasulfides. When CS2 was used as co&#8208;solvent the distribution of the organic polysulfide mixture was altered in favor of the lower polysulfides, such as tri&#8208; and tetrasulfides.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides through sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols is introduced. The highly economic, low&#8208;sensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;absorbance average sulfur amount in polysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide, and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative 13C NMR. Moreover, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and asymmetrical polysulfides could be obtained.

         <title>E4 Transfer (E=P, As) to Ni Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing the inaccessible: The use of the polypnictogen zirconium complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P, As) at ambient temperatures as phosphorus or arsenic sources to transfer E4&#8197;units to CpRNi fragments was examined. This avoids the difficulty of handling and toxicity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic. The transfer reactions gave access to a variety of polypnictogen transition metal complexes, among them unprecedented triple&#8208;decker&#8208;like compounds composed of cage entities as end&#8208;decks.







Abstract
The use of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (1&#8201;a), As (1&#8201;b), Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) as phosphorus or arsenic source, respectively, gives access to novel stable polypnictogen transition metal complexes at ambient temperatures. The reaction of 1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b with [CpRNiBr]2 (CpR=CpBn (1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentabenzyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl), Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; (1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)) was studied, to yield novel complexes depending on steric effects and stoichiometric ratios. Besides the transfer of the complete En unit, a degradation as well as aggregation can be observed. Thus, the prismane derivatives [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3:3&#8208;E4)] (2&#8201;a (E=P); 2&#8201;b (E=As)) or the arsenic containing cubane [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)3(&#956;3&#8208;As)(As4)] (5) are formed. Furthermore, the bromine bridged cubanes of the type [(CpRNi)3{Ni(&#956;&#8208;Br)}(&#956;3&#8208;E)4]2 (CpR=Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;: 6&#8201;a (E=P), 6&#8201;b (E=As), CpR=CpBn: 8&#8201;a (E=P), 8&#8201;b (E=As)) can be isolated. Here, a stepwise transfer of En units is possible, with a cyclo&#8208;E42&#8722; ligand being introduced and unprecedented triple&#8208;decker compounds of the type [{(CpRNi)3Ni(&#956;3&#8208;E)4}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;E&#8242;4)] (CpR=CpBn, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;; E/E&#8242;=P, As) are obtained.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Quenching in Iminophosphonamide Copper and Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To glow or not to glow: Chiral iminophosphonamide copper and zinc complexes are presented. Some steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) features studied at low temperatures can be described within the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) scheme. However, unusually, the fluorescence is nearly absent in two complexes and the low&#8208;lying triplet state quenches PL. Some excited states were further investigated by time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand&#8208;bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue&#8208;green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&lt;100&#8197;K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non&#8208;radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low&#8208;lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low&#8208;temperature time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of spongy bone, we synthesized 3D sponge&#8208;like porous carbons (SPCs) from CO2 in a home&#8208;made electrolytic cell equipped with low&#8208;temperature molten carbonate electrolyte. SPC4&#8208;0.5 shows excellent electrochemical capacitance performance due to its large&#8208;area meso&#8208;microporous structure, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity. Our research presents a simple, eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way towards production of functional carbon materials.







Abstract
Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO2 in molten carbonate Li2CO3&#8722;Na2CO3&#8722;K2CO3 at 580&#8201;&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO2 at 4&#8197;A for 0.5&#8197;h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9&#8201;%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to spare Tyr: The selective recognition of tyrosine residues by pseudopeptidic cages protects the substrates from Src kinase&#8208;promoted phosphorylation. The Tyr kinase&#8208;inhibiting activity of the cages can be satisfactorily explained by the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes. This supramolecular approach represents an appealing alternative to modulating Tyr kinase activity by substrate recognition.







Abstract
The selective recognition of tyrosine residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibiting their tyrosine kinase (TK)&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. Herein, we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. Fluorescence emission titrations show that the most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates with a very good correlation between the binding constant and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism of selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Redox&#8208;Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heat is on: A charge&#8208;transfer MOF based on redox&#8208;active TTF/NDI units has been prepared and structurally characterized. Due to the efficient charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the MOF shows excellent photothermal conversion performance. Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS composite films have been studied and could be new candidates for stable and processable materials in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, could have important applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, a new charge&#8208;transfer MOF (Co&#8208;MOF) with mixed ligands of H4TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating redox&#8208;active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system is reported. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. In addition, charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) results in a broad absorption in the NIR region. The Co&#8208;MOF exhibited an efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiation with a NIR laser. Under the 808&#8197;nm laser (0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) illumination, the temperature of the Co&#8208;MOF increased from room temperature to 201&#8201;&#176;C in only 10&#8197;s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amounts of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. When a Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) film is irradiated by 808&#8197;nm laser with power of 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it&#8242;s temperature can reach a plateau at 62&#8201;&#176;C from 20&#8201;&#176;C within 100&#8197;s. Our experimental results from the Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrate that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material is promising for photothermal applications.

DNA, Protein, RNA: The structure&#8208;based design of biomolecular conjugates composed of protein and DNA fragments that synergistically bind RNA via Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing and peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics were designed whereby two conjugates can simultaneously assemble on a single RNA scaffold. Through ternary complex formation, the peptide elements of each conjugate are drawn into close proximity, and this feature was exploited to enable an RNA&#8208;templated, double click reaction.







Abstract
Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates that bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.

         <title>Applying Unconventional Spectroscopies to the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets, Co(PPh3)2X2 (X=Cl, Br, I): Unveiling Magnetic Transitions and Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct determination of magnetic excited levels and spin&#8208;phonon couplings in the compounds in three SMMs, leading to magnetic relaxation, has been achieved by the combined use of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), far&#8208;IR magnetic spectroscopy (FIRMS), high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR, frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR, ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) analysis, and DFT calculations of phonons (i.&#8201;e., both molecular and lattice vibrations). Calculated spin densities on Co(II) ions correlate with magnetic separations in the compounds.







Abstract
Large separation of magnetic levels and slow relaxation in metal complexes are desirable properties of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Spin&#8208;phonon coupling (interactions of magnetic levels with phonons) is ubiquitous, leading to magnetic relaxation and loss of memory in SMMs and quantum coherence in qubits. Direct observation of magnetic transitions and spin&#8208;phonon coupling in molecules is challenging. We have found that far&#8208;IR magnetic spectra (FIRMS) of Co(PPh3)2X2 (Co&#8208;X; X=Cl, Br, I) reveal rarely observed spin&#8208;phonon coupling as avoided crossings between magnetic and u&#8208;symmetry phonon transitions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives phonon spectra. Calculations using VASP and phonopy programs gave phonon symmetries and movies. Magnetic transitions among zero&#8208;field split (ZFS) levels of the S=3/2 electronic ground state were probed by INS, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR), FIRMS, and frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR (FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR), giving magnetic excitation spectra and determining ZFS parameters (D, E) and g values. Ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) was used to analyze earlier electronic absorption spectra and give calculated ZFS parameters matching those from the experiments. DFT calculations also gave spin densities in Co&#8208;X, showing that the larger Co(II) spin density in a molecule, the larger its ZFS magnitude. The current work reveals dynamics of magnetic and phonon excitations in SMMs. Studies of such couplings in the future would help to understand how spin&#8208;phonon coupling may lead to magnetic relaxation and develop guidance to control such coupling.

     alt="Applying Unconventional Spectroscopies to the Single-Molecule Magnets, Co(PPh3)2X2 (X=Cl, Br, I): Unveiling Magnetic Transitions and Spin-Phonon Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct determination&lt;/b&gt; of magnetic excited levels and spin-phonon couplings in the compounds in three SMMs, leading to magnetic relaxation, has been achieved by the combined use of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), far-IR magnetic spectroscopy (FIRMS), high-frequency and -field EPR, frequency-domain FT terahertz EPR, ligand-field theory (LFT) analysis, and DFT calculations of phonons (i.&#8201;e., both molecular and lattice vibrations). Calculated spin densities on Co(II) ions correlate with magnetic separations in the compounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large separation of magnetic levels and slow relaxation in metal complexes are desirable properties of single-molecule magnets (SMMs). Spin-phonon coupling (interactions of magnetic levels with phonons) is ubiquitous, leading to magnetic relaxation and loss of memory in SMMs and quantum coherence in qubits. Direct observation of magnetic transitions and spin-phonon coupling in molecules is challenging. We have found that far-IR magnetic spectra (FIRMS) of Co(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Co-X&lt;/b&gt;; X=Cl, Br, I) reveal rarely observed spin-phonon coupling as avoided crossings between magnetic and &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;-symmetry phonon transitions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives phonon spectra. Calculations using VASP and phonopy programs gave phonon symmetries and movies. Magnetic transitions among zero-field split (ZFS) levels of the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=3/2 electronic ground state were probed by INS, high-frequency and -field EPR (HFEPR), FIRMS, and frequency-domain FT terahertz EPR (FD-FT THz-EPR), giving magnetic excitation spectra and determining ZFS parameters (&lt;i&gt;D, E&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; values. Ligand-field theory (LFT) was used to analyze earlier electronic absorption spectra and give calculated ZFS parameters matching those from the experiments. DFT calculations also gave spin densities in &lt;b&gt;Co-X&lt;/b&gt;, showing that the larger Co(II) spin density in a molecule, the larger its ZFS magnitude. The current work reveals dynamics of magnetic and phonon excitations in SMMs. Studies of such couplings in the future would help to understand how spin-phonon coupling may lead to magnetic relaxation and develop guidance to control such coupling.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flowers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple ex situ wet chemical transformation method of alkali treatment was proposed to prepare Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers with large specific surface areas from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The relationship between concentration of alkali and the structure properties of corresponding Ni(OH)2 was uncovered. As the results, the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 performed remarkably catalytic properties with lower potential, higher current density and excellent durability towards MOR among various samples.







Abstract
Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)2 with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)2 obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25&#8197;M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this ex situ conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 11C&#8208;Labelled Primary Benzamides via Intermediate [11C]Aroyl Dimethylaminopyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient method for radiolabeling of primary amides with the positron emitting radionuclide carbon&#8208;11 was developed. The method relies on intermediate electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, prepared via carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [11C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary [11C]benzamides, the current method paves the way for future application of [11C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in positron emission tomography (PET) tracer synthesis.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous TixOy  with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7 &#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure with UV light, the white TixOy  suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8208;O environment takes place upon to 350 &#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400 &#176;C is still not fully ordered.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Gold Chemistry: From Simple Salts to Complexes for Regioselective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The focusof this review is to highlight the advances in catalysis by gold complexes and salts on C&#8722;H bond activation chemistry. In particular, it covers the gold&#8208;catalyzed regioselective as well as site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization with emphasis on structural features, mechanisms and contributing factors of the relevant reactions. Depending on the nature of substrate, this review was categorized into six sections along with discussing applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R3P), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8722;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8722;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8722;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8722;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8722;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.

         <title>Rediscovering Sulfinylamines as Reagents for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent applications of N&#8208;sulfinylamines: In this Minireview, the use of N&#8208;sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O) in sulfoximine and sulfonimidamide synthesis, heterocycle formation and catalytic enantioselective oxidation of alkenes is covered. Brief discussions of their preparation, stability, properties and potential future applications are also included.







Abstract
Sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O), monoaza analogues of sulfur dioxide, have been known for well over a century, and their reactivity as sulfur electrophiles and in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is well&#8208;established. However, they have only rarely been used in organic synthesis in recent decades despite the increasing prominence of compounds containing N=S=O functionality, such as sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. This Minireview aims to bring wider visibility to the unique chemistry enabled by this class of compounds. We focus on advances from the last 10 years, including the first examples of their use in the one&#8208;pot syntheses of sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. Also covered are the reactions of sulfinylamines with carbon&#8208;centred radicals, their use for formation of heterocycles through cycloadditions, and catalytic enantioselective allylic oxidation of alkenes via a hetero&#8208;ene reaction. These examples highlight the different reactivity modes of sulfinylamines and their underappreciated potential for forming molecules which contain high&#8208; or low&#8208;valent sulfur, or even no sulfur at all.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Stoichiometric Synthesis of Mono&#8208;, Bi&#8208;, and Bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;Azaborinines: 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles as Reactive Precursors</title>

         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen analogs of metallacyclopentadienes in the form of 1&#8208;rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles (see Figure) are shown to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. Comparisons with 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes demonstrate their superior reactivity towards alkynes, allowing to expand the range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. A series of multiply substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged derivative and rare bicyclic derivatives composed of two 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings linked by a single bond, are reported.







Abstract
A series of highly substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine, was synthesized from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes with variously substituted alkynes. 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaborole complexes, which are accessible by phosphine addition to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes, were also found to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines and readily reacted with alkynyl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines to generate new regioisomers of bi&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines, which feature directly connected aromatic rings. Their molecular structures, which can be viewed as boron&#8208;nitrogen isosteres of biphenyls, show nearly perpendicular 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings. The new method using rhodacycles instead of 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes as precursors is shown to be more effective, allowing the synthesis of a wider range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines.

         <title>Design, synthesis, and biochemical evaluation of alpha&#8208;amanitin derivatives containing analogs of the trans&#8208;hydroxyproline residue for potential use in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates</title>

         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;amanitin, an extremely toxic bicyclic octapeptide extracted from the death&#8208;cap mushroom,  Amanita phalloides,  is a highly selective allosteric inhibitor of RNA polymerase II.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tunable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. Accordingly, we designed a series of substituted phosphate linkers for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1 day to 2 hours or 5 minutes, as shown for linkers containing  p  &#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing  p  &#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4 days, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, respectively) than their  p  &#8208;fluoro analogues. The  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25 minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through&#160;Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from  cis  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;  l  &#8208;alanine (  cis  &#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on  C  &#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the  cis  &#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into  trans  &#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taking advantage of ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution to design nine&#8208;membered P,O,Si&#8208;heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds have been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic studies on host&#8208;guest systems based on cucurbit[8]uril and dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches shows that the more tightly bound closed DTE isomers are kinetically more stable that their open counterparts. This allows for the modulation of their binding dynamics with light stimulus constituting an attractive tool for the development of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular systems.







Abstract
The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work, a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches is reported. It is shown that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. Moreover, the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is demonstrated to be approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t1/2=107&#8197;h vs. t1/2=1.2&#8197;h for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.

         <title>Multifunctional Heterometallic IrIII&#8722;AuI Probes as Promising Anticancer and Antiangiogenic Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden opportunity: Cytotoxic and green&#8208;emissive orthometallated IrIII&#8208;AuI complexes have been synthesised. For some of the complexes, trafficking between the lysosomes and mitochondria in A549 cells can be suggested. Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential was observed as well as an apoptotic cell death mechanism. Angiogenic assays reveal that the complexes have good prospects as antimetastatic agents.







Abstract
A new class of emissive cyclometallated IrIII&#8722;AuI complexes with a bis(diphenylphosphino) methanide bridging ligand was successfully synthesised from the diphosphino complex [Ir(N^C)2(dppm)]+ (1). The different gold ancillary ligand, a triphenylphosphine (2), a chloride (3) or a thiocytosine (4) did not reveal any significant effect on the photophysical properties, which are mainly due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) transitions based on IrIII. However, the AuI fragment, along with the ancillary ligand, seemed crucial for the bioactivity in A549 lung carcinoma cells versus endothelial cells. Both cell types display variable sensitivities to the complexes (IC50=0.6&#8211;3.5&#8197;&#956;M). The apoptotic pathway is activated in all cases, and paraptotic cell death seems to take place at initial stages in A549 cells. Species 2&#8211;4 showed at least dual lysosomal and mitochondrial biodistribution in A549 cells, with an initial lysosomal localisation and a possible trafficking process between both organelles with time. The bimetallic IrIII&#8722;AuI complexes disrupted the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in A549 cells and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition in comparison with that displayed by the monometallic complex 1. Angiogenic activity assays performed in endothelial cells revealed the promising antimetastatic potential of 1, 2 and 4.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Phytoprostanes with Prostaglandin&#8208;Like Configuration, Evidence for Their Formation in Edible Vegetable Oils and Orienting Study of Their Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PhytoP against PhytoG: The first total synthesis of phytoglandins (PhytoG), phytoprostanes (PhytoP) with prostaglandin configuration was accomplished. They are indeed metabolites of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid and form at sizeable levels during aging of edible vegetable oils as demonstrated in a UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study.







Abstract
Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF1&#945; (9&#8208;epi&#8208;16&#8208;F1t&#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer ent&#8208;16&#8208;epi&#8208;PhytoGF1&#945; (ent&#8208;9,16&#8208;diepi&#8208;16&#8208;F1t&#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F1&#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F2t&#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF2&#945; (FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.

         <title>Advanced Acceptor&#8208;Substituted S,N&#8208;Heteropentacenes for Application in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized S,N&#8208;heteropentacenes SN5&#8217; comprising annulated thiophene and pyrrole rings with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were developed with systematically varied structural motifs. Tunable frontier orbital energies allowed their application either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells.







Abstract
Ambifunctional heterpentacenes with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were used either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells. Different acceptor moieties and side chains were inserted. Synthesis and characterization of the systematically varied structural motifs provided insight in structure&#8208;property relationships. Moreover, a dimeric heteroacene was synthesized, and the optoelectronic properties were compared to those of its monomeric counterpart.

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy. Supporting Electrolytes are not Always Inert</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the influence of the electrolyte pH, presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline Au electrodes have been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift of the PME. These findings reveal that e.g. K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond that, the knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Aza&#8208;Crown Ether Complexes as Biomimetics for Lanthanide and Calcium Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) based model system was used for the investigation of different factors that may have an impact on the oxidation reaction in the active sites of alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. Using various metal salts, the influence of ion size and charge, as well as counterions was investigated. The study involves NMR and EPR analysis as well as advanced mass spectrometry techniques.







Abstract
Understanding the role of metal ions in biology can lead to the development of new catalysts for several industrially important transformations. Lanthanides are the most recent group of metal ions that have been shown to be important in biology, that is, in quinone&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Here we evaluate a literature&#8208;known pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and 1&#8208;aza&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 based ligand platform as scaffold for Ca2+, Ba2+, La3+ and Lu3+ biomimetics of MDH and we evaluate the importance of ligand design, charge, size, counterions and base for the alcohol oxidation reaction using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we report a new straightforward synthetic route (3 steps instead of 11 and 33&#8201;% instead of 0.6&#8201;% yield) for biomimetic ligands based on PQQ. We show that when studying biomimetics for MDH, larger metal ions and those with lower charge in this case promote the dehydrogenation reaction more effectively and that this is likely an effect of the ligand design which must be considered when studying biomimetics. To gain more information on the structures and impact of counterions of the complexes, we performed collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments and observe that the nitrates are more tightly bound than the triflates. To resolve the structure of the complexes in the gas phase we combined DFT&#8208;calculations and ion mobility measurements (IMS). Furthermore, we characterized the obtained complexes and reaction mixtures using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and show the presence of a small amount of quinone&#8208;based radical.

         <title>Fe(II) metallohelices stabilize DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes and down&#8208;regulate expression of G&#8208;quadruplex regulated oncogenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, we employed methods of molecular biophysics and biology to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (  hTelo  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit1  ,  c&#8208;kit2  ) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (  hTelo  ) and in the promoter regions of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible optically pure metallohelices made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe(II) ions, which exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity towards duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of metallohelix containing  m  &#8208;xylenyl bridge (  5b  ) were found to be effective inhibitors of primer elongation catalyzed by  Taq  DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing  c&#8208;myc  and  c&#8208;kit2  G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of  5b  down&#8208;regulated the expression of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multi&#8208;targeted drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles by Amination with Anilines</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct and efficient asymmetric synthesis of phenylamino&#8208;3&#8208;indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones was realized by developing a chiral nickel complex catalytic system for the amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines. A wide range of 3&#8208;aminooxindoles with 3&#8208;alkyl or 3&#8208;aryl substitution, including key intermediates of bioactive molecules, was created in excellent yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;nickel(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines has been developed. A series of alkyl or aryl 3&#8208;amino&#8208;indolinones with quaternary stereocenters were obtained in high yields with excellent ee values in one step (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 96&#8201;% ee). The method provided a ready route to optically active intermediates of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;based bioactive compounds. Moreover, a possible transition&#8208;state model is proposed so as to elucidate the origin of the chirality based on the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the catalyst and the adduct.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In theory and in practice: A three&#8208;component reaction of amine, difluorocarbene, and CO2 to form an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine core was predicted by the artificial force&#8208;induced reaction method and successfully demonstrated in experiment with a broad range of tert&#8208;amines and heteroaromatic compounds. Moreover, the products can be used for the generation of difluorocarbene without any additives, difluoroalkylation under photoredox conditions, and synthesis of metal&#8208;NHC complexes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved by using amines, difluorocarbene (generated in&#8197;situ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and nontoxic C1 source CO2. Various tert&#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification by column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained from computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, as strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0&#8201;&#176;C without any additives was discovered. Finally, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature H2 Reduction of Copper Oxide Subnanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper oxide subnanoparticles with sizes of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, which were prepared using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, exhibit the lowest CuII&#8594;CuI reduction temperature directly observed by in situ XAFS measurements during temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (TPR) with H2. The CuO particles with low atomicity easily release oxygen atoms because of their surface&#8208;strained structure and the unprecedented elongation of their Cu&#8722;O bonds. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Tanabe, K. Yamamoto et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100508).

         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoretentive N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with cyclohexanones as halogen&#8208;free aryl sources was performed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, comprising a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acid products without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products. This method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity for at least 3&#8197;days.







Abstract
The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. A versatile synthetic method was developed to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.&#8201;e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and turnover frequency (5.9&#8197;h&#8722;1) for at least 3&#8197;days.

         <title>Activation of a Copper Biscarbene Mechano&#8208;Catalyst Using Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy Supported by Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy was used to activate a copper biscarbene (NHC) mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials. By using a safety line, bypassing the mechanophore, we were able to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces of the Cu&#8722;NHC bond to range from 1.6 to 2.6&#8197;nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;H.&#8197;Binder, M.&#8197;K.&#8197;Beyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Take your Positions and Shine: Effects of Positioning Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores within Sequence&#8208;Defined Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamines) are employed to develop supramolecular ligands with AIE properties for detection of binding. Special focus is devoted to varying the position of the AIE luminophore within the scaffold and in relation to the supramolecular binding motif. A strong influence of the position on the resulting AIE properties is shown and evaluated for the ligand binding to various natural and synthetic polyanions.







Abstract
A luminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is employed for the conjugation onto supramolecular ligands to allow for detection of ligand binding. Supramolecular ligands are based on the combination of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine) scaffolds and guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (GCP) as binding motif. We hypothesize that AIE properties are strongly affected by positioning of the luminophore within the ligand scaffold. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effects placing the AIE luminophore at different positions within the overall construct, for example, in the main or side chain of the olig(amidoamine). Indeed, we can show that the position within the ligand structure strongly affects AIE, both for the ligand itself as well as when applying the ligand for the detection of different biological and synthetic polyanions.

         <title>Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large amount of Fe2+ was induced into Mn3O4 nanoparticles through effective electrodisplacement reaction to synthesize Mn3&#8722;xFeXO4 hollow nanostructures. By changing the addition of Fe2+, elemental compositions and structures of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 could be well adjusted. The remarkable performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures in pseudocapacitor applications is demonstrated. Compared with the original Mn3O4, the electrochemical performance of the obtained porous Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 nanostructure is significantly improved.







Abstract
Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructure substantially enhanced comparing with pristine Mn3O4. Particularly, in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 with a typical diameter of 20&#8197;nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 0.75&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.

         <title>A Rapid and Mild Sulfation Strategy Reveals Conformational Preferences in Therapeutically Relevant Sulfated Xylooligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers reported to date is facilitated by a rapid and quantitative one&#8208;pot sulfation protocol based on the in&#8197;situ generation of SO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF. The synthesized oligosaccharide standards afforded unique structural insights into persulfated xylooligomers, including a 1C4 conformational preference for all associated non&#8208;reducing pyranosyl residues. Application of the method to the synthesis of a sulfated pyridyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;xylotriose also enabled identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a commercial sample of pentosan polysulfate, a widely&#8208;deployed sulfated xylooligosaccharide&#8208;based therapy.







Abstract
Although sulfated xylooligosaccharides are promising therapeutic leads for a multitude of afflictions, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of commercially deployed forms (e.&#8201;g. Pentosan polysulfate 1) complicates their path to further clinical development. We describe herein the synthesis of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers prepared to date, comprising up to eight xylose residues, as standards for biological studies. Near quantitative sulfation was accomplished using a remarkably mild and operationally simple protocol which avoids the need for high temperatures and a large excess of the sulfating reagent. Moreover, the sulfated xylooligomer standards so obtained enabled definitive identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a sample of a commercially prepared Pentosan drug and provided significant insights into the conformational preferences of the constituent persulfated monosaccharide residues. As the spatial distribution of sulfates is a key determinant of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides to endogenous targets, these findings have broad implications for the advancement of Pentosan&#8208;based treatments.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;Coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An actinide polyrotaxane compound URCP1 with characteristic green fluorescence from uranyl centers was prepared through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in URCP1 has increased freedom and structural flexibility, and displays intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered dynamic conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6]. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Mei et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100614).

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium alkoxide with a pinch of salt: The in&#8197;situ release of organic or inorganic anions from silyl compounds allows for their encapsulation in a sodium alkoxide shell. These spherical mixed aggregates incorporate anions ranging from the organic and basic methyl anion, halides, and pseudo&#8208;halides to the nitrate anion. In this form, such anions can be studied as isolated entities unaffected by the influence of strongly coordinating solvents.







Abstract
Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et&#8197;al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert&#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert&#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.

         <title>Coexistence of Two Different Distorted Octahedral [MnF6]3&#8722; Sites in K3[MnF6]: Manifestation in Spectroscopy and Magnetism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distorted octahedra: Using a high&#8208;temperature/high&#8208;pressure synthesis, K3[MnF6] with two different kinds of distorted [MnF6]3&#8722; octahedra &#8211; a pseudo&#8208;rhombic and an pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated distorted octahedron &#8211; was structurally, magnetically and spectroscopically characterized. A theoretical interpretation of the electronic structure and molecular geometry is given.







Abstract
As a consequence of the static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect of the 5E ground state of MnIII in cubic structures with octahedral parent geometries, their octahedral coordination spheres become distorted. In the case of six fluorido ligands, [MnF6]3&#8722; anions with two longer and four shorter Mn&#8722;F bonds making elongated octahedra are usually observed. Herein, we report the synthesis of the compound K3[MnF6] through a high&#8208;temperature approach and its crystallization by a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature route. The main structural motifs are two quasi&#8208;isolated, octahedron&#8208;like [MnF6]3&#8722; anions of quite different nature compared to that met in ideal octahedral MnIII Jahn&#8208;Teller systems. Owing to the internal electric field of Ci symmetry dominated by the next&#8208;neighbour K+ ions acting on the MnIII sites, both sites, the pseudo&#8208;rhombic (site 1) and the pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated (site 2) [MnF6]3&#8722; anions are present in K3[MnF6]. The compound was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and magnetometry as well as by FTIR, Raman, and ligand field spectroscopy. A theoretical interpretation of the electronic structure and molecular geometry of the two Mn sites in the lattice is given by using a vibronic coupling model with parameters adjusted from multireference ab&#8208;initio cluster calculations.

         <title>Saccharified Uranyl Ions: Self&#8208;Assembly of UO22+ into Trinuclear Anionic Complexes by the Coordination of Glucosamine&#8208;Derived Schiff Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saccharify your uranyl ions! The cover art shows a cotton candy machine at a country fair. By feeding uranyl ions and a sugar&#8208;based ligand into it, a trinuclear uranyl complex is formed, illustrated as cotton candy. The complex shows the coordination motive of three uranyl ions in the core, bridged by a central &#956;3&#8208;oxo ligand, surrounded by the three sugar ligands. This work presents spectroscopic investigations into the complex formation and its self&#8208;assembly. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Weigand et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted in Live Cells Based on Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;cell Affinity of G&#8208;quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA computation is considered as one fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers, which has evoked substantial attention and gained rapid advancements. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially in cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, we designed a series of DNA logic gates by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further utilizing the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, we have achieved in realizing an  INHIBIT  logic gate whose operational site is precisely restricted in specific live cells. The design strategy may have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Au&#8208;Catalyzed Enynamide&#8208;yne Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the pattern: The Au&#8208;catalyzed formal dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of enynamide&#8208;yne derivatives was shown experimentally and computationally to proceed according to a dual gold&#8208;catalyzed mechanism. The reaction proceeded in 3 stages: initial formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex followed by cyclization to produce a gem&#8208;diaurated aryl complex and finally a catalyst transfer. The concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event was found to depend on the substitution pattern of the ynamide moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allow efficient access to a variety of N&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8722;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In this article, complete experimental and computational investigations into the mechanism of such a transformation are reported. Support for a dual gold catalysis was found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in three stages: 1)&#8197;formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2)&#8197;cyclization to produce a gem&#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3)&#8197;catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Following the pattern&lt;/b&gt;: The Au-catalyzed formal dehydro-Diels-Alder reaction of enynamide-yne derivatives was shown experimentally and computationally to proceed according to a dual gold-catalyzed mechanism. The reaction proceeded in 3 stages: initial formation of a &#963;,&#960;-digold complex followed by cyclization to produce a &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diaurated aryl complex and finally a catalyst transfer. The concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event was found to depend on the substitution pattern of the ynamide moiety.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold-catalyzed dehydro-Diels-Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allow efficient access to a variety of N-containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8722;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In this article, complete experimental and computational investigations into the mechanism of such a transformation are reported. Support for a dual gold catalysis was found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in three stages: 1)&#8197;formation of a &#963;,&#960;-digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2)&#8197;cyclization to produce a &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diaurated aryl complex, and 3)&#8197;catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;-digold complex.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Elucidating the Dual Mode of Action of Dipeptidyl Enoates in the Inhibition of Rhodesain Cysteine Proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A QM/MM computational study of two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8722;CO2C2H5 confirms the dual mode of action of this family of inhibitors. Efforts focused on increasing the interaction with the residues of the S2 pocket of rhodesain could be used as a guide to design new dual inhibitors with greater selectivity and affinity.







Abstract
A computational study of the two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8722;CO2C2H5 has been carried out by means of molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid QM/MM potentials. The low free energy barriers confirm that the Cys25 residue can attack both C&#946; and C1 atoms of the inhibitor, confirming a dual mode of action in the inhibition of the rhodesain by enoates. According to the results, the inhibition process through the Cys25 attack on the C&#946; atom of the inhibitor is an exergonic and irreversible process, while the inhibition process when Cys25 attacks on the C1 atom of the inhibitor is and exergonic but reversible process. The interactions between the inhibitor and rhodesain suggest that P2 is the most important fragment to consider in the design of new efficient inhibitors of rhodesain. These results may be useful for the design of new inhibitors of rhodesain and other related cysteine proteases based on dipeptidyl enoates scaffolds.

         <title>Quantification and Prediction of Imine Formation Kinetics in Aqueous Solution by Microfluidic NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imine formation in aqueous solution that was finished within several minutes by microfluidic NMR spectroscopy was investigated. The forward rate constants k+ were quantified by an empirical equation containing three independent parameters: reactivity parameters of aldehydes (SE, E) and amines (N). These results allow the prediction of the unknown forward rate constant k+ and rational design of two reaction networks exhibiting kinetic selectivity.







Abstract
Quantitatively predicting the reactivity of dynamic covalent reaction is essential to understand and rationally design complex structures and reaction networks. Herein, the reactivity of aldehydes and amines in various rapid imine formation in aqueous solution by microfluidic NMR spectroscopy was quantified. Investigation of reaction kinetics allowed to quantify the forward rate constants k+ by an empirical equation, of which three independent parameters were introduced as reactivity parameters of aldehydes (SE, E) and amines (N). Furthermore, these reactivity parameters were successfully used to predict the unknown forward rate constants of imine formation. Finally, two competitive reaction networks were rationally designed based on the proposed reactivity parameters. Our work has demonstrated the capability of microfluidic NMR spectroscopy in quantifying the kinetics of label&#8208;free chemical reactions, especially rapid reactions that are complete in minutes.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalative Platinum Anticancer Complexes Photoactivated by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green to go: Photoactive all&#8208;trans diazido PtIV complexes with an axial 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide ligand that can pre&#8208;intercalate into DNA have been synthesised. They can be photoactivated with visible light to generate PtII DNA interstrand crosslinks and cytotoxic ROS, and are thus promising photo&#8208;chemotherapeutic agents. Notably, a 4&#8208;NMe2 substituent red&#8208;shifted absorption of the naphthalimide ring, giving rise to its green&#8208;light photo&#8208;cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Photoactivatable agents offer the prospect of highly selective cancer therapy with low side effects and novel mechanisms of action that can combat current drug resistance. 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides with their extended &#960; system can behave as light&#8208;harvesting groups, fluorescent probes and DNA intercalators. We conjugated N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (gly&#8208;R&#8208;Nap) with an R substituent on the naphthyl group to photoactive diazido PtIV complexes to form t,t,t&#8208;[Pt(py)2(N3)2(OH)(gly&#8208;R&#8208;Nap)], R=H (1), 3&#8208;NO2 (2) or 4&#8208;NMe2 (3). They show enhanced photo&#8208;oxidation, cellular accumulation and promising photo&#8208;cytotoxicity in human A2780 ovarian, A549 lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells with visible light activation, and low dark cytotoxicity. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit pre&#8208;intercalation into DNA, resulting in enhanced photo&#8208;induced DNA crosslinking. Complex 3 has a red&#8208;shifted absorption band at 450&#8197;nm, allowing photoactivation and photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with green light.

A challenging synthesis yields a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer precursor complex that may be oxidized to a remarkably redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation which shows significant cytotoxicity towards a breast cancer cell line. Electrophoresis, viscometry, and spectroscopic data suggest the likely mode of interaction of the compound with DNA involves partial intercalation, enabling it to potentially target both conventional and unconventional DNA species such as three&#8208;way junctions (in silico data).

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tuneable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are formed by [4+6] dynamic imine condensation in solution. These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming essentially organic cage alloys mixing fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks, depicted as golden honeycomb&#8208;like structure. More information can be found in the Communication by B.&#8197;M. Schmidt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100891).

         <title>TIPS&#8208;Ethynylated Naphthodiquinoline and Naphthodiacridine: Novel Diazabisacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gluing together two monoazaacenes: The synthesis of two novel diazabisacenes with cata&#8208;annelated monoazaacene subunits sharing three joint bonds is reported. These &#8220;&#960;&#8208;extended pyrenes&#8221; exhibit global aromaticity with bond length alternations and optical spectra similar to acenes, thus justifying the term &#8220;bisacenes&#8221; for the compounds investigated. Introducing nitrogen into the bisacene backbone significantly increases stability compared to that of their hydrocarbon analogs.







Abstract
The synthesis of two diazabisacenes is reported. A bisboronated naphthalene was Suzuki&#8208;coupled to substituted ethyl nicotinates, then cyclized by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. The resulting diketones were alkynylated and reduced to give the title compounds, bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituted naphtha[1,8&#8208;gh:5,4&#8208;g&#8242;h&#8242;]diquinoline and naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc:5,4&#8208;b&#8242;c&#8242;]diacridine. Nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the bisacenes with respect to oxidation compared to their consanguine nonaza analogs.

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient radical cations, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of enol silyl ethers by the excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst, can be exploited as Br&#248;nsted acids for the activation of cyanopyridines. The protonation allows facile single&#8208;electron reduction of the cyanopyridinium to generate radical intermediates and concomitantly converts the radical cations into nucleophilic allylic radicals to be engaged in the radical&#8208;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers.







Abstract
Intermediary radical cations, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of enol silyl ethers by excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalysts, can be exploited as Br&#248;nsted acids for the activation of heteroarylcyanides. This strategy enables the direct allylic C&#8722;H heteroarylation of enol silyl ethers under visible&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100 K were subject to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average from two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and its Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The work reports&#160;single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin&#8208;film state by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization between the triarylamine sub&#8208;chromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) form the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donor, triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration amongst the TPA core and the other donors renders the poor &#960;&#8208;conjugation in the entire chromophore, thereby the individual sub&#8208;chromophoric units still retain their individual emission characteristics which cover all the three primary color emissions. TPA&#8208;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originated from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in a lifetime, exerts linear relationship against temperature between 180 &#8211; 330 K, thereby functioning as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19 K&#8208;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with the spectral shift of 0.3 nm K&#8722;1 and its workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Saddle&#8208;shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSM.</dc:description>

         <title>Unbalanced 2D Chiral Crystallization of Pentahelicene Propellers and Their Planarization into Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiral self&#8208;assembly of trispentahelicene propellers on a gold surface has been investigated in ultrahigh vacuum by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The trispentahelicene propellers aggregate into mirror domains with an enantiomeric ratio of 2:1. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation leads to planarization into nanographenes, which self&#8208;assemble into closed&#8208;packed layers with two different azimuths. Further treatment induces in part dimerization and trimerization by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted meta&#8208;Halophenols by Anion&#8208;Accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclic Ring&#8208;Opening</title>

         <dc:description>Disrotatory &#8208; thermally allowed &#8208; 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature, to give their corresponding  meta  &#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8208;92% yield, average 65%). Many of the phenols hold unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was featured by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated by an ab initio study, which concluded that base mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the  meta  &#8208;halophenol.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Non&#8208;aqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, in comparison to RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high voltage non&#8208;aqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of trace oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes, mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, we propose diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in non&#8208;aqueous organic RFB. We demonstrate organic RFBs utilizing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) (1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino) anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;Di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis (2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of redox pairs. Symmetric flow cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic non&#8208;aqueous RFBs</dc:description>

For a  d  2  electron configuration of the N&#8801;MF3  compounds in  C  3v  symmetry Hund's rule predict a high&#8208;spin  3  A  2  ground state with two parallel spin electrons and two degenerate metal  d  (&#948;)&#8208;orbitals.

         <title>Decoding directing groups and their pivotal role in C&#8211;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8211;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways  via  which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8211;H activation.&#160;Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8211;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8211;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues.&#160;Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8211;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level.&#160;A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Aurophilic Interactions in Multi&#8208;Radical Species: Electronic&#8208;Spin and Redox Properties of Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;[(Nitronyl Nitroxide)&#8208;Gold(I)] Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Ligand Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>We synthesized multinuclear&#8208;Au(I) complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anion and phosphine&#8208;ligand scaffolds, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1m, and (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1p, to investigate the influence of Au(I)&#8208;Au(I) (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multi&#8208;spin molecular systems. The desired complexes were successfully prepared in moderate yields using a one&#8208;pot synthetic method from the corresponding phosphine ligand, Au(I) source, and parent NN, and sodium hydroxide. Among these prepared complexes, compound (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o, where an aurophilic interaction was clearly observed by crystal structure analysis, showed characteristic spin&#8208;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and solvatochromic behavior. Results from theoretical calculations also suggested that the differences in their properties between complex (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o and the other complexes are due to intramolecular aurophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Photo&#8208;Ion Probing of the Ring&#8208;Opening Process in Trans&#8208;Stilbene Oxide.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photo&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening process of the oxirane derivative trans&#8208;stilbene oxide through the use of ultrafast UV/UV pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy utilizing photoion detection. We identify the single&#8208; and multiphoton probe paths and final states through comparisons between UV power studies and synchrotron&#8208;based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single&#8208;photon ionization studies.&#160; We observe three major time&#8208;dependent features of the parent ion (sub&#8208;450 fs decay, (1.5 &#177; 0.2) ps, and &gt; 100 ps). We discuss these decays in conjunction to the primary ring&#8208;opening mechanism of stilbene oxide that occurs  via  C&#8211;C dissociation in the oxirane ring. We also investigate the appearance of fragments relating to the masses of dehydrogenated diphenylmethane (167 amu) and dehydrogenated methylbenzene (90 amu). The appearance of the 167 amu fragment may suggest an alternative ultrafast ring&#8208;opening pathway  via  the dissociation of one of the C&#8211;O bonds within the oxirane ring</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to Carbene&#8208;M&#8208;Amido (M = Cu, Ag, Au) Complexes for Luminescence and Photocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all operations to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8208;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO66 decorated MWCNT) as Nanofiller in MMMs for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. Amine functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH  2  &#8208;MWCNT) holding exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was cross&#8208;linked with amine functionalized 3D MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  ) with high CO  2  affinity through Schiff base&#160;reaction. The resultant cross&#8208;linked mixed dimensional nanostructure was used as nanofiller into polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on gas separation performances of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping micrographs revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO66@MWCNT into the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0 wt.% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to 4.2 Barrer of pristine PSf membrane for pure CO  2  . Moreover, the selectivity (CO  2  /CH  4  ) of the same MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from 28.0 observed for pristine PSf&#160;under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capability for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have made them now indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Also, their utilization in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted due to broad&#8208;spread interest. Here we give an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and its Two&#8208;sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for its possibility for new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. Herein, we show that a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is the first example for forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the  Ia  3  d  phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350 K), a metastable  Ia  3  d  phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100 days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogs were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analog of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (  2  ,  3  ), pivaloyl (  4  ), triflyl (  5  ) and also phosphinite (  6  ) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using  4  and  5  in transition metal catalyzed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (  8  &#8208;  11  ) and tetraalkynyl (  7  ) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesized via direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). The high surface area of 424 m  2  /g was achieved which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA render the broad visible light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was utilized to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99 % conversion. Furthermore, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8208;14). The versatility and flexibility in the current material design is beneficial for understanding the offered photo&#8208;activity and surface basicity to design dual active (photo) catalyst materials for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: an Easy Entry to &#945;&#8722;substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles.</title>

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes was developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes have been selectively converted into amines or nitriles. Furthermore, when chiral &#946;&#8208;substituted nitro compounds were reacted, the stereochemical integrity of the stereocenter was maintained and &#945;&#8722;functionalized nitriles were obtained with no loss in enantiomeric excess. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, and TBS&#8208;protected cyanohydrins, including direct precursors of four APIs (Ibuprofen, Tembamide, Aegeline and Denopamine).</dc:description>

         <title>An NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene for catalytic formylation: A DFT guided approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds in the field of catalysis is gaining momentum. NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes owing to the access of two lone pairs of electrons have been found as excellent Lewis bases, however, they are yet to be&#160; used as catalysts.&#160; Herein, we report an NHC stabilized phosphinidene 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (  1  ) for&#160; the activation of CO  2  . A closer inspection on the CO  2  activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis unravel that phosphinidene associates with phenylsilane through a non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8208;H facilitating its transfer to the CO  2  molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO  2  activation and its catalytic reductive functionalization leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

NHC-stabilized phosphinidenes owing to the access of two lone pairs of electrons have been found as excellent Lewis bases, however, they are yet to be&#160; used as catalysts.&#160; Herein, we report an NHC stabilized phosphinidene 1,3-dimethyl-2-(phenylphosphanylidene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazole (  1  ) for&#160; the activation of CO  2  . A closer inspection on the CO  2  activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis unravel that phosphinidene associates with phenylsilane through a non-covalent &#960;-&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si-H facilitating its transfer to the CO  2  molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO  2  activation and its catalytic reductive functionalization leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;size and Edge/Defect&#8208;rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we utilized a facile aqueous synthesis strategy (finished in 5 min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomesh without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomesh possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores exhibited in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomesh disclosed that they undergo the oriented attachment growth along &lt;111&gt; direction. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomesh with certain elemental ratio (e.g., Pd  87  Cu  13  ) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processing of Topochemically Converted Layered WO3 for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique to utilize in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others due to lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE has been carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in twenty&#8208;two different solvents, and among studied solvents isopropyl alcohol&#8208;water (1:1) co&#8208;solvent system appears to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low boiling point solvent enable to fabricate thin films with varying thickness using spray deposition method. The obtained thin films are used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7 mF cm&#8208;2 at 5 mV s&#8208;1. The photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent.

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the  para  &#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal center without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomer is also very high.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength Te&#8230;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the&#160;&#955;4 Te&#160;dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8230;O ChB distances are 2.062&#160;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8208;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger.

Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8230;O ChB distances are 2.062&#160;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT-D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2:2 heterotetramer with alternating&#160;&#955;4 Te and&#160;&#955;2 Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu2&#8211;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu  2&#8211;  x  S, their combination at the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral range. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing property translates to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, rendering them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, we present the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites, with focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8722;shell, reverse core&#8722;shell, and yolk&#8722;shell configurations. We also discuss the photothermal behavior of these materials and provide a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional materials for their adjustable structures and diverse functions. They have potentials applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance was also rarely investigated. Herein, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;4.5H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;4EtOH&#183;13H2O (2) and [Zn2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;2H2O (3), have been synthesized. Further, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8208;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to gain composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3 mAh g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show the discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1 A g&#8722;1 over 100 runs, respectively. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329 mAh g&#8722;1 were still maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at the large current density (1 A g&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the  P  /  M  bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This in turn enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Halogen Bonding and Chalcogen Bonding Chloride Transporters with Non&#8208;Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic anion transporters show much promise as potential anti&#8208;cancer agents and therapeutics for diseases associated with mis&#8208;regulation of protein anion channels. In such applications high activity and anion selectivity are crucial to overcome competing proton or hydroxide transport which dissipates cellular pH gradients. Here we report highly active bidentate halogen bonding and chalcogen bonding anion carriers based on electron deficient iodo&#8208; and telluromethyl&#8208;triazole derivatives. Anion transport experiments in lipid bilayer vesicles reveal record nanomolar chloride transport activity for the bidentate halogen bonding anion carrier, and remarkably high chloride over proton/hydroxide selectivity for the chalcogen bonding anionophore. Computational studies provide further insight into the role of sigma&#8208;hole mediated anion recognition and desolvation at the membrane interface. Comparison with hydrogen bonding analogues demonstrates the importance of employing sigma&#8208;hole donor motifs in synthetic anionophores for achieving both high transport activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomeric and Enantiomeric 2&#8217;&#8208;Deoxycytidines: Base Pair Stability in the Absence and Presence of Silver Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>12&#8208;mer duplex DNA containing anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;D) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;L/&#946;&#8208;D) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mismatches was studied with respect to base pair stability in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with silver&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8208;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. Stability changes were observed depending on the composition of the mismatches. Most strikingly, the new silver&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;dC with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;L&#8208;dC is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;dC pair in view of stability. CD spectra were used to follow global helical changes of DNA structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8208; (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>

         <dc:description>Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8208;  posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8208;  with X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2  as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors. Temperature&#8208;dependent formation of [B12X11NG]&#8208;  indicate the enthalpy order (X&#160;=&#160;CN)&#160;&gt;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;Cl) &#8776;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;Br)&#160;&gt;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;I) &#8776;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;F) almost independent of the NG in good agreement with calculated trends. The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11  ]&#8208;  and steric effects. The binding of CO and N2  to [B12X11  ]&#8208;  is significantly stronger. The B3LYP 0K attachment enthapies follow the order (X=F) &gt;&#160;(X=CN) &gt; (X=Cl) &gt; (X=Br) &gt; (X=I), in contrats to the NG series. The bonding motifs of [B12X11CO]&#8208;  and [B12X11N2  ]&#8208;  were characterized using cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy by focusing on the CO and N2  stretching frequencies &#957;CO  and &#957;N2  , respectively. Observed shifts of &#957;CO  and &#957;N2  are explained by an interplay between electrostatic effects (blue shift), due to the positive partial charge, and by &#960;&#8208;backdonation (red shift). Energy decomposition analysis and analysis of natural orbitals for chemical valence support all conclusions based on the experimental results. This establishes a rational understanding of [B12X11]&#8208;  reactivety dependent on the substituent X and provides first systematic data on &#960;&#8208;backdonation from delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems of  closo  &#8208;borate anions.</dc:description>
