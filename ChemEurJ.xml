         <title>Syntheses of diarylmethanes via an oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives under quaternary ammonium hypoiodite catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report two strategies for the quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;mediated oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives. By using either dibenzoylperoxide or H2O2 in hexafluoroisopropanol in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide gives access to activated intermediates which can then be coupled with electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds. Overall, this sequential two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot procedure gives access to diversely decorated diarylmethane derivatives straightforwardly. Furthermore, the suitability of these products to undergo further oxidation reactions was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Insight into Complexation Between Cyclocarbons and C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work conducts the comprehensive theoretical study on the non&#8208;covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano&#8208;Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2:1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. In C60@2C34 trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1:2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>A Review of Electrospun Carbon&#8208;based Nanofibers Materials Used in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical values (200&#8208;250 Wh kg&#8208;1), which cannot meet the fast&#8208;growing energy storage  demands. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the next&#8208;generation energy storage system owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g&#8208;1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg&#8208;1). Nonetheless, Li&#8208;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8208;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and issues faced by carbon&#8208;based nanofibers composites in the application of Li&#8208;S batteries are summarized, and the future development trajectory are outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of BCL&#8208;2 Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BCL&#8208;2 is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers. Herein, we report our efforts to develop a BCL&#8208;2 degrader by incorporating either venetoclax or Nap&#8208;1 derivative into chimeric compounds hijacking CRBN, VHL or IAP as the E3 ligase.







Abstract
BCL&#8208;2, a member of the BCL&#8208;2 protein family, is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Due to its aberrant activity, it is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers and represents an attractive target for the development of therapeutics that antagonize its activity. A selective BCL&#8208;2 inhibitor, venetoclax, was approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and other haematologic malignancies, validating BCL&#8208;2 as an anticancer target. Since then, alternative therapeutic approaches to modulate the activity of BCL&#8208;2 have been explored, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras. Despite numerous research groups focusing on developing degraders of BCL&#8208;2 family member proteins, selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTACs remain elusive, as disclosed compounds only show dual BCL&#8208;xL/BCL&#8208;2 degradation. Herein, we report our efforts to develop BCL&#8208;2 degraders by incorporating two BCL&#8208;2 binding moieties into chimeric compounds that aim to hijack one of three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and IAPs. Even though our project did not result in obtaining a potent and selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTAC, our research will aid in understanding the narrow chemical space of BCL&#8208;2 degraders.

         <title>Advancing Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol chemistry for one&#8208;pot bioconjugation is reported, highlighting its versatility and efficiency. This method enables dual, sequential, and orthogonal bioconjugation, facilitating multiple modifications in a single reaction. The approach simplifies complex biochemical processes, providing a streamlined and effective solution for advanced bioconjugation applications in research and development.







Abstract
Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1&#8197;h) and high yield (&gt;90&#8201;%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates.

     alt="Advancing Nitrile-Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrile-aminothiol chemistry for one-pot bioconjugation is reported, highlighting its versatility and efficiency. This method enables dual, sequential, and orthogonal bioconjugation, facilitating multiple modifications in a single reaction. The approach simplifies complex biochemical processes, providing a streamlined and effective solution for advanced bioconjugation applications in research and development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrile-aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo-selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1&#8197;h) and high yield (&amp;gt;90&#8201;%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide-oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first-of-its-kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates. Furthermore, the results highlight its potential for versatile applications across fundamental and translational biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Flavin Core via Donor Appendage for Selective Subcellular Bioimaging and PDT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel design around flavin core skeleton incorporating a methoxy&#8208;naphthyl appendage is reported. The novel flavin entity was found to be highly emissive probe for selective lysosome bioimaging application. Furthermore, photosensitization capability of the mNF was evaluated for photodynamic therapy application against the B16 skin cancer cells.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel flavin analogue as singular chemical component for lysosome bioimaging, and inherited photosensitizer capability of the flavin core was demonstrated as a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Fine&#8208;tuning the flavin core with the incorporation of methoxy naphthyl appendage provides an appropriate chemical design, thereby offering photostability, selectivity, and lysosomal colocalization, along with the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature, making it suitable for lysosomal bioimaging applications. Additionally, photosensitization capability of the flavin core with photostable nature of the synthesized analogue has shown remarkable capacity for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, making it a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Sialyllactose&#8208;Imprinted Nanogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different monomers were explored for the synthesis of imprinted nanogels targeting &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. A bottom&#8208;up platform including NMR spectroscopy, ARS titration, in silico studies and Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis provides a ranking and leads to the best material in terms of affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
We describe a facile method to prepare water&#8208;compatible molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP NGs) as synthetic antibodies against target glycans. Three different phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives were explored as monomers for the synthesis of MIP NGs targeting either &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. Starting from commercially available 3&#8208;acrylamidophenylboronic acid, also its 2&#8208;substituted isomer and the 5&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxymethyl cyclic PBA monoester derivative were initially evaluated by NMR studies. Then, a small library of MIP NGs imprinted with the &#945;2,6&#8208;linked template was synthesized and tested by mobility shift Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (msACE), to rapidly assess an affinity ranking. Finally, the best monomer 2&#8208;acrylamido PBA was selected for the synthesis of polymers targeting both sialyllactoses. The resulting MIP NGs display an affinity constant&#8776;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and selectivity towards imprinted glycans. This general procedure could be applied to any non&#8208;modified carbohydrate template possessing a reducing end.

         <title>Photoinduced Energy and Electron Transfer in a &#8216;Two&#8208;Point&#8217; Bound Panchromatic, Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY(Zinc Porphyrin)2 &#8211; Fullerene Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination approach has been developed to construct a multimodular donor&#8208;acceptor conjugate featuring &#960;&#8208;connected bis zinc porphyrin&#8208;bisstrylBODIPY and bipyridine functionalized fulleropyrrolidine. Upon full characterization of this conjugate by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical and time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, occurrence of ultrafast energy transfer from excited zinc porphyrin to bisstrylBODIPY and electron transfer involving C60 in the conjugate is demonstrated using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe technique.







Abstract
Structurally well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled supramolecular multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates play a significant role in furthering our understanding of photoinduced energy and electron transfer events occurring in nature, e.&#8201;g., in the antenna&#8208;reaction centers of photosynthesis and their applications in light energy harvesting. However, building such multi&#8208;modular systems capable of mimicking the early events of photosynthesis has been synthetically challenging, causing a major hurdle for its growth. Often, multi&#8208;modularity is brought in by combining both covalent and noncovalent approaches. In the present study, we have developed such an approach wherein a &#960;&#8208;extended conjugated molecular cleft, two zinc(II)porphyrin bearing bisstyrylBODIPY (dyad, 1), has been synthesized. The binding of 1 via a &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination of a bis&#8208;pyridyl fulleropyrrolidine (2), forming a stable self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex (1&#8201;:&#8201;2), has been established. The self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been fully characterized by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical methods, including TD&#8208;DFT studies. From the established energy diagram, both energy and electron transfer events were envisioned. In dyad 1, selective excitation of zinc(II)porphyrin leads to efficient singlet&#8208;singlet excitation transfer to (bisstyrly)BODIPY with an energy transfer rate constant, kEnT of 2.56&#215;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1. In complex 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, photoexcitation of zinc(II)porphyrin results in ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer with a charge separation rate constant, kCS of 2.83&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a charge recombination rate constant, kCR of 2.51&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1. For excitation at 730&#8197;nm corresponding to bisstyrylBODIPY, similar results are obtained, where a biexponential decay yielded estimated values of kCS 3.44&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 2.97&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a kCR value of 2.10&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1. The newly built self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been shown to successfully mimic the early events of the photosynthetic antenna&#8208;reaction center events.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Ultrapotent Tricyclic Ligands for FK506&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rigid, sp3&#8208;rich tricyclic scaffold has been designed as a module for the development of FKBP small molecule ligands and molecular glues. Structure&#8208;based design enabled the synthesized scaffold to precisely lock all functional groups for the optimal interaction with the protein target. Upon structural optimization, a dramatic improvement in cellular activity is observed for the substituted tricyclic FKBP ligands.







Abstract
Access to small, rigid, and sp3&#8208;rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506&#8208;binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate&#8208;mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely positions functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14&#8208;step gram&#8208;scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and N&#8208;acyl iminium cyclization. Structure&#8208;based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.

&lt;p&gt;Access to small, rigid, and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506-binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate-mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely positions functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14-step gram-scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl iminium cyclization. Structure-based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging Dehydrogenation and Hydrogenation in Heterogeneous Catalysis: A Demonstration of a Unified Catalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research showcases the dual dehydrogenation and hydrogenation capabilities of an innovative hybrid catalyst, illustrated through the cyclooctane&#8722;cyclooctene model. This hybrid catalyst combines a pincer iridium complex with Pd&#8722;Ru heterostructures, both supported on solid &#947;&#8208;alumina, serving as a compelling proof of concept for tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation processes.







Abstract
In the pursuit of enhancing the applications of hydrogen as an energy carrier, this research delved into the utilization of a singular hybrid catalyst capable of performing both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes for Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs). This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid catalyst, combining an organometallic pincer complex with Pd&#8722;Ru heterostructures supported on &#947;&#8208;alumina. Unlike conventional transition and noble metal nanoparticles, the use of a pincer complex offers exceptional thermal stability due to its aryl backbone, which is advantageous for various endothermic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons in LOHCs. This pioneering hybrid catalyst is a novel approach, demonstrating a proof of concept. In this study, we utilized the hybrid catalyst to investigate the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of a lower enthalpic system, specifically the cyclooctane&#8722;cyclooctene system. The dehydrogenation of cyclooctane was conducted at 443&#8197;K using tertiary butyl ethylene as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, while the hydrogenation of cyclooctene reaction catalyzed by Pd&#8722;Ru nanostructures occurred at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm H2. The results showed successful tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges were noted in terms of catalytic activity and recyclability, providing valuable insights for further refinement and optimization.

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations of (Anti)Aromaticity in Oxidized and Reduced Porphyrin and Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroelectrochemical studies of porphyrin and norcorrole reveal how the vis&#8208;NIR spectra report (anti)aromaticity, which switches upon oxidation and reduction. In contrast, the IR spectra are less informative.







Abstract
Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18&#960; neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16&#960; neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16&#960; porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18&#960; dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with H&#252;ckel's rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectra.

         <title>Thermally Stable P&#8208;Chiral Supramolecular Phosphines, their Self&#8208;Assembly and Implication in Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines with enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;% is reported. These phosphines are stable up to 150&#8201;&#176;C and can be handled in air for a few hours. They can self&#8208;assemble on metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh to produce chiral catalysts. The self&#8208;assembled Rh&#8208;complex catalyzes the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes to yield chiral compound with an ee of 99&#8201;% and near quantitative conversion.







Abstract
P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one&#8208;step synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd&#8208;2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd&#8208;2 catalyzed a direct P&#8722;C coupling of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;iodophenyl)urea (B1)/2&#8208;iodo /6&#8208;hydroxy pyridine (B2) and,produced corresponding ligands L1&#8211;L3. The P&#8722;C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phosphindol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24&#8197;hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self&#8208;assembled and produced L2&#8722;C1 (Pt), L2&#8722;C2(Pd), and L2&#8722;C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self&#8208;assembled P&#8208;chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2&#8722;C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2&#8722;C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.

         <title>Valorization of Corn Straw for Production of Glucose by Two&#8208;Step Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis is applied for selective degradation of corn straw to glucose production. As high as 32.2&#8201;% yield of glucose is achieved without additional catalyst and the active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation on glucose units of cellulose is crucial.







Abstract
Depolymerization of the cellulose part in lignocellulose to glucose is a significant step for lignocellulose valorization. As one of the main by&#8208;products of agricultural biomass in crop&#8208;producing filed, valorization of corn straw has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis was applied for selective depolymerization of the cellulose component of corn straw to glucose production. Most part of the hemicellulose component could be removed through high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment in the presence of low concentration of acetic acid, and then as high as 32.2&#8201;% yield of glucose was achieved in water at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h without additional catalyst. The active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation of hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups on glucose units of cellulose was shown to be crucial for the efficient valorization of corn straw for glucose production.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by Confinement of Cobalt Porphyrins in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt porphyrin was confined in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) leading to highly selective oxygen reduction towards H2O2. Moreover, the confinement led to a high stability during the electrochemical production and buildup of H2O2 for at least 5&#8197;h. Overall, this work shows that the use of MOFs to confine molecular complexes as single&#8208;site catalysts is an effective tool to enhance the stability and selectivity for electrochemical conversions.







Abstract
Sustainable alternatives for the energy intensive synthesis of H2O2 are necessary. Molecular cobalt catalysts show potential but are typically restricted by undesired bimolecular pathways leading to the breakdown of both H2O2 and the catalyst. The confinement of cobalt porphyrins in the PCN&#8208;224 metal&#8208;organic framework leads to an enhanced selectivity towards H2O2 and stability of the catalyst.

     alt="Selective Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by Confinement of Cobalt Porphyrins in a Metal-Organic Framework"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cobalt porphyrin was confined in a metal-organic framework (MOF) leading to highly selective oxygen reduction towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, the confinement led to a high stability during the electrochemical production and buildup of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for at least 5&#8197;h. Overall, this work shows that the use of MOFs to confine molecular complexes as single-site catalysts is an effective tool to enhance the stability and selectivity for electrochemical conversions.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Functionalized O&#8208;BODIPY Probes for Cations &#8211; A Selective Fluorescent Probe for Ba2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the design and synthesis and a fluorescence study of water&#8208;soluble benzo&#8208;crown ether substituted O&#8208;BODIPY dyes towards their fluorometric recognition behavior of cations. The benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped O&#8208;BODIPY shows a high affinity to Ba2+ enhanced water solubility and appropriate selectivity for detection of Ba2+ in the presence of other cations (cf. TOC).







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and sensing characteristics of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted BODIPY fluorescent probes (O&#8208;BODIPYs) 3, 4 and 5 equipped with differently sized benzo&#8208;crown ethers (cf. Scheme&#8197;1, 3 (benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5), 4 (benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and 5 (benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown7)). O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 exhibited in comparison to their known F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a (cf. Scheme&#8197;1) an improved solubility in aqueous medium and higher fluorescence quantum yields. Fluorometric study in aqueous solutions of 3, 4 and 5 in the presence of different cations show cation induced fluorescence enhancements (FE). Compared to the benzo&#8208;crown ether substituted F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a, we found for the free O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 higher fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f) but lower cation induced FEs. We show that in aqueous medium the fluorescence quenching process (OFF switching), a photoinduced electron transfer, in O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 is less effective and consequently sensitive and selective ON switching of the fluorescence by cations, too. Albeit these observations the novel benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped fluorescent probe 5 exhibits a good fluorometric Ba2+ selectivity and Ba2+ sensitivity in conjunction to their aqueous solubility.

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;oxamic Acids.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.</dc:description>

         <title>Helix&#8208;to&#8208;Disc Conversion of Thia[6]helicenes into Coronenes Facilitated by Sulfur Oxidation and Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes, with their unique helical structures, have long captured the interest of synthetic chemists, not only as end products, but also as versatile platforms for further chemical transformations. However, transforming [6]helicene into planar coronene typically requires harsh conditions and poses significant challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that replacing the terminal benzene ring of [6]helicene with a thiophene ring enables its photochemical transformation into coronene. Sulfur oxidation of the thiophene ring enables the corresponding thermal transformation, and the terminal tetrafluorination of the opposite benzene ring further accelerates this process, yielding 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The transformation begins with an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, whose activation energy is significantly lowered by these structural changes. Our findings underscore the utility of strategic modifications such as sulfur oxidation and fluorination in promoting this "helix&#8208;to&#8208;disc"&#160;conversion and opening new avenues for synthesizing functional polycyclic aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as an promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commerical applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity,&#160;large&#160;volume expansion and unstable soild&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low intial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance and short cycling lifepan. In this work, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx&#160;materials with lithium&#160;fluoride&#160;(LiF) modified by hydrothermal method and carbothermal&#160;modification. When the mass ratio of SiOx&#160;and LiF equals 1:0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention can be greatly improve form 30.2% to 76.7% after 200 cycles. The result is primarily&#160;because the enhancement&#160;of electrons and&#160;Li+&#8208;ions&#160;transport and&#160;the stability of SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition can hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presents the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx&#160;anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.</dc:description>

Both 2,4,6-tribiphenyl-4-yl-1,3,5-triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Irreversible Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation by Empolyment of Sarkosyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a widely used method for peptide and protein ligation due to ease of substrate preparation and fast enzymatic kinetics. But there are drawbacks that limit broader applications. Sorting motif in substrates may not be exposed to sortase efficiently due to folding or aggregation. In addition, the ligation is reversible under transpeptidation equilibrium that restricts ligation yield. Here we report a simple but robust method to overcome such limitations. By employment of sarkosyl, the detergent alters substrate conformation to raise sorting motif accessibility for sortase catalysis. Moreover, transpeptidation becomes irreversible presumably by formation of micelle to shield ligation products from sortase. In consequence, excellent yields were achieved from sortase variants with different substrate specificity. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), presenting a powerful approach for the conjugation of aggregation&#8208;prone substrates. Therefore, we believe the sarkosyl&#8208;enhanced SML could be widely applied in peptide and protein chemistry and the unique irreversible transpeptidation mechanism offers an insight to detergent&#8208;driven equilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Impact on the Supramolecular Organization of Chiral Phthalimide EmittersDisplaying Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials has attracted an increasing attention in the recent years due to their potential application in various advancing technologies, notably in bioimaging and displays. In this context, heavy atoms such as halogen ones revealed useful tools to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of molecular organic phosphors. However, the effect of halogen at the supramolecular level remains less understood, especially in the field of molecular crystals where additional factors can impact the phosphorescence emission. Here, we investigate external effect of halogens on the phosphorescence of chiral phthalimides molecular crystals. The results show that changing the nature of the halogen atom onto the phthalimide core leads to an evolution of the photophysical properties of the materials which does not necessarily follow the classical trend imposed by the expected internal heavy atom effect. Beyond this aspect, we showed that the halogen atom has a profound impact on the packing between the chromophores at the supramolecular level which is of paramount importance towards the optical properties (PLQY and lifetimes) of the different phosphors examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs &#8211; semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Titanium Nitrido Complexes Containing A Linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti Core with A Two&#8208;Coordinate Nitrido Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of titanium m2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N = {(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8211;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiCl] (1&#8208;Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M = Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear m2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M = Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 2&#8208;Li, 2&#8208;Na, and 2&#8208;K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K contain a m2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na includes a m3&#8208;nitrido ligand as part of a T&#8208;shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, selective decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (3&#8208;M) (M = Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy&#8208;N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Analysis of (g,g', g'', &#8208; Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) Aryl ethers as a Polar Aliphatic Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A route is developed to (g,g&#8217;,g&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl&#160; substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8208;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their tert&#8208;butyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Catalytic Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange of Free &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids. Existing methods, including biocatalysis and metal catalysis, typically require expensive deuterium sources or excessive use of deuterium reagents and often struggle with site selectivity. In contrast, our pioneering binary catalysis system, employing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 in the presence of inexpensive D2O with minimal stoichiometric quantities, facilitates efficient hydrogen/deuterium exchange at the &#945;&#8208;position of amino acids without the need for protecting groups in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. The process is highly compatible with most natural and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and derivatives, even those with potentially reactive functionalities. This advancement not only addresses the cost and efficiency concerns of existing methods but also significantly broadens the applicability and precision of deuterium labeling in biochemical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration controlling of carboxylic ester&#8208;based electrolyte for low temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low temperature has been a major challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to maintain satisfied electrochemical performance, and the main reason is the deactivation of electrolyte with the decreasing temperature. To address this point, in present work, we develop a low&#8208;temperature resistant electrolyte which includes ethyl acetate (EA) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as solvent and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) as the primary lithium salt. Due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB and FEC, a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF is formed on the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, contributing to higher stability and rapid desolvation of Li+ ions. The batteries with the optimized electrolyte can undergo cycling tests at &#8208;40 &#176;C, with a capacity retention of 83.9 % after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent compatibility with both LCO cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes, enabling a Gr/LCO battery to maintain a capacity retention of 90.3 % after multiple cycles at &#8208;25 &#176;C. This work proposes a cost&#8208;effective electrolyte that can activate potential LIBs in practical scenarios, especially in low&#8208;temperature environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Extended Aromatic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), including incorporation of &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks, &#960;&#8208;conjugation through highly conjugated linkages, as well as post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategies. Various approaches of growing films of such structures are also presented.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated materials are highly attractive owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a great opportunity for precise arrangement of building units in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline matrix and tuning of the properties through choice of functionalities or post&#8208;synthetic modification. With this review, we aim at summarizing both the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs. We give examples of direct synthesis using large, &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks. COFs featuring fully conjugated linkages such as vinylene, pyrazine, and azole are discussed. Then, post&#8208;synthetic modification methods that result in the extension of the COF &#960;&#8208;system are reviewed. Throughout, mechanistic insights are presented when available. In the context of their utilization as film devices, we conduct a concise survey of the prominent COF layer deposition techniques reported and their aptness for the deposition of fused aromatic systems.

         <dc:description>
2D C5N2 single atom catalysts are computationally screened for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and validate a universal structure descriptor has a volcanic relationship with the limiting potential.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit the flexible coordination structure of the active site and high utilization of active atoms, making them promising candidates for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions. By the aid of first&#8208;principles calculations based on DFT, we have systematically explored the NRR catalytic behavior of thirteen 4d&#8208; and 5d&#8208;transition metal atoms anchored on 2D porous graphite carbon nitride C

         <title>Crystal to Hydrogel Transformation in S&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;Cysteine&#8208;Containing Cyclic Dipeptides &#8208; Nanostructure Elucidation and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine derived cyclic dipeptides containing different amino acid partners produce self&#8208;assembled structures, and their hydrogelation propensities are highly governed by the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains. The hydrogels produced by the cyclic dipeptides are thermoreversible, thixotropic, and have the ability to remove toxic dyes from contaminated water.







Abstract
Cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are crucial building blocks for a range of functional nanomaterials due to their simple chemical structure and high molecular stability. In this investigation, we synthesized a set of S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based CDPs (designated as P1&#8208;P6) and thoroughly examined their self&#8208;assembly behavior in a methanol&#8208;water solvent to elucidate the relationship between their structure and gelation properties. The hydrophobicity of the amino acids within the CDPs was gradually increased. The present study employed a comprehensive array of analytical techniques, including NMR, FT&#8208;IR, AFM, thioflavin&#8208;T, congo&#8208;red CD, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and biophysical calculations like Hirshfield Surface analysis and DFT analysis. These methods revealed that in addition to hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid side chain significantly influences the propensity of CDPs to form hydrogels. Each CDP yielded distinct nanofibrillar networks rich in &#946;&#8208;sheet structures, showcasing unique morphological features. Moreover, we explored the practical application of these CDP&#8208;based hydrogels in water purification by utilizing them to remove harmful organic dyes from contaminated water. This application underscores the potential of CDPs in addressing environmental challenges, offering a promising avenue for the future development of these materials in water treatment technologies.

         <title>Modulating Heavy Atom Effect in Germylene for Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CzGe and its derivatives CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu are a series of low&#8208;valent germylene&#8208;based pRTP molecules in which CzGe exhibits an unprecedented orange afterglow with an utralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and a high quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, resulting from a balanced ISC and HAE that has been confirmed by experimental observation and theoretical calculation.







Abstract
Abstract: It is worth but still challenging to develop the low&#8208;valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene&#8208;based persistent phosphors by introduction of low&#8208;valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors CzGe and its series of derivatives, namely CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low&#8208;valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled GeCz had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors. This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry.

         <title>Investigating the Catalytic Site of Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 via Marine Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 (15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1) is a key enzyme that possesses an important role in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. The pocket of the enzyme plays the role of a chiral catalyst, and therefore chirality could be an important component for the design of effective enzyme inhibitors. To advance our knowledge on this concept, we developed a library of the identified chiral 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibitors and applied cheminformatic tools. Our analysis highlighted specific structural elements, which we integrated them in small molecules, and employed them as &#8220;smart&#8221; tools to effectively navigate the chemical space of previously unexplored regions. To this purpose, we utilized the marine derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) among with a small library of synthetic fragment derivatives, including a certain degree of stereochemical diversity. Enzyme inhibition/kinetic and molecular modelling studies has been performed in order to characterize structurally novel PE&#8208;based inhibitors, which proved to present a different type of inhibition with low micromolar potency, according to their structural features. We demonstrate that different warheads work as anchor, and either guide specific stereochemistry, or causing a time&#8208;depended inhibition. Finally, we prove that the positioning of the chiral substituents or/and the favorable stereochemistry can be crucial, as it can lead from active to completely inactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen and Chalcogen Activation by Nucleophilic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high utility of halogenated organic compounds has prompted the development of numerous transformations that install the carbon&#8208;halogen motif. Halogen functionalities, deemed as "functional and functionalizable" molecules due to their capacity to modulate diverse internal properties, constitute a pivotal strategy in drug discovery and development. Traditional routes to these building blocks have commonly involved multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, and the use of stoichiometric and/or toxic reagents. With the emergence of solid halogen carriers such as N&#8208;halosuccinimides, and halohydantoins as popular sources of halonium ions, the past decade has witnessed enormous growth in the development of new catalytic strategies for halofunctionalization. This review aims to provide a nuanced perspective on nucleophilic activators and their roles in halogen activation. It will highlight critical discoveries in effecting racemic and asymmetric variants of these reactions, driven by the development of new catalysts, activation modes, and improved understanding of chemical reactivity and reaction kinetics</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications such as protein N&#8208;glycosylation, significantly influence cellular processes. Dysregulated N&#8208;glycosylation, exemplified in Grp94, a member of the Hsp90 family, leads to structural changes and the formation of epichaperomes, contributing to pathologies. Targeting N&#8208;glycosylation&#8208;induced conformations offers opportunities for developing selective chemical tools and drugs for these pathologic forms of chaperones. We here demonstrate how a specific Grp94 conformation induced by N&#8208;glycosylation, identified previously via molecular dynamics simulations, rationalizes the distinct behavior of similar ligands. Integrating dynamic ligand unbinding information with SAR development, we differentiate ligands productively engaging the pathologic Grp94 conformers from those that are not. Additionally, analyzing binding site stereoelectronic properties and QSAR models using cytotoxicity data unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting specific Grp94 conformations induced by abnormal glycosylation, selectively disrupting pathogenic protein networks while sparing normal mechanisms.</dc:description>

These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting specific Grp94 conformations induced by abnormal glycosylation, selectively disrupting pathogenic protein networks while sparing normal mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Hydronaphthalide Monoanion: Isolation of the &#8220;red transient&#8221; Birch Intermediate from liquid Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birch reactions employing alkali metals in ammonia have been a well&#8208;established method for the reduction and functionalisation of aromatic compounds for nearly 100 years. Speculations regarding intermediates in the reaction pathway have been discussed since the beginning. We hereby report the isolation of NMe4(HNaph) (1), a kinetically trapped intermediate of the Birch reaction of naphthalene and sodium in liquid ammonia. 1 has been fully characterised and has been shown to continue to react to 1,2/1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene &#8211; the Birch product of the reduction of naphthalene. The reactivity of 1 was investigated towards activity as an electron and hydride transfer agent with both, elements and small organic molecules. 1 demonstrates a tamed reduction potential which allows for controlled reactions such as the selective formation of hexasulphide and hexaselenide anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Building 3D Crosslinked Graphene&#8208;MXene Nanoarchitectures Decorated with MoS2 Quantum Dots Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although MoS2 quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom&#8208;up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene frameworks decorated with MoS2 quantum dots (MQD/RGO&#8208;MX) via a convenient co&#8208;assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO&#8208;MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso&#8208; and macropores, well&#8208;dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45 mV, a small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec&#8722;1 as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS2 quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inspired by the previous machine&#8208;learning study that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors, seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives 1a&#8211;g (NHBA = 5) were designed and synthesized by one&#8208;step functionalization from a common precursor. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses confirmed that the molecular arrangements of 1b (the diethyl and ethylthienyl derivative) and 1c (the di(n&#8208;propyl) and n&#8208;propylthienyl derivative) in the crystal are classified into brickwork structures with multidirectional intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer integrals, as a result of incorporation of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of 1b and 1c had hole mobilities of 0.16 and 0.029 cm2 V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Strategy and Doping Copper on Metal&#8208;organic Framework Surface for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous photocatalysts are characterized by numerous grain boundaries and abundant unsaturated sites, which enhance reaction efficiency from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. However, amorphization strategies have rarely been used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Doping copper onto a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surface can regulate the electronic structure of photocatalysts, promote electron transfer from the MOF to Cu, and improve the separation efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pairs. In this study, an amorphous photocatalyst MOFw&#8208;p/Cu containing highly dispersed Cu (0, I, II) sites was designed and synthesized by introducing a regulator and in situ copper species during the nucleation process of MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). Various characterizations confirmed that the Cu species were anchored to the organometallic skeleton of the surface amorphization MOF structure. The synergistic effect of Cu doping and surface amorphization in MOFw&#8208;p/Cu can significantly enhance the CO and CH4 yields while promoting the formation of the multicarbon product C2H4. The approach holds promise for developing novel, highly efficient MOFs as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction, enabling the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster &#8211; Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. We have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pyridylation of Alkynamides with Pyridylboronic Acids: A Route to Functionalized Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic direct hydroarylation of alkynamides is a highly efficient approach for accessing functionalized trisubstituted arylalkenes with amide groups. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids, yielding diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary enamides in good to excellent yields (up to 94%). This reaction demonstrates broad tolerance towards various alkyl and aryl functional groups, providing convenient access to a diverse array of alkenylpyridine derivatives. To demonstrate potential applications in late&#8208;stage hydropyridylation, we synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aldehydes, and esters with high yields from the pyridylation product of Weinreb amides. This indirect expansion of the substrate scope enhances the practicality of this strategy. Additionally, the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone obtained can be further reduced to yield a chiral alcohol with a 99% ee, further demonstrating the versatility and potential utility of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6 &#8208; 7.5% with ammonia yield rates of 300 &#8208; 340 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1.&#160; Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Aromaticity Be Evaluated Using Atomic Partitions Based on the Hilbert&#8208;Space?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8211; meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, NAO, and IAO &#8211; as reliable and economical alternatives to real&#8208;space partitions commonly used to measure aromaticity. These new partitions enable the study of larger molecular rings, previously limited by numerical integration errors in real&#8208;space partitions.







Abstract
Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry that explains the stability and reactivity of many compounds by identifying atoms within a molecule that form an aromatic ring. Reliable aromaticity indices focus on electron delocalization and depend on atomic partitions, which give rise to the concept of an atom&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;molecule (AIM). Real&#8208;space atomic partitions present two important drawbacks: a high computational cost and numerical errors, limiting some aromaticity measures to medium&#8208;sized molecules with rings up to 12 atoms. This restriction hinders the study of large conjugated systems like porphyrins and nanorings. On the other hand, traditional Hilbert&#8208;space schemes are free of the latter limitations but can be unreliable for the large basis sets required in modern computational chemistry. This paper explores AIMs based on three robust Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8211; meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, Natural Atomic Orbitals (NAO), and Intrinsic Atomic Orbitals (IAO) &#8211; which combine the advantages of real&#8208;space partitions without their disadvantages. These partitions can effectively replace real&#8208;space AIMs for evaluating the aromatic character. For the first time, we report multicenter index (MCI) and Iring values for large rings and introduce ESIpy, an open&#8208;source Python code for aromaticity analysis in large conjugated rings.

         <title>Probing the Electron Accepting Ability of Phosphaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron accepting ability of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide was systematically investigated by chemical and electrochemical methods as well as computational studies. Chemical reduction of phosphaphenalene by alkali metals leads to the formation of phosphaphenalenide anion. The successive reduction of pentavalent P&#8208;oxide gives rise to radical anion and dianion salts.







Abstract
Phosphaphenalenes, extended &#960; conjugates with the incorporation of phosphorus, are attractive avenues towards molecular materials for the applications in organic electronics, but their electron accepting ability have not been investigated. Herein we present systematic studies on the reductive behavior of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide by chemical and electrochemical methods. The chemical reduction of the phosphaphenalene by alkali metals reveals the facile P&#8722;C bond cleavage to form phosphaphenalenide anion, which functions as a transfer block for structure modification on the phosphorus atom. In contrast, the pentavalent P&#8208;oxide reacts with one or two equivalents of elemental sodium to form stable radical anion and dianion salts, respectively.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfones, Sulfonamides and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has encouraged chemists to discover new synthetic transformations in a more effective, mild, and safe manner. This Perspective critically analyses the most relevant photocatalytic strategies on the chemistry of sulfur (VI) compounds, with particular emphasis on sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfoximines. Based on selected examples, future directions within the field are presented. Finally, open synthetic challenges along with possible future solutions are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;based functional groups are popular scaffolds in a wide variety of research fields including synthetic and medicinal chemistry, as well as chemical biology. The growing interest in sulfur(VI)&#8208;containing molecules has motivated the scientific community to explore new methods to synthesize and modify them. Here, photocatalysis plays a key role granting access to new types of reactivity under mild reaction conditions. In this Perspective, we present a selection of works reported in the last six years focused on the photocatalytic assembly and reactivity of sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfoximines. We addressed the key synthetic intermediates for each transformation, while discussing limitations and strength points of the protocols. Future directions of the field are finally presented.

         <title>Highly Efficient Quenching of Singlet Oxygen by DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DNA origami nanostructures is investigated in an antimicrobial photodynamic therapy setting, using light irradiation of methylene blue to generate a mixture of radicals and singlet oxygen. DNA origami nanostructures are found to be vastly superior to genomic double&#8208;stranded DNA and established ROS scavengers in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage.







Abstract
DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their scavenging efficiency toward ROS radicals was shown to be comparable to that of genomic DNA. Herein, we demonstrate that DONs are highly efficient singlet oxygen quenchers outperforming double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA by several orders of magnitude. To this end, a ROS mixture rich in singlet oxygen is generated by light irradiation of the photosensitizer methylene blue and its cytotoxic effect on Escherichia coli cells is quantified in the presence and absence of DONs. DONs are found to be vastly superior to dsDNA in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage and even surpass established ROS scavengers. At a concentration of 15&#8197;nM, DONs are about 50&#8201;000 times more efficient ROS scavengers than dsDNA at an equivalent concentration. This is attributed to the dominant role of singlet oxygen, which has a long diffusion length and reacts specifically with guanine. The dense packing of the available guanines into the small volume of the DON increases the overall quenching probability compared to a linear dsDNA with the same number of base pairs. DONs thus have great potential to alleviate oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings.

         <title>Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis on the Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction of Aminochalcone: Catalytic Performance and Chalcogen Bond Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several mono&#8208;/bis&#8208;dentate hypervalent chalcogen bond donors were applied to catalyze the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The electron density of the chalcogen bond, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process and can be used to predict the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non&#8208;covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono&#8208;dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB1 was comparable to that of bis&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB4, and stronger than that of mono&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB2 and ChB3. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8722;C&#8722;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Several mono-/bis-dentate hypervalent chalcogen bond donors were applied to catalyze the intramolecular Aza-Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The electron density of the chalcogen bond, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process and can be used to predict the catalytic activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non-covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza-Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon-nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono-dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; was comparable to that of bis-dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and stronger than that of mono-dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ChB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8722;C&#8722;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction. The electron density of the chalcogen bond of the pre-complex, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process, which provides an idea to predict the catalytic activity of the ChB catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Benzophenazine Derivatives for Homogeneous and Heterogenized Photooxygenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new familly of benzophenazine derivatives was designed as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. Extensive structure activity relationship was carried out using both experimental and theoretical approach. The most promising candidate was immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen is a powerful oxidant used in various applications, such as organic synthesis, medicine, and environmental remediation. Organic and inorganic photosensitizers are commonly used to generate this reactive species through energy transfer with the triplet ground state of oxygen. We describe here a series of novel benzophenazine derivatives as a promising class of photosensitizers for singlet oxygen photosensitization. In this study, we investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of these benzophenazine derivatives. Akin to a molecular compass, the southern fragment was first functionalized with either aromatic tertiary amines, alkyl tertiary amines, aromatic sulfur groups, alkyl sulfur groups, or cyclic ethers. Enhanced photophysical properties (in terms of triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime, absorption wavelength, triplet state energy, and O2 quenching capabilities) were obtained with cyclic ether and sulfur groups. Conversely, the presence of an amine moiety was detrimental to the photocatalysts. The western and northern fragments were also investigated and slightly undesirable to negligible changes in photophysical properties were observed. The most promising candidate was then immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation reaction. A high NMR yield of 97&#8201;% in desired product was obtained, with only a slight decrease over several recycling runs (85&#8201;% in the fourth run). These results provide insights into the design of efficient photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation and the development of heterogeneous systems.

         <title>A Photoredox Thiol&#8208;yne Reaction for the Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Coumarins and its Effect on Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;compatible, photoredox&#8208;based synthesis of fluorescent coumarins, bearing a vinyl sulfide as an electron&#8208;donating group, was developed; subsequently, the photophysical properties of these derivatives were examined.







Abstract
Coumarins still remain one of the most widely explored fluorescent dyes, with a broad spectrum of applications spanning various fields, such as molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, or medical sciences. Their fluorescence is strongly based on a push&#8208;pull mechanism involving an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), mainly located at the C7 or C8 positions of the dye core. Unfortunately, up to now, these positions have been very limited to hydroxyl or amino groups. In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol&#8208;yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium&#8208; or porphyrin&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late&#8208;stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in a single&#8208;step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;benzothiazole, 6&#8211;8&#8208;difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204&#8197;nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.

         <title>Mausolates: Large&#8208;Cavity Chelates with Potential as Delivery Vehicles in Nuclear Medicine
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their long and illustrious history as ligands in inorganic chemistry, no cage complexes based on tris(pyrazolyl)borate units are known. We describe herein the facile synthesis of exceptionally stable nonadentate mausolate cages based on this unit and demonstrate their rapid uptake of lanthanide ions from dilute solution. The large cavity makes mausolates extremely appealing as delivery agents for large radionuclides in nuclear medicine.







Abstract
A new type of diborate clathrochelate (cage) ligand featuring nine inwardly pointing nitrogen donors that form a large, rigid cavity, termed a mausolate, is presented. The cavity size and high denticity make this an attractive delivery vehicle for large radionuclides in nuclear medicine. Metal mausolate complexes are stable to air and water (neutral pH) and display extremely high thermal stability (&gt;400&#8201;&#176;C). Lanthanide uptake by the mausolate ligand occurs rapidly in solution at room temperature and once complexed, the lanthanide ions are not displaced by a 250&#8208;fold excess of a competitive lanthanide salt over more than one week.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol represents an environmentally benign C&#8722;H arylation approach in the heterogeneous phase. Magnetically isolable iron oxide nanoparticles are introduced as a potent photocatalyst for the directed and non&#8208;directed C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming methods with a broad range of substrates. Thorough catalytic characterization and detailed mechanistic investigations are performed to justify the presented scientific advancements.







Abstract
A magnetically isolable iron oxide nanoparticles is introduced as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation employing aryl diazonium salts as the aryl precursors. This first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based photocatalyst revealed versatile activities and is applicable to a wide range of substrates, demonstrating brilliant efficacy and superior recyclability. Detailed catalytic characterization describes the physical properties and redox behavior of the Fe&#8208;catalyst. Adequate control experiments helped to establish the radical&#8208;based mechanism for the C&#8722;H arylation.

         <title>A New Structural Motif in Aggregation of Methylalumoxanes: Non&#8208;hydrolytic Route by the Alkylation of Dicarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alumoxanes are typically produced via controlled hydrolysis of short&#8208;chain alkyl aluminium compounds which leads to oligomeric species that are usually difficult to obtain in crystalline form. Simultaneously, various alternative non&#8208;hydrolytic approaches to alumoxanes have also been used. In this work, we report on a&#160;new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a&#160;series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO2CCH2C(=CH2)CO2H), succinic acid (HO2CCH2CH2CO2H) and homophthalic acid (HO2CCH2C6H4CO2H). The reactions of AlMe3 with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4:1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me10Al6O4, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe3 in the 1:2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [(homophtalate)(AlMe2)2]2. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alumoxanes are typically produced via controlled hydrolysis of short-chain alkyl aluminium compounds which leads to oligomeric species that are usually difficult to obtain in crystalline form. Simultaneously, various alternative non-hydrolytic approaches to alumoxanes have also been used. In this work, we report on a&#160;new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a&#160;series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO2CCH2C(=CH2)CO2H), succinic acid (HO2CCH2CH2CO2H) and homophthalic acid (HO2CCH2C6H4CO2H). The reactions of AlMe3 with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4:1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me10Al6O4, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe3 in the 1:2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [(homophtalate)(AlMe2)2]2. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple protein modifications are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modifications of proteins are inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for protein dual functionalization. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Selective Anticancer Mechanisms: Dinuclear Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics Combined with Pt(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We exploration the in vitro activities of the dinuclear&#160;Mn2L2Ac&#160;and&#160;Mn2L2&#160;complexes (where HL = 2&#8208;{[di(2&#8208;pyridyl)methylamino]&#8208;methyl}phenol), possessing dual superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, both individually and in conjunction with various Pt(II)&#8208;complexes, either as mixtures or as&#160;the&#160;Mn2&#8208;Pt&#160;adducts. Our findings revealed a notable up to 50% enhancement in the viability of healthy human breast cells, contrasted with a viability decrease as low as 50% in breast cancer cells upon combined treatments with&#160;Mn2&#160;SOD mimics and Pt(II) complexes.&#160;Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the self&#8208;assembled&#160;Mn2&#8208;Pt&#160;adducts&#160;(isolated&#160;Mn2L2Pt&#160;and&#160;in situ&#160;Mn2L2Pt&#8217;), linking&#160;Mn2L2&#8208;core with the carboxylate group of&#160;PtDAPCl2&#160;(dichloro(2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid) platinum(II)). The SOD activity of the isolated&#160;Mn2L2Pt&#160;adduct (kSOD&#160;= 1.7 &#215; 107&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) remained intact. We elucidated key mechanisms underlying the observed biological effects.&#160;We demonstrated that&#160;Mn2&#8208;containing formulations predominantly target mitochondrial processes, differently affecting the proteome of cancerous and healthy cells. They induced downregulation of H2S signaling and expression of mitochondrial complex I and III, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation pathways and upregulation of EGFR in cancer cells. In contrast, healthy cells showed a decrease in EGFR expression and a moderate enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1:2 mol mol&#8211;1) and ChCl/urea (1:2 mol mol&#8211;1), these reactions yield up to 97% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12 h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure&#8217;s eco&#8208;friendliness is validated&#160; by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between aldehydes or ketones and alkynes &#8211;the carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8211; constitutes a very useful strategy for the synthesis of a,b&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now demonstrate that iodine is a highly efficient catalyst for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular metathesis reaction in very small concentrations (0.1&#8211;1 mol%). Our protocol outperforms other catalytic systems, is operationally very simple, cheap, metal&#8208;free, and tolerates a large variety of functional groups (e.g., &#8211;CN, &#8211;CO2Me, &#8211;Br, &#8211;OH) at very low catalyst loadings. We can furthermore show that iodine&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metatheses can be combined with other iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one&#8208;pot procedures to afford larger and more complex molecular structures. Finally, our mechanistic studies indicate that the iodonium ion is the active catalyst under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>CaLi2PN3 &#8211; A Quaternary Chain&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate by Medium&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitridophosphates are in the focus of current research interest due to their structural versatility and properties, such as ion conductivity, ultra&#8208;incompressibility and luminescent properties when doped with suitable activator ions. Multinary representatives often require thorough investigation due to the competition with the thermodynamically more stable binary and ternary compounds. Another point of concern is the synthetic control of structural details, which is usually limited by conventional bottom&#8208;up syntheses. In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary nitridophosphate CaLi2PN3. Various synthesis protocols were used for the preparation of CaLi2PN3, including the novel nitridophosphate double salt approach. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by Rietveld refinement, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, EDX measurements and low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The experimental results were corroborated by DFT calculations, which revealed the electronic band structure. Formation energy calculations allowed conclusions to be drawn about the stability in comparison to the initial ternary nitridophosphates. The synthesis of CaLi2PN3 exemplifies the enormous potential of medium&#8208;pressure syntheses in the field of nitridophosphate research. Furthermore, the presented new synthesis route allows a certain degree of structural control, which is a promising addition to previous synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrel bond affects the self&#8208;assembly of acetylcholine and its analogues and is an ancillary interaction in protein binding</title>

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8208;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5] &gt; [6&#8208;5] &gt; [6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by distorting the system and delocalizing the LUMOs all over the cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Polymer as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for C&#8208;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of solar energy utilization, there is a growing focus on designing and implementing effective photocatalytic systems, for the conversion of solar energy into valuable chemical fuels. The potential of Covalent Organic Polymers (COPs) as photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformation has been widely investigated, positioning them as promising candidates in this field. In the design of COPs, introducing a donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement facilitates the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor, creating a charge transfer complex and leading to enhanced conductivity and improved charge separation. Here we present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz containing TPE donor and pyridine acceptor. Utilizing this, an efficient method has been developed for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8208;S bond formation. This process involves arylhydrazines and arenethiols, and results in the production of unsymmetrical diaryl sulfides via the formation of aryl and thioarene radicals. This conversion holds significant importance because the byproducts produced during the process are nitrogen and water, making it environmentally benign.</dc:description>

         <title>THE QUEST FOR STABLE BOROZENE CORE IN MAIN&#8208;GROUP CAPPED INVERSE SANDWICH COMPLEXES, [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8208; (E=B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous chemistry of benzene led us to explore ways to stabilise&#160;analogous borozene, by capping them with appropriate groups. The mismatch in overlap of ring&#8208;cap fragment molecular orbitals in [(HB)2B6H6]2&#8208;&#160;is overcome by replacing the two BH caps with&#160;&#160;higher congeners of boron. We calculated the relative energies of all the polyhedral structural candidates for&#160;[(HE)2B6H6]2&#8208;&#160;(E = Al&#8208;Tl)&#160;and found hexagonal bipyramid&#160;(HBP) to be more stable with Al&#8208;H caps. A global minimum search also gives HBP as the most stable structure for [Al2B6H8]2&#8208;. The capped B6H6&#160;ring in&#160;[(HAl)2B6H6]2&#8208;&#160;has aromaticity comparable to that of benzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking microenvironmental response on self&#8208;assembled phthalocyanine systems &#8211; adaptive and non&#8208;adaptive antibacterial photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behaviour of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behaviour while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Twisted Aromatic Donor Effect on the Nonlinear Response of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type Malononitrile&#8208;Derived Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the design, synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of a novel series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type malononitrile&#8208;derived chromophores, BTC&#8208;1 to BTC&#8208;4. Combining various spectroscopic techniques, nonlinear Z&#8208;scan measurements, and quantum chemical calculations, we revealed the intricate relationship between nonlinear optical properties and the interplay of molecular structure, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and dipole moments (&#956;). Our experimental and computational findings corroborate that the polarization degree in the ground state, the charge separation in the excited state and ICT collectively dictate the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds. Notably, BTC&#8208;1 exhibits an exceptional nonlinear absorption coefficient &#946; value (2 &#215; 10&#8208;8 m W&#8208;1), attributed to its optimized charge transfer efficiency and pronounced degree of charge separation. Our findings provide actionable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic NLO materials with potential applications in advanced photonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Stepwise Double Dehydrogenation for the Formation of a para&#8208;Quinodimethane&#8208;Containing Undecacene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface synthesis of an isomer of undecacene, bearing two four&#8208;membered rings and two para&#8208;quinodimethane moieties, starting from a tetramethyl&#8208;substituted diepoxy precursor, is presented. The transformation implies a thermal double deoxygenation followed by a stepwise double dehydrogenation reaction on the Au(111) surface, locally induced by inelastic tunneling electrons. This results in the transformation of para&#8208;dimethylbenzene moieties into non&#8208;aromatic para&#8208;quinodimethanes. The structures and electronic properties of the intermediate and final products are investigated at the single molecule level with high spatial resolution, using both scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy. The experimental results are supported by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dots in Photodynamic Therapy: The Role of Dopant and Solvent on Optical and Photo&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) are novel carbon&#8208;based luminescent materials with wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing, bioimaging, drug transportation, optical devices, and beyond. Their advantageous attributes, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, antioxidant activity, photostability, small particle size (&lt; 10 nm), and strong light absorption and excitation across a broad range of wavelengths, making them promising candidates in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as photosensitizers (PSs). Further enhancements in functionality are imperative to enhance the effectiveness of CDs in PDT applications, notwithstanding their inherent benefits. Recently, doping agents and solvents have been demonstrated to improve CDs' optical properties, solubility, cytotoxicity, and organelle targeting efficiency. These improvements result from modifications to the CDs' carbon skeleton matrices, functional groups on the surface state, and chemical structures. This review discusses the modification of CDs with heteroatom dopants, dye dopants, and solvents to improve their physicochemical and optical properties for PDT applications. The correlations between the surface chemistry, functional groups, structure of the CDs and their optical characteristics toward quantum yield, redshift feature and reactive oxygen species generation, have also been discussed. Finally, the progressive trends for the use of CDs in PDT applications are also addressed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>KpsS1 Mediates the Glycosylation of Pseudaminic Acid in Acinetobacter Baumannii</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the critical role of potential glycosyltransferase KpsS1 in the glycosylation of Pseudaminic acid (Pse) in Acinetobacter baumannii, resulting in the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins. Furthermore, the glycosylation of Pse influences the morphology of A. baumannii and enhances the virulence potential of the bacterium in a mouse model.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram&#8208;negative pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in A. baumannii remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse&#8208;positive and negative A. baumannii clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse&#8208;positive A. baumannii strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;kpsS1, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of A. baumannii, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.

         <title>Polyarylene&#8208;Based Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyarylene&#8208;based anion exchange membranes feature ether&#8208;free, high molecular weight, and high pKa aromatic polymer networks. Designing strategies, including balancing rigid and flexible segments in the backbone, installing side chains for flexibility and ion conduction, and mechanical stabilization through crosslinking, can realize long&#8208;term durable power generation from the assembled fuel cells.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is an emerging and promising technology that can help realize a carbon&#8208;neutral, sustainable economy. Also, compared to the proton exchange membrane counterpart, AEMFC can achieve comparable cell outputs with lower costs due to the applicability of non&#8208;platinum group metal electrocatalysts for the reaction on the electrodes&#8217; surfaces. However, the wide application of the AEMFCs has been impeded by the unsatisfactory stability and performance of the hydroxide&#8208;conductive membranes in the past. Recently researchers have made breakthroughs using polyarylene (PA)&#8208;based AEMs. This article summarizes the recent advances of a class of AEMs with aromatic backbone without ether bonds, mainly synthesized by Friedel&#8211;Crafts polycondensation. Such PA&#8208;based AEMs showed high chemical/mechanical stabilities and ionic conductivity, and even the fuel cell with those AEMs showed impressive peak power density of up to 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In this concept article, we classify major strategies for making PA&#8208;based AEMs to show the recent trends, highlight synthesis, characterization, and properties, and provide a brief outlook.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the small superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ turned out to be a challenging task since stabilizing it in convenient superacids was not possible. Quantum chemical calculations predict a reduced C2 symmetry, yet experimental data confirms C2h symmetry in the solid state. The origin of this finding is fathomed based on X&#8208;ray structure analysis together with quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The acid&#8208;activation of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds plays a key role in a variety of electrophilic reactions, some of which are only accessible in superacidic media when a superelectrophilic dication is formed. To obtain structural and electronic information about these elusive species, the vicinal dication [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is synthesized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Since this superelectrophile could not be stabilized in convenient superacids, the usage of liquid SO2 turned out to be crucial. The experimental data are discussed together with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses quantify the superelectrophilic interactions found in the solid state.

         <title>Dual Basicity and Nucleophilicity of Organosodium Reagents in Benzylic C&#8722;H Additions of Toluenes to Diarylethenes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting on the dual basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium reagents, a new method for the benzylic C&#8722;H addition of toluenes to diarylethenes and ketones is described. Through careful reaction monitoring and trapping of key reaction intermediates, valuable mechanistic insights have been gained, together with a deeper understanding of the coordination preferences of sodium in these organometallic systems







Abstract
Profiting from the dual high basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium complexes, here we report the stepwise lateral metalation of a wide range of alkyl arenes (MeAr), mediated by hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble NaCH2SiMe3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PMDETA (PMDETA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), followed by nucleophilic addition to diarylethenes of the newly generated NaCH2Ar&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PMDETA complexes. This method grants access to a range of functionalised hydrocarbons in excellent yields and can be upgraded to catalytic regimes when using trans&#8208;stilbene, a 10&#8197;mol% of the alkyl sodium base and toluene as a solvent. Extending this approach to aromatic ketones leads to the formation of stilbenes under mild reaction conditions, resulting from the deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones. Combining spectroscopic studies with the trapping and characterisation of key reaction intermediates, mechanistic insights have been gained, advancing the understanding of coordination effects in organosodium chemistry, and shedding light on their special reactivity profiles.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes: Halogen&#8208;Doped Anthracene as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ElectrochemicaTransistor set&#8208;up proposed in this paper features the peculiar characteristics that a suitable functionalized materials acts both as the working electrode (in an electrochemical cell) and the gate (in the transistor source/gate/drain layout). Allowing for simultaneous potential control and electrical impedance measurement of the working/gate (anthracene is used as working/gate electrode).







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) crystals exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties with interesting applications. We present a rational and easy guide which allows to foresee the effective charge transfer co&#8208;crystal production and that is based on the comparison of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies of a donor and acceptor couple. For the sake of comparison, theoretical calculations have been carried out by using the cheap and fast PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian and pure HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ level of the theory. The results are then compared with experimental results obtained both by chemical (bromine and iodine were used as the acceptor) and electrochemical doping (exploiting an original experimental set&#8208;up by this laboratory: the electrochemical transistor). Infra&#8208;red vibrational experimental results and theoretically calculated spectra are compared to assess both the effective donor&#8208;acceptor (D/A) charge&#8208;transfer and transport mechanism (giant IRAV polaron signature). XPS spectra have been collected (carbon (1&#8197;s) and iodine (3d5/2)) signals, yielding further evidence of the effective formation of the CT anthracene:iodine complex.

         <title>A &#946;&#8208;Glucosyl Sterol Probe for in&#8197;situ Fluorescent Labelling in Neuronal Cells to Investigate Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at tackling neurodegenerative diseases, the potential effect of &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol on neuronal cells is investigated by means of fluorescent labelling of a synthetic derivative. Marked differences in neuron accumulation, metabolism, and impact on the lysosomes with respect to the un&#8208;glycosylated cholesterol derivative were observed.







Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol probe bearing a terminal alkyne moiety for fluorescent tagging enables the investigation of the neuronal and intracellular localization of this class of compounds involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The compound showed localization in the neuronal cells, with marked differences in the uptake and metabolism leading to enhanced persistence with respect to the un&#8208;glycosylated sterol analogue. In addition, a different impact was observed towards lysosomes, with the simple sterol probe showing the enlargement of the lysosome structures, while the &#946;&#8208;glucosyl sterol was less capable to alter the morphology of this specific organelle.

         <title>Robust, Reproducible, and Scalable Synthesis of Silver Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18 to 60&#8197;nm was developed. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents, allowing for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches.







Abstract
It remains a challenge to accomplish colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals marked by high quality, large quantity, and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency. Here we report a self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18 to 60&#8197;nm. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents. The new setup also allows us to easily optimize the amount of O2 (from air) trapped in the system, ensuring burst nucleation of single&#8208;crystal seeds, followed by their slow growth into nanocubes. Most significantly, the new setup allows for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches. The availability of high&#8208;quality Ag nanocubes in such a large quantity is anticipated to substantially boost their use in applications related to plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.

         <title>CoPS/Co4S3 Heterojunction with Highly Exposed Active Sites and Dual&#8208;site Synergy for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoPS and hexagonal Co4S3 were constructed into heterojunctions. The strain effect and the high specific surface area fully expose the reactive active sites. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively.







Abstract
Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS&#8208;based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance. Herein, CoPS/Co4S3 heterojunction was prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect&#8208;rich flower&#8208;like Co1&#8208;xS precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst&#8216;s ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.

&lt;p&gt;CoPS and hexagonal Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were constructed into heterojunctions. The strain effect and the high specific surface area fully expose the reactive active sites. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual-site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic and alkaline media, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS-based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance. Herein, CoPS/Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction was prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect-rich flower-like Co&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;S precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst&#8216;s ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual-site further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light induced decarboxylative alkoxyamination of carboxylic acids with TEMPO is disclosed. In the presence of FeBr2 and TEMPO, a large array of carboxylic acids including marketed drugs and biobased molecules is turned into the corresponding alkoxyamine derivatives. The versatility of the latter offers an entry towards molecular diversity generation from abundant starting materials and catalyst. Overall, this method proposes a unified and general approach for LMCT&#8208;based iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalization.

         <title>Enhancing Substrate Channeling with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Architectures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Situ encapsulation of multi&#8208;enzymes in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework was studied for Enhanced Substrate Channelling. The channel like porous structures within HOF facilitated the direct transfer of intermediates between GOx and HRP enzymes resulting in perfect substrate channeling with transient time close to 0&#8197;s. These HOF based structures also acted as protective barrier to preserve enzymes catalytic activity at extreme conditions prevalent at industrial processes.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) represent an emerging category of organic structures with high crystallinity and metal&#8208;free, which are not commonly observed in alternative porous organic frameworks. These needle&#8208;like porous structure can help in stabilizing enzymes and allow transfer of molecules between enzymes participating in cascade reactions for enhanced substrate channelling. Herein, we systematically synthesized and investigated the stability of HOF at extreme conditions followed by one&#8208;pot encapsulation of single and bi&#8208;enzyme systems. Firstly, we observed HOF to be stable at pH&#8197;1 to 14 and at high temperatures (up to 115&#8201;&#176;C). Secondly, the encapsulated glucose oxidase enzyme (GOX) showed 80&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of its original activity at 70&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;11, respectively. Thirdly, transient time close to 0&#8197;seconds was observed for HOF encapsulated bi&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction system demonstrating a 4.25&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity when compared to free enzymes with enhanced substrate channelling. Our findings showcase a facile system synthesized under ambient conditions to encapsulate and stabilize enzymes at extreme conditions.

         <title>Ligand Basicity and Chelate Effects on Sulfur Insertion vs. Sulfur Reduction by Zinc Thiolate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of zinc thiolate complexes was synthesized and their reactivity with elemental sulfur was studied. Dependent on ligand factors such as thiolate nucleophilicity, chelation, and overall complex charge, these complexes were observed to undergo sulfur insertion or thiolate oxidation via sulfur reduction.







Abstract
4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinate zinc thiolate complexes supported either by bis(carboxamide)pyridine frameworks or by substituted tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands react with elemental sulfur (S8) following two distinct pathways. Some zinc thiolate moieties insert sulfur atoms to form zinc polysulfanide complexes, while others reduce sulfur and oxidize the thiolate. Here, we compare the effects of ligand electronics, strain, and sterics for selecting the respective reaction pathway. These results show that chelating and electron&#8208;deficient thiolate ligands better stabilize persistent zinc&#8208;bound polysulfanide species.

         <dc:description>
An efficient and reproducible method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction is reported. By developing a hydrolysis&#8208;stable ImIm&#8208;Cl analog for phosphate activation, this P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction can be used to successfully synthesize biological important ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules. This method allows for pyrophosphate formation on peptides for the first time to synthesize ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.







Abstract
Biomolecules containing adenosine di&#8208; or triphosphate (ADP or ATP) are crucial for diverse biological processes. Synthesis of these biomolecules and development of their chemical probes are important to elucidate their functions. Enabling reproducible and high&#8208;yielding access to these ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules via conventional P(III)&#8208;P(V) and P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reactions is challenging owing to water content in highly polar phosphate&#8208;containing substrates. Herein, we report an efficient and reliable method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction through in&#8197;situ activation of phosphates using hydrolysis&#8208;stable 2&#8208;[N&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazoyl)]&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (2&#8208;MeImIm&#8208;Cl), providing the corresponding electrophilic P(V) intermediates for subsequent nucleophilic attack using their coupling partners. This P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction proceeded even in a wet reaction medium and showed a broad substrate scope, accommodating protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of ADP&#8208;ribose and nicotinamide adenine diphosphate analogs, ATP&#8208;containing biomolecules, and ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.

         <dc:description>
Based on the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arenes, using WP5&#11815;G as the energy donor and commercially available dyes DBT (acceptor I) and SR101 (acceptor II) as the energy acceptor, a supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy transfer was successfully constructed. Significantly, this system shows attractive applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices and latent fingerprint (LFP) imaging.







Abstract
The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging.

         <title>Mixed Tin Valence in the Tin(II/IV)&#8208;Nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel tin nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16 was prepared in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction from Sn3N4 and P3N5. It incorporates tin in mixed oxidation states +II and +IV in a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra. The material was characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Sn3P8N16 combines the structural versatility of nitridophosphates and Sn within one compound. It was synthesized as dark gray powder in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 6&#8197;GPa from Sn3N4 and P3N5. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group C2/m (no. 12), a=12.9664(4), b=10.7886(4), c=4.8238(2) &#197;, &#946;=109.624(1)&#176;) and shows a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra, incorporating Sn in oxidation states +II and +IV. The Sn cations are located within eight&#8208;membered rings of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra, stacked along the [001] direction. A combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations was used to confirm the mixed oxidation of Sn. Temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal a low thermal expansion of 3.6&#8197;ppm/K up to 750&#8201;&#176;C, beyond which Sn3P8N16 starts to decompose.

         <title>Rapid Access to Divergent Fused Polycycles Via One&#8208;Pot A3 Coupling and Intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of one&#8208;pot reaction and a derivation step is developed for concise construction of divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems from simple starting materials, providing a rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological activities. The one&#8208;pot reaction combines aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions under simple, open&#8208;air conditions.







Abstract
Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyproline II helix (PPII) is stabilized by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. The ability to tune PPII structure in water via changes in the electronic properties of the acyl capping group is demonstrated herein. More electron&#8208;rich acyl capping groups promote PPII, both at proline and non&#8208;proline residues, via stronger n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. In contrast, more electron&#8208;poor groups exhibit lower PPII.







Abstract
The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins, important in globular proteins, in intrinsically disordered proteins, and at protein&#8208;protein interfaces. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (&#960;*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#8594;&#960;* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8722;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X=10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8722;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8722;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII. The effects of acyl capping groups were further analyzed in X&#8211;DfpPGY&#8208;NH2 and X&#8722;ADfpPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, Dfp=4,4&#8208;difluoroproline. Data on these peptides indicated that acyl groups induced order Piv&#8208; &gt; Ac&#8208; &gt; For&#8208;. These results suggest that greater consideration should be given to the identity of acyl capping groups in inducing structure in peptides.

Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;APPGY-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non-proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII. The effects of acyl capping groups were further analyzed in &lt;b&gt;X&#8211;&lt;/b&gt;DfpPGY-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;ADfpPGY-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peptides, Dfp=4,4-difluoroproline. Data on these peptides indicated that acyl groups induced order Piv- &amp;gt; Ac- &amp;gt; For-. These results suggest that greater consideration should be given to the identity of acyl capping groups in inducing structure in peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Germyl Radical Generation via EDA&#8208;Catalyzed ET&#8211;HAT Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile generation of germyl radical was achieved by using photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using catalytic amounts of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any photocatalyst.







Abstract
We have established a facile and efficient protocol for the generation of germyl radicals by employing photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using a catalytic amount of EDA complex of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds simply upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any transition metal or photocatalyst. This protocol also affords silyl radical from silyl hydride.

         <title>Activation of SO2F2 at a Rhodium PNP Pincer Complex: Ligand Supported S&#8722;F Bond Cleavage to Generate NSO2F Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a PNP rhodium complex with SO2F2 led to the bimetallic rhodium(I) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2. Reactivity studies with XeF2 resulted in an oxidative addition at the Rh centres to give a Rh(III) fluorido complex.







Abstract
The &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8722;phosphine ligand precursor NH(CH2CH2PCy2)2 can be used for the synthesis of the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NHC2H4PCy2}][Cl] (1). The deprotonated complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NC2H4PCy2}] (2) shows a cooperative reactivity of the PNP ligand in the activation reaction of SO2F2 to yield the rhodium fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (3) by S&#8722;F bond cleavage. It is remarkable that no reaction was observed when 3 was treated with hydrogen sources e.&#8201;g. dihydrogen, organosilicon compounds such as triethylsilane or TMS&#8722;CF3 and different fluorine sources such as SF4 or Selectfluor&#174;. However, the treatment of complex 3 with XeF2 in the presence of CsF resulted in the formation of the unique fluorido rhodium(III) complex cis,trans&#8208;[Rh(F)3(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (4). In the presence of pyridine(HF)X or BF3 the fluorido complex 3 converted into the dicationic complexes [Rh(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2[XF]2, X=HF (5) or BF3 (6), respectively.

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through Self&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stable amides is synthesized, which can react with various nucleophiles like acyl chlorides under light irradiation. This controllable switched&#8208;on reactivity hinges on a rational&#8208;designed photo&#8208;activatable masked acyl donor reagent.







Abstract
Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.

         <title>Unusually Short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Contacts in Intramolecularly Cyclized Helically Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helically fused anthracene structure was cyclized through intramolecular Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the dichloro derivative, resulting in a cyclic structure with unusually short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;) within the inner region. This steric environment significantly influences the spectroscopic data and the bonding nature.







Abstract
The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5&#8197;ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44&#8201;%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8722;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

     alt="Unusually Short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Contacts in Intramolecularly Cyclized Helically Fused Anthracenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A helically fused anthracene structure was cyclized through intramolecular Ni(0)-mediated coupling of the dichloro derivative, resulting in a cyclic structure with unusually short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;) within the inner region. This steric environment significantly influences the spectroscopic data and the bonding nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular coupling of dichloro-substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X-ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X-ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5&#8197;ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44&#8201;%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high-frequency shift of the C&#8722;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl-substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unusual Stability of an End&#8208;on Superoxido Copper(II) Complex under Ambient Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
The unusual stability of an end&#8208;on superoxido copper complex, [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8901;&#8722;)]+ (Me6tren=tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine), observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), was investigated. It was found that the corresponding peroxide complex and the complexes [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+ and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+ participate in the overall reaction cycle.







Abstract
Superoxido copper complexes play an important role as usually short&#8208;lived intermediates in biology and chemistry. The unusual stability of an end&#8208;on superoxido copper complex observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) led to a detailed mechanistic investigation of the formation of [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8901;&#8722;)]+ (Me6tren=tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine) under ambient conditions. The persistence of the superoxido copper complex could be explained by a reaction cycle including the peroxido complex [(Me6tren)2CuII2(O2)]2+ together with [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+ and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+ in the overall reaction.

         <title>Reactivity of a Neutral Yttrium(III) Trimethyl Complex toward Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>

The 9&#8208;membered azacrown Me3TACN offers a versatile platform for examining multiple Y&#8722;Me reactivity/conversion. Neither steric pressure nor nitrophilic substrates favor displacement of Me3TACN, marking its suitability for assessing ligand class&#8208;dependent incremental 89Y NMR chemical shifts.







Abstract
The present study corroborates that the neutral tridentate N&#8208;ligand 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;triazacyclononane (Me3TACN) qualifies as a versatile platform to study selective ligand exchange with rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal alkyl complexes, herein [(Me3TACN)YMe3]. Treatment with Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic bis(dimethylsilyl)amine, HN(SiHMe2)2, gave selectively the mono&#8208;exchanged heteroleptic complex [(Me3TACN)YMe2{N(SiHMe2)2}]. Depending on the molecular ratio employed, the reaction of [(Me3TACN)YMe3] with AlMe3 resulted in the isolation/crystallization of [(Me3TACN)YMe2(AlMe4)] [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] or ion&#8208;separated [(Me3TACN)YMe(AlMe4)][AlMe4] [1&#8201;:&#8201;2] and [(Me3TACN)YMe(AlMe4)][Al2Me7] [1&#8201;:&#8201;3]. Analogous reactions with the heavier group 13 methyls GaMe3 and InMe3 generated mixed methyl/tetramethylgallato complex [(Me3TACN)YMe2(GaMe4)] and ion&#8208;separated [{(Me3TACN)YMe2}2{&#956;&#8208;Me}][InMe4]. Finally, dimethylalane, HAlMe2, converted [(Me3TACN)YMe3] into heteroaluminate [(Me3TACN)Y(HAlMe3)3], representing an AlMe3&#8208;supported, molecular yttrium trihydride complex. All compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), homo&#8208; and heteronuclear (13C, 27Al, 89Y, 115In) NMR as well as IR spectroscopies and elemental analyses.

Abstract
We synthesized 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;6,6,12,12&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;7,8,11,12&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;6H,10H&#8208;phenaleno[1,9&#8208;fg]pyrido[3,2,1&#8208;ij]quinoline (4), a julolidine&#8208;like pyrenyl&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, with pyrene substituted at the 2,7&#8208;positions on the HOMO/LUMO nodal plane. Using solid state molecular structures, photophysical data, cyclic voltammetry, DFT and LR&#8208;TDDFT calculations, we compare o&#8208;carborane and B(Mes)2 (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) as acceptor groups. Whereas the &#960;&#8208;acceptor strength of B(Mes)2 is sufficient to drop the pyrene LUMO+1 below the LUMO, the carborane does not do this. We confirm the &#960;&#8208;donor strength of the julolidine&#8208;like moiety, however, which raises the pyrene HOMO&#8208;1 above the HOMO. In contrast to the analogous pyrene&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))&#8208;pyrene VI, which exhibits dual fluorescence, because the rate of internal conversion between locally&#8208;excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) (from the pyrene to the carborane) states is faster than the radiative decay rate, leading to a thermodynamic equilibrium between the 2 states, 4 shows only single fluorescence, as the CT state involving the carborane as the acceptor moiety in not kinetically accessible, so a more localized CT emission involving the julolidine&#8208;like pyrene moiety is observed.

In contrast to the analogous pyrene-2-yl-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane, 2-(1-1,2-dicarbadodecaboranyl(12))-pyrene &lt;b&gt;VI&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibits dual fluorescence, because the rate of internal conversion between locally-excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) (from the pyrene to the carborane) states is faster than the radiative decay rate, leading to a thermodynamic equilibrium between the 2 states, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; shows only single fluorescence, as the CT state involving the carborane as the acceptor moiety in not kinetically accessible, so a more localized CT emission involving the julolidine-like pyrene moiety is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights Into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the activation of CO2 by 3d&#8211;4f catalysts, our combined DFT and ab initio calculations reveal the significance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity and the role of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in fine&#8208;tuning catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8211;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8211;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

Cation orders in both A and B sites can be controlled in the Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 perovskite solid solutions via aliovalent doping by Sb5+ only at B site realizing A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered/B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered, A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered/B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered, and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered/B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered structures.







Abstract
Cation order, which can be controlled by synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, plays an important role in properties of perovskite materials. Here we show that aliovalent doping by Sb5+ in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 quadruple perovskite solid solutions can control cation orders in both A and B sites. Samples with 0.4&#8804;x&#8804;2 were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature method at 6&#8197;GPa and 1770&#8197;K. Three regions with different cation orders were found at 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0, x=1.5&#8211;1.6, and x=1.8. The 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0 compositions have a B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/nmc; the x=1.5 and 1.6 samples have a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/n; the x=1.8 sample has a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered structure with space group P21/n. All the samples show one ferrimagnetic transition: TC increases from 35&#8197;K to 73&#8197;K for 0.5&#8804;x&#8804;1.0, TC=81&#8197;K for x=1.5 and 1.6, and TC=53&#8197;K for x=1.8.

In 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP), the Friedel&#8211;Crafts type cyclobutenylation reaction of several (hetero)aromatic compounds was smoothly proceeded by using gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes as easily available sources of cyclobutenyl cations.







Abstract
In 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP), gem&#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes, which can be prepared by the (2+2) cycloaddition reaction of Tf2C=CH2 with alkynes, underwent desulfination to generate the corresponding cyclobutenyl cation. This unique reactivity was successfully applied to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts type cyclobutenylation reaction of several (hetero)aromatic compounds.

         <title>Antiaromaticity of Cycloheptatrienyl Anions: Structure, Acidity, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloheptatrienyl anions are studied in terms of their acidity, structure, and antiaromatic properties. The substituents directly affect the acidity of the anion, while the magnetic properties originate from the geometry of the anion, which in turn is determined by the conjugation and steric properties of the substituents.







Abstract
Investigations of the nature and degree of antiaromaticity of cycloheptatrienyl anion derivatives using both experimental and computational tools are presented. The ground state of cycloheptatrienyl anion in the gas phase is triplet, planar and Baird&#8208;aromatic. In DMSO, it assumes a singlet distorted allylic form with a paratropic ring current. The other derivatives in both phases assume either allylic or diallylic conformations depending on the substituent pattern. A combination of experimental and computational methods was used to determine the pKa values of 16 derivatives in DMSO, which ranged from 36 to &#8722;10.7. We revealed that the stronger stabilization of the anionic system, which correlates with acidity, does not necessarily imply a lower degree of antiaromaticity in terms of magnetic properties. Conversely, the substitution pattern first affects the geometry of the ring through the bulkiness of the substituents and their better conjugation with a more distorted system. Consequently, the distortion reduces the cyclic conjugation in the &#960;&#8208;system and thereby decreases the paratropic current in a magnetic field, which manifests itself as a decrease in the NICS. The triplet&#8208;state geometries and magnetic properties are nearly independent on the substitution pattern, which is typical for simple aromatic systems.

         <title>Front Cover: Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ (Chem. Eur. J. 41/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This house of cards is a fragile construct that can collapse if the wrong move is made. Similarly, the stability of the small superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is a fragile equilibrium that is delicately balanced by donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Too much fluoride leads to superelectrophilic reactions, while too little fluoride means missing stabilization of the C2h structure. More information on how this balance is achieved can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400354).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 41, July 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to predict effective charge transfer (CT) in donor&#8211;acceptor (DA) co&#8208;crystals by comparing the frontier molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies of the DA couple is presented in this study. Using PM6 and HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ methods, theoretical results were compared with experimental data from chemical and electrochemical doping. The image illustrates a vacuum evaporation set&#8208;up with iodine as the acceptor. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Fontanesi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400519).

Asymmetric carbene transfer reactions increase molecular diversity for drug discovery.







Abstract
The quest to explore chemical space is vital for identifying novel disease targets, impacting both the effectiveness and safety profile of therapeutic agents. The tangible chemical space, currently estimated at a conservative 108 synthesized compounds, pales in comparison to the theoretically conceivable diversity of 1060 molecules. To bridge this vast gap, organic chemists are spearheading innovative methodologies that promise to broaden this limited chemical diversity. A beacon of this progressive wave is Asymmetric Carbene Transfer (ACT), a burgeoning strategy that significantly boosts molecular diversity with efficient bond&#8208;formation and precise chiral control. This review focuses on the capabilities of ACT in creating pharmaceutically significant molecules, encompassing an array of natural products and bioactive compounds. Through the lens of ACT, we discern its substantial influence on drug discovery, paving the way for novel therapeutic avenues by expanding the boundaries of molecular diversity. This review will shed light on prospective methodological developments of ACT and articulate their conceivable contributions to the medicinal chemistry arena.

         <title>Solvent Effect on Dative and Ionic Bond Strengths: A Unified Theory from the Potential Analysis and Valence Bond (VB) Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent molecules interact with a solute through various intermolecular forces. Here we employed a potential energy surface (PES) analysis to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics. The change of a bond is driven by the gradient (force) of the solvent&#8208;solute interaction energy with respect to the focused bond length. Positive force shortens the bond length and increases the bond force constant, leading to a blue&#8208;shift of the bond stretching vibrational frequency upon solvation. Conversely, negative force elongates the bond, resulting in a reduced bond force constant and red&#8208;shift of the stretching vibrational frequency. The different responses of Me3NBH3 and LiCl to solvation are studied with valence bond (VB) theory, as Me3NBH3 and LiCl are dominated by the neutral covalent VB structure and the ionic VB structure, respectively. The dipole moment of an ionic VB structure increases along the increasing bond distance, while the dipole moment of a neutral covalent VB structure increases with the decreasing bond distance. The roles of the dominating VB structures are further examined by the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations with the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method.</dc:description>

         <title>Aliphatic Ketone Claisen Rearrangement: Troubleshooting the Transetherification Step by Identifying a Stable Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>After optimization for retention of catalytic activity, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid emerged as the optimal catalyst for the aliphatic ketone Claisen rearrangement. The optimal catalyst enables a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free, catalytic protocol from allylic alcohols to &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The optimized process tolerates a range of substrates, including substituents with acid&#8208;labile protecting groups. Reaction monitoring and DFT studies of the aliphatic ketone Claisen process agree that the ultimate rearrangement step typically has the highest activation barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral and Anion Species of Quinoidal Thienothiophene Diketopyrrolopyrroles Display a Common Aggregation Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive investigation of two new molecular triads incorporating the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit into a quinoidized thienothiophene skeleton, which is further end&#8208;capped with dicyanomethylene (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;CN) or phenoxyl groups (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;PhO), has been carried out. A combination of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations has been used. The main result is the formation of similar H&#8208;aggregates in the dimerization process of the neutral molecules and of the charged anionic species. The experimental absorption spectra of the aggregated species are accurately reproduced by quantum chemical calculations using the Spano&#8217;s model, including excitonic coupling for the dimeric forms and full vibronic resolution of the absorption bands. The strong excitonic coupling taking place is key to understand the electronic structure of the dimeric aggregates and has been instrumental to disentangle the type of H&#8208;aggregation. This study is of relevance to get a better understanding of the molecular aggregation of organic p&#8208;conjugated chromophores and is useful as a guideline for the refinement of the engineering of molecular materials for which supramolecular design is required.</dc:description>

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Ferrocene Conjugate for the Combined Photodynamic Therapy and Chemodynamic Therapy with Improved Antitumor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can destroy tumor cells by generating singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is limited by the hypoxia of the neoplastic tissue. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can produce toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) to eradicate tumor cells by catalytic decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the therapeutic effect of which is highly dependent on the concentration of H2O2. Herein, we propose a BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with a balanced 1O2 and &#8226;OH generation capacity, which can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency antitumor agent by combining PDT and CDT. The ferrocene moieties endow the as&#8208;prepared conjugates with the ability of chemodynamic killing of tumor cells. Moreover, combined PDT/CDT therapy with improved antitumor efficiency can be realized after exposure to light irradiation. Compared with the monotherapy by PDT or CDT, the BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugates can significantly increase the intracellular ROS levels of the tumor cells after light irradiation, thereby inducing the tumor cell apoptosis at low drug doses. In this way, a synergistic antitumor treatment is achieved by the combination of PDT and CDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of N&#8208;Heteropolycyclic Aromatic Molecules: The Acridine Dimer and Trimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise aggregation of acridine isolated in solid neon is monitored using IR and UV spectroscopy. A theoretical study provides meaningful structures and insight into the special photophysics of the aggregates.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their nitrogen&#8208;substituted analogues are of great interest for various applications in organic electronics. The performance of such devices is determined not only by the properties of the single molecules, but also by the structure of their aggregates, which often form via self&#8208;aggregation. Gaining insight into such aggregation processes is a challenging task, but crucial for a fine&#8208;tuning of the materials properties. In this work, an efficient approach for the generation and characterisation of aggregates is described, based on matrix&#8208;isolation experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. This approach is exemplified for aggregation of acridine. The acridine dimer and trimer are thoroughly analysed on the basis of experimental and calculated UV and IR absorption spectra, which agree well with each other. Thereby a novel structure of the acridine dimer is found, which disagrees with a previously reported one. The calculations also show the changes from excitonic coupling towards orbital interactions between two molecules with decreasing distance to each other. In addition, a structure of the trimer is determined. Finally, an outlook is given on how even higher aggregates can be made accessible through experiment.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) As Hydrogen Storage Materials At Near&#8208;Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen as is difficult to store in significant quantities via physical methods especially at near&#8208;ambient temperatures (248&#8211;373&#8197;K). Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have the potential to increase hydrogen storage of conventional methods. This review surveys the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in advancing hydrogen storage at near&#8208;ambient temperatures, using mechanisms such open metal sites and hydrogen spillover.







Abstract
Hydrogen may play a critical role in our efforts to de&#8208;carbonize by 2050. However, there remain technical challenges in the storage and transport of hydrogen. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown significant promise for hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperatures. A material that can meet the US department of energy (DOE) ultimate goal of 6.5 wt. % for gravimetric performance and 50&#8197;g/L for volumetric storage at near&#8208;ambient temperatures would unlock hydrogen as a future fuel source for on&#8208;board applications. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks typically have low heat of adsorptions (i.&#8201;e. 4&#8211;7&#8197;kJ/mol), whereas for storing significant quantities of hydrogen at near&#8208;ambient temperatures, 15&#8211;25&#8197;kJ/mol is likely required. In this review we explore the current methods used (i.&#8201;e., open&#8208;metal sites, alkali dopants and hydrogen spillover) for promoting strong adsorption within MOFs. Further we discuss MOF&#8208;based materials with respect to the technical aspects of deliverable capacity, kinetics and stability.

In this review we explore the current methods used (i.&#8201;e., open-metal sites, alkali dopants and hydrogen spillover) for promoting strong adsorption within MOFs. Further we discuss MOF-based materials with respect to the technical aspects of deliverable capacity, kinetics and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiocarbonyl Pseudohalides &#8211; The Curious Case of Thiocarbonyl Dithiocyanate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constitutional and rotational isomerism and of two thiocarbonyl pseudohalide compounds are investigated with crystallography, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy, as well as DFT calculations. It is shown that solely the kinetic reaction products are isolated. Upon reacting thiocarbonyl dithiocyanate with ethanol, ethoxy substituted dithiobiuret is yielded with acts as a ligand towards Ni2+.







Abstract
Thiocarbonyl dithiocyanate (1) and chlorothiocarbonyl thiocyanate (2) were synthesized from thiophosgene and ammonium or silver thiocyanate, respectivley. Their crystal structures show syn&#8208;anti (1) and syn (2) conformations, which were confirmed in the bulk phases by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further calculations explain the isolation of the kinetic reaction products by a lower transition states opposed to the thermodynamic reaction products. Reaction of 1 with ethanol gave a dithiobiuret derivative (3). In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study we show that it in turn can be used for the complexation of nickel to yield (4).

         <title>A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination From Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni&#8208;PTFE Modified Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;PTFE hydrophobically modified electrodes are employed to perform an electrochemically catalyzed reduction reaction for the conversion of monoaromatic amides to diaromatic imides. The reaction may be a deamination C&#8722;N coupling reaction, which may include an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The process is completed at room temperature without adding any catalysts and redox reagents to maintain an acceptable conversion.







Abstract
A hydrophobic Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by 1H&#160;NMR, FT&#8208;IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8722;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one&#8208;electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.

         <title>Photochemical Aerobic Upcycling of Polystyrene Plastics via Synergistic Indirect HAT Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of plastic waste constitutes an excellent solution to the rising problem of plastic waste treatment. Synergistic HAT catalysis from thioxanthone and bromoacetonitrile is introduced for the photochemical aerobic upcycling of polystyrene plastics into benzoic acid.







Abstract
Plastic pollution constitutes an evergrowing urgent environmental problem, since overaccumulation of plastic waste, arising from the immense increase of the production of disposable plastic products, overcame planet's capacity to properly handle them. Chemical upcycling of polystyrene constitutes a convenient method for the conversion of plastic waste into high&#8208;added value chemicals, suggesting an attractive perspective in dealing with the environmental crisis. We demonstrate herein a novel, easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform organocatalytic photoinduced aerobic protocol, which proceeds via synergistic indirect hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis under LED 390&#8197;nm Kessil lamps as the irradiation source. The developed method employs a BrCH2CN&#8208;thioxanthone photocatalytic system and was successfully applied to a variety of everyday&#8208;life plastic products, leading to the isolation of benzoic acid after simple base&#8208;acid work up in yields varying from 23&#8211;49&#8201;%, while a large&#8208;scale experiment was successfully performed, suggesting that the photocatalytic step is susceptible to industrial application.

         <title>Synthesis of (Hetero)biaryls via Nickel Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Between (Hetero)aryl Iodides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (hetero)biaryls are fundamental to drug discovery and rapid, general access to these motifs is essential for medicinal chemistry. Herein, a nickel catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between heteroaryl iodides and bromides is described. We demonstrated that the reaction is chemoselective, scalable, and amenable to library fashion with an array of scaffolds (45 examples).







Abstract
(Hetero)biaryls are fundamental building blocks in the pharmaceutical industry and rapid access to these scaffolds is imperative for the success of numerous medicinal chemistry campaigns. Herein, a highly general, mild, and chemoselective reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between (hetero)aryl iodides and heteroaryl bromides is reported. By employing more reactive (hetero)aryl halides, a broad range of successful substrates (45 examples) were identified. The reaction was also found to be chemoselective for C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) bond formation between (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides over (hetero)aryl chlorides, which were generally inert under the described reaction conditions. The efficiency of the procedure is also further demonstrated in parallel synthesis library format, on gram scale, as well as in the formal synthesis of Ruxolitinib, a potent JAK inhibitor. As such, we anticipate this method will find widespread utility in the assembly of (hetero)biaryls for medicinal chemistry efforts.

         <title>Applications of Metals and Metal Compounds in Improving the Sensitivity of Microfluidic Biosensors &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our review explores the evolution of microfluidic sensors, emphasizing the shift from enzyme&#8208;based to enzyme&#8208;free cascade amplification methods. We address challenges in enzyme&#8208;based reactions and propose metallic nanomaterials as promising alternatives. Highlighting their unique properties like SPR and SERS, we discuss their role in enhancing detection sensitivity. Additionally, we underscore the potential of metal&#8208;based catalytic nanomaterials. This review offers valuable insights and future research directions, contributing to the advancement of microfluidic biosensors.







Abstract
The enhancement of detection sensitivity in microfluidic sensors has been a continuously explored field. Initially, many strategies for sensitivity improvement involved introducing enzyme cascade reactions, but enzyme&#8208;based reactions posed challenges in terms of cost, stability, and storage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore enzyme&#8208;free cascade amplification methods, which are crucial for expanding the application range and improving detection stability. Metal or metal compound nanomaterials have gained great attention in the exploitation of microfluidic sensors due to their ease of preparation, storage, and lower cost. The unique physical properties of metallic nanomaterials, including surface plasmon resonance, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption, contribute significantly to enhancing detection capabilities. The metal&#8208;based catalytic nanomaterials, exemplified by Fe3O4 nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are considered viable alternatives to biological enzymes due to their excellent performance. Herein, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of metals and metal compounds in improving the sensitivity of microfluidic biosensors. This review not only highlights the current developments but also critically analyzes the challenges encountered in this field. Furthermore, it outlines potential directions for future research, contributing to the ongoing development of microfluidic biosensors with improved detection sensitivity.

         <title>Hybrid Ethylcellulose Polymeric Films: Ag(I)&#8208;Based Components and Curcumin as Reinforcing Ingredients for Enhanced Food Packaging Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylcellulose films embedding the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; polymer and the binary co&#8208;crystal [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc, as active ingredients, have been prepared through solvent casting. The not innocent role of Ethylcellulose along the film forming process was highlighted by the deep investigation performed on the prepared samples. High antibacterial activity with low Silver release was found for the films incorporating the Ag(I) species.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;active ethylcellulose (EC) polymeric films have been obtained by incorporating curcumin (curc) and Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds, known for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, respectively, within the polymeric matrix. The recently reported Ag(I) coordination polymer, in both its structural forms (&#945;&#8208;[(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; and &#946;&#8208;{[(bpy)Ag][OTf]}&#8734;), and the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc polymeric co&#8208;crystal (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; OTf=trifluoromethanesulfonate) have been selected as Ag(I) species. The hybrid composite films have been prepared through the simple solvent casting method and characterized through Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The deep investigation of the film samples highlighted the non&#8208;inert behaviour of EC towards these specific active ingredients. Antimicrobial tests showed that EC films embedding the Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds present good antimicrobial performance, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, used as a model of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In addition, Silver migration tests, performed on the Ag(I)&#8208;incorporating EC films, evidenced low values of silver release particularly in the case of the EC films incorporating [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc.

         <title>Copper Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation Reaction of Exocyclic Sulfonyl Enamides for the Synthesis of N,O&#8208;Spiroketal and Spiroketal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation reaction of exocyclic enamines with 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone esters has been developed, providing facile access to various N,O&#8208;spiroketals and spiroketals.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation reaction of exocyclic enamines/enol ethers with 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone esters has been developed, providing facile access to N,O&#8208;spiroketals and spiroketals under mild conditions with broad substrate scope (26 examples, 71&#8211;94&#8201;% yields). Gram scale synthesis and chemical transformations demonstrated that this method is potentially useful in the synthesis of natural products and drugs containing a N,O&#8208; spiroketal moiety. The chiral N,O&#8208;spiroketal could be obtained with 98&#8201;% ee after recrystallization, when a chiral SaBOX ligand was employed.

         <title>Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biological Activity of the Selective TACR2 Antagonist Tumonolide and its Aldehyde from a Marine Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the isolation of tumonolide and its aldehyde from a marine cyanobacterium. The relative and absolute stereochemistry of tumonolide were determined utilizing various spectroscopic and computational methods. Functional screening against a GPCR panel, molecular docking and global profiling using RNA sequencing provided the biological profile of tumonolide.







Abstract
The macrocyclic tumonolide (1) with enamide functionality and the linear tumonolide aldehyde (2) are new interconverting natural products from a marine cyanobacterium with a peptide&#8208;polyketide skeleton, representing a hybrid of apratoxins and palmyrolides or laingolides. The planar structures were established by NMR and mass spectrometry. The relative configuration of the stereogenically&#8208;rich apratoxin&#8208;like polyketide portion was determined using J&#8208;based configuration analysis. The absolute configuration of tumonolide (1) was determined by chiral analysis of the amino acid units and computational methods, followed by NMR chemical shift and ECD spectrum prediction, indicating all&#8208;R configuration for the polyketide portion, as in palmyrolide A and contrary to the all&#8208;S configuration in apratoxins. Functional screening against a panel of 168 GPCR targets revealed tumonolide (1) as a selective antagonist of TACR2 with an IC50 of 7.0&#8197;&#956;M, closely correlating with binding affinity. Molecular docking studies established the binding mode and rationalized the selectivity for TACR2 over TACR1 and TACR3. RNA sequencing upon treatment of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells demonstrated activation of the pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic signaling pathway and the insulin secretion signaling pathway at 20&#8197;&#956;M, indicating its potential to modulate these pathways.

The incorrect IUPAC name makes the carbon atom hexavalent at two different places and misplaces the carbonyl groups in two other places.







Abstract
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name given in the title is incorrect. The correct IUPAC name for this molecule is tetraspiro[2.1.25.1.29.1.213.13]hexadecane&#8208;4,8,12,16&#8208;tetraone. The incorrect name given in the title, unfortunately, makes the carbon atom hexavalent at two different (3 and 5) positions. In addition, the two other keto groups (at positions 1 and 7) would appear on two of the cyclopropane rings if one adopts to the incorrect name. Nevertheless, this wrong name is a good example to discuss the importance of IUPAC nomenclature in the classroom with students.

         <title>Redox&#8208;triggered Reversible Switching between Dynamic and Quasi&#8208;static &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the reversible transformation between a singly stapled dynamic &#945;&#8208;helical peptide and a doubly stapled quasi&#8208;static one through redox&#8208;triggered dithiol/disulfide conversions of a stapling moiety. This process allows the rate of interconversion between the right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) &#945;&#8208;helices to be altered by a factor of approximately 103 before and after the transformation. An as&#8208;obtained doubly stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptide, which is composed of an achiral peptide having an L&#8208;valine carboxylic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminus, a disulfide&#8208;based reversible staple, and a biphenyl&#8208;based fixed staple, adopts an (M)&#8208;rich form as a kinetically trapped state. The (M)&#8208;rich helix was subsequently transformed into the thermodynamically stable (P)&#8208;rich form in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane with the half&#8208;life time (t1/2) of approximately 44 days at 25 &#186;C. Reduction of the doubly stapled peptide with tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran/water (10/1, v/v) produced the corresponding singly stapled dynamic &#945;&#8208;helical peptide bearing two thiol groups at the side chains, which underwent solvent&#8208;induced reversible helicity inversion. The resulting dithiol of the singly stapled peptide could be reoxidized to form the original doubly stapled form using 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine. Furthermore, the P/M interconversion of a doubly stapled peptide with two flexible hydrocarbon&#8208;based staples is considerably more rapid than that with more rigid staples.</dc:description>

The resulting dithiol of the singly stapled peptide could be reoxidized to form the original doubly stapled form using 4,4&#8217;-dithiodipyridine. Furthermore, the P/M interconversion of a doubly stapled peptide with two flexible hydrocarbon-based staples is considerably more rapid than that with more rigid staples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System based on Supramolecular AIEgen Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthesis is a complex multi&#8208;step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the efficiency of solar energy utilization. In order to improve the utilization of sunlight, researchers have developed a variety of artificial light&#8208;harvesting system to simulate photosynthesis in nature. Here, we report a supramolecular self&#8208;assembly artificial light&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution.&#160; We modified &#946;&#8208;CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation&#8208;induced emission effects (AIE). By using fluorescent molecules with AIE, the self&#8208;quenching effect caused by aggregation in aqueous solution can be effectively avoided. Due to the host&#8208;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD and adamantane, nanoparticles with stable structure and uniform size can be spontaneously assembled in water. Because of the close distance and strong spectral overlap between naphthalimide and tetraphenylethylene, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was realized, and artificial light&#8208;harvesting system was successfully constructed in aqueous solution. The light&#8208;harvesting system has a high energy transfer efficiency (&#934;ET). Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for constructing artificial light&#8208;harvesting system.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Masked Organic Sulfates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature offers a variety of structurally unique, sulfated endobiotics including sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines. Sulfated molecules display a large number of biological activities including antithrombotic, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and others, which arise from modulation of intracellular signaling and enhanced in vivo retention of certain hormones. These characteristics position sulfated molecules very favorably as drug&#8208;like agents. However, few have reached the clinic. Major hurdles exist in realizing sulfated molecules as drugs. This state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art has been transformed through recent works on the development of sulfate masking technologies for both alkyl (sulfated carbohydrates, sulfated steroids) and aryl (sTyr&#8208;bearing peptides/proteins, sulfated flavonoids) sulfates. This review compiles the literature on different strategies implemented for different types of sulfate groups. Starting from early efforts in protection of sulfate groups to the design of newer SuFEx, trichloroethyl, and gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;based protection technologies, this review presents the evolution and application of concepts in realizing highly diverse, sulfated molecules as candidate drugs and/or prodrugs. Overall, the newer strategies for sulfate masking and demasking are likely to greatly enhance the design and development of sulfated molecules as non&#8208;toxic drugs of the future.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Selective Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Glycosyl Phosphate Repeating Structure via the Phosphoramidite Method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) are found on the surface of Leishmania, a protozoan parasite, and are immunologically important. Herein, disaccharide 1&#8208;phosphate repeating units of LPGs were successfully synthesized on a solid support with high anomeric purity using a disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite building block. To enhance solubility in the reaction solvent, hydroxy&#8208;protecting groups in the form of para&#8208;t&#8208;butylbenzoyl were introduced to the building block. The saccharide chain was elongated via stable glycosyl boranophosphate linkages, followed by the conversion of inter&#8208;sugar linkages to phosphodiester counterparts using an oxaziridine derivative. The addition of a silylating reagent post&#8208;reaction with the oxaziridine derivative efficiently facilitated the conversion of boranophosohodiesters to phosphodiesters. This method enabled the &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of up to 15 repeating units, marking the longest homogeneous repeating units of LPGs &#160;synthesized chemically.&#160; Given the chain length equivalence to native LPGs, the method developed herein holds promise for advancing anti&#8208;Leishmanial pharmaceuticals and vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition State Stabilizing Effects of Oxygen and Sulfur Chalcogen Bond Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bond (ChB) interactions have found utility in many fields, including catalysis, organic semiconductors, and crystal engineering. In this study, the kinetic effects of ChB interactions of oxygen and sulfur were experimentally measured using a series of molecular rotors. The rotors were designed to form ChB interactions in the bond rotation transition states. This enabled their kinetic influences to be assessed by monitoring changes in rotational barriers. Despite forming weaker ChB interactions, the smaller chalcogens were able to stabilize transition states and had measurable kinetic effects. Sulfur stabilized the bond rotation transition state by as much as &#8208;7.2 kcal/mol without electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The key was to design a system where the sulfur&#160;&#120590;&#8208;hole was aligned with the lone pairs of the chalcogen bond acceptor. Oxygen rotors also could form transition state stabilizing ChB interactions but required electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For both oxygen and sulfur ChB interactions, a strong correlation was observed between transition state stabilizing abilities and electrostatic potential (ESP) of the chalcogen, providing a useful predictive parameter for the rational design of future ChB systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade C&#8722;H Activation and Two C&#8722;C Bond Forming in Reaction of Azalutetacyclopentadiene with 2&#8208;Methylbenzonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azametallacyclopentadienes are an important class of metallacycles as the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted or catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reaction of nitriles and alkynes. Rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes have shown unique reactivity toward benzonitriles. The reaction chemistry of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles has been investigated in this work, showing different reactivity. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction selectively initiates with the remote activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond by the Lu&#8722;N bond, followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the deprotonated benzylic carbon to form a C&#8722;C bond. Subsequently, the high ring strain promoted the generation of the uncoordinated carbanion dissociated from the lutetium center, which then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack toward C&#8801;N triple bond to give the final product containing fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle. This work not only achieves highly selective three&#8208;step cascade transformation to form a unique class of rare&#8208;earth metallacycle, but also reveals a novel reaction pattern of unsaturated substrates with C&#8722;H bonds that can be activated.</dc:description>

         <title>Phthalocyanines Synthesis: A State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Review of Sustainable Approaches Through Green Chemistry Metrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide an overview of the synthetic methodologies with reduced environmental impact developed over the last 25&#8197;years for phthalocyanine synthesis, relating them to the Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor), a key metric in green chemistry that allows for a rapid, effective, and versatile evaluation of the quantity of waste produced relative to the product obtained.







Abstract
Driven by escalating environmental concerns, synthetic chemistry faces an urgent need for a green revolution. Green chemistry, with its focus on low environmental impacting chemicals and minimized waste production, emerges as a powerful tool in addressing this challenge. Metrics such as the E&#8208;factor guide the design of environmentally friendly strategies for chemical processes by quantifying the waste generated in obtaining target products, thus enabling interventions to minimize it. Phthalocyanines (Pcs), versatile molecules with exceptional physical and chemical properties, hold immense potential for technological applications. This review aims to bridge the gap between green chemistry and phthalocyanine synthesis by collecting the main examples of environmentally sustainable syntheses documented in the literature. The calculation of the E&#8208;factor of a selection of them provides insights on how crucial it is to evaluate a synthetic process in its entirety. This approach allows for a better evaluation of the actual sustainability of the phthalocyanine synthetic process and indicates possible strategies to improve it.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Oxygenative Rearrangement of Tetrahydrocarbazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed tunable oxygenative rearrangement reaction of tetrahydrocarbazoles by using H2O and O2 as oxygen source has been developed. Accordingly, highly important yet synthetically difficult cyclopentyl&#8208;bearing spiroindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and spiroindolin&#8208;3&#8208;one products were obtained with excellent chemoselectivity and regioselectivity. Inspired from the unique pathway of 1, 2&#8208;migration rearrangement, a highly controllable hydroxylation of indoles for the construction of C3a&#8208;hydroxyl iminium indolines was also developed.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the tunable oxygenative rearrangement of tetrahydrocarbazoles to cyclopentyl&#8208;bearing spiroindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and spiroindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The method demonstrates excellent chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and product control simply by using the H2O and O2 as oxygen source, respectively. This open&#8208;flask method is safe and simple to operate, and no other chemical oxidants are required. Besides, inspired from the unique pathway of 1, 2&#8208;migration rearrangement, a highly controllable hydroxylation of indoles for the construction of C3a&#8208;hydroxyl iminium indolines was also developed. Mechanistic experiments suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;induced oxidation process is responsible for the tunable selectivity control.

         <title>Multiple Pathways in the Triplet States Population for a Naphthalenediimide&#8208;C60 Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoexcitation of the antenna (NDI) in the NDI&#8208;C60 dyad, either intramolecular singlet state energy transfer (FRET) or charge separation (CS)/charge recombination (CR) occurs, depending on the solvent polarity. The ultrafast photophysics of the dyad was studied by using nanosecond/femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and the electron spin dynamics was studied by using TREPR spectroscopy







Abstract
The link of an antenna dye with an electron spin converter, in this case naphthalenediimide and C60, produces a system with a rich photophysics including the detection of more than one triplet state on the long timescale (tens of &#956;s). Beside the use of optical spectroscopies in the ns and in the fs time scale, we used time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (TREPR) to study the system evolution following photoexcitation. TREPR keeps track of the formation path of the triplet states through specific spin polarization patterns observed in the spectra. The flexibility of the linker and solvent polarity play a role in favouring either electron transfer or energy transfer processes.

         <title>Fabrication of Fe/KB Composite as Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe/KB composites with the structure of Fe nano particles embedded in KB is used as a sulfur host for Li&#8722;S battery. KB matrix has good absorption ability and high conductivity while Fe nano particles show excellent catalytic effect on lithium polysulfides. Therefore the Li&#8722;S battery using Fe/KB/S cathode shows high discharge capacity and stable cycle stability.







Abstract
Lithium sulfur battery is a novel kind of secondary battery which has high energy density, however its application is greatly affected by the shuttle effect of polysulfides generated in the redox reaction of cathode electrode. Metal active sites are supposed as effective catalysts which can absorb and accelerate the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides, thus the shuttle effect will be alleviated. In this work, we conducted a simple way to prepare a metal Fe doped ketjen black to serve as the sulfur host of lithium sulfur battery. Ketjen black has a large specific surface area and rich porous structure, while Fe nanodot is an excellent catalyst for lithium polysulfides. Because of these advantages, the Fe/KB host can effectively confine a large amount of active material and accelerate its, therefore the Fe/KB&#8722;S cathode electrode show an excellent electrochemical performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dihydrobenzofurans, Dihydrobenzosulfones, and Dihydroindoles by Merging One&#8208;pot Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Matsuda Reactions from Anilines with Redox&#8208;Relay Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot tandem protocol is reported for the enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran, dihydroindole, and dihydrobenzosulfone scaffolds by a Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction under open&#8208;flask conditions with in situ generation of aryldiazonium salt directly from anilines. The enantioenriched heterocycles are synthesized in overall yields up to 78&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by a sequential 5&#8208;step protocol.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot tandem process was developed aiming at the concise and expeditious enantioselective synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran, dihydrobenzosulfone, and dihydroindole scaffolds under mild, and open&#8208;flask conditions. This process combines the in&#8197;situ generation of aryldiazonium salt directly from the anilines in methanol telescoped to an intramolecular Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction linked to a redox relay process to provide the final products as the dimethyl acetals. These Heck products were smoothly converted into the corresponding primary alcohols or esters. The robustness and the efficiency of the protocol are demonstrated by the synthesis of 24 enantioenriched dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrobenzosulfones, and dihydroindoles in overall yields up to 78&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by a sequential 5&#8208;step protocol.

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Visible Light&#8208;Induced C(sp2)&#8722;H Arylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and Coumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have disclosed a method for obtaining 3&#8208;aryl heterocycles with good yield and excellent regioselectivity without the need for additional photosensitizers or strong oxidants, and have successfully synthesized bioactive compounds using this method. Computational investigations at the CASPT2//CASSC F/PCM level of theory revealed that a single electron transfer has occurred between the excited state of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one and iodonium ylide.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a visible light&#8208;induced C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation method for quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and coumarins using iodonium ylides without the need for external photocatalysts. The protocol demonstrates a broad substrate scope, enabling the arylation of diverse heterocycles through a simple and mild procedure. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction showcases its applicability in the efficient synthesis of biologically active molecules. Computational investigations at the CASPT2//CASSCF/PCM level of theory revealed that the excited state of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one facilitates electron transfer from its &#960; bond to the antibonding orbital of the C&#8722;I bond in the iodonium ylide, ultimately leading to the formation of an aryl radical, which subsequently participates in the C&#8722;H arylation process. In addition, our calculations reveal that during the single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, the C&#8722;I bond cleavage in iodonium ylide and new C&#8722;C bond formation between resultant aryl radical and cationic quinoxaline species take place in a concerned manner. This enables the arylation reaction to efficiently proceed along an energy&#8208;efficient route.

         <title>Plenty of Space in the Backbone: Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last decade has revitalized radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP), with a primary focus on inserting hydrolytic targets into the otherwise non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone obtained from radical polymerization. This review covers critical developments over the past three years that enable polymer architectures which are not only hydrolytically degradable but also comprise complex chemical main chain architectures.







Abstract
Radical polymerization is the most widely applied technique in both industry and fundamental science. However, its major drawback is that it typically yields polymers with non&#8208;functional, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbones&#8212;a limitation that radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP) allows to overcome. The last decade has seen a surge in rROP, primarily focused on creating degradable polymers. This pursuit has resulted in the creation of the first readily degradable materials through radical polymerization. Recent years have witnessed innovations in new monomers that address previous design limitations, such as ring strain and reactivity ratios. Furthermore, advances in integrating rROP with reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) have facilitated the incorporation of complex, customizable chemical payloads into the main polymer chain. This short review discusses the latest developments in monomer design with a focused analysis of their limitations in a broader historical context. Recently evolving strategies for compatibility of rROP monomers with RDRP are discussed, which are key to precision polymer synthesis. The latest chemistry surveyed expands the horizon beyond mere hydrolytic degradation. Now is the time to explore the chemical potential residing in the previously inaccessible polymer backbone.

         <title>Nitrophenol Reduction with Silver Oxide Nanostructures as a Sustainable Approach to Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol to 4&#8208;aminophenol, almost complete conversion is achieved within 12&#8197;minutes using green synthesized Ag2O nanostructures as the catalyst. The kinetics follows pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics. The findings (kapp=4.24&#215;10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1) highlight the catalyst as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for treating recalcitrant nitroarenes.







Abstract
We propose silver oxide as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for the catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics. In the present investigation, we adopt a facile and green synthetic route for the synthesis of silver oxide nanostructures. The prepared nanostructures were found to crystallize in the cuprite phase and exhibit absorbance across the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The catalytic potential of the silver oxide was evaluated by following the kinetics of nitrophenol reduction under ambient conditions and is observed to follow pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant 

kapp=4.24&#215;10-3

 ${{k}_{app}=4.24\ \times {10}^{-3}}$



 s&#8722;1 at minimum concentration of the catalyst. We attribute the observed catalytic activity to the freshly generated catalytic surface featuring a partially reduced form of silver oxide during reaction. The findings highlight the efficacy of silver oxide in mitigating the environmental pollution originating from the recalcitrant nitroarenes.

         <title>Under the Influence of Water: Molecular Recognition of Organic Hydrophilic Molecules in Water with a Prismarene Host Driven by Hydration Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble deep cavity prism[5]arene host has the ability to form endo&#8208;cavity complexes with neutral organic and hydrophilic substances in aqueous medium. The stability of these complexes in aqueous environments is largely influenced by water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interactions between the host and guest molecules, as well as the expulsion of frustrated water molecules from the deep cavity of the prism[5]arene.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arene host can form endo&#8208;cavity complexes with hydrophilic organic substances in water by displacing frustrated water molecules from its deep cavity. Water molecules structured at both rims of the prismarene host can mediate hydrogen bonding interactions with the guest. Water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interactions were invoked here to elucidate the elevated binding affinities and selectivity of the prismarene host toward hydrophilic organic guests. We show that water at the interface of a host&#8208;guest complex can act as an extension of the host structure, facilitating the accommodation of neutral guests within the binding site. This study highlights the crucial role of water in facilitating supramolecular interactions between a deep&#8208;cavity prismarene host and organic hydrophilic guests in aqueous medium.

         <title>Chiral Diselenophosphoric Acids for Ion Pair Catalysis: A Novel Approach to Enhance Both Proton Donating and Proton Accepting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) obtained with up to 98&#8201;% NMR yield. DSA provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.







Abstract
The activation of poorly reactive substrates via strong chiral acids is a central topic in asymmetric ion pair catalysis these days. Despite highly successful scaffolds such as N&#8208;triflylphosphoramides, these catalysts either lack C2&#8208;symmetry or provide multiple H&#8208;bond acceptor sites, leading to lower ee values for certain reactions. We present BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) as an extremely promising alternative. Using an intertwined approach of synthesis and NMR studies, we developed a synthetic approach to DSA with up to 98&#8201;% NMR yield. The obtained acids provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties, a bifunctionality, which is key to catalytic applications. Indeed, first reactivity test proved the much higher acidity of DSA and its ability to initiate Mukaiyama&#8211;Mannich reaction and protodesilylation of silyl ethers. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Calix[4]arene Framework by Iridium&#8211;Mediated Alkyne Insertion into an Inert C&#8722;C Bond: A Novel Strategy for Unsymmetrical Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic method for unsymmetrical macrocycles was developed by iridium&#8208;mediated alkyne insertion into an inert C(methylene)&#8722;C(aryl) bond of calix[4]arene framework. This post&#8208;synthetic modification can be applied to various terminal alkynes to enable a facile access to unsymmetrical, monofunctionalized macrocycles with unique structures.







Abstract
As a novel synthetic method for unsymmetrical macrocycles, we herein developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification of calix[4]arenes by insertion of a terminal alkyne into an inert C(methylene)&#8722;C(aryl) bond of the macrocyclic framework. In this transformation, C&#8208;iridated calix[4]arenes, readily synthesized through C&#8722;H bond activation of the parent calix[4]arene, undergoes C(methylene)&#8722;C(aryl) bond cleavage followed by insertion of an alkyne to provide a ring&#8208;expanded calix[4]arene complex. Removal of the iridium metal from the resulting complex was readily accomplished by a simple treatment with an acid. The developed sequential method affords novel unsymmetrical, monofunctionalized macrocyclic compounds via 3 steps from the parent calix[4]arene in good yield. The unique unsymmetrical structures of the alkyne&#8211;inserted macrocycles were evaluated by X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses. On the basis of theoretical calculations, we propose a reaction mechanism involving an uncommon C&#8722;C bond cleavage step through &#948;&#8208;carbon elimination for the ring enlargement process.

         <title>Exploiting Hydrophobic Amino Acid Scanning to Develop Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need for novel antivirals extends beyond managing current COVID&#8208;19 infections to preparing for future zoonotic outbreaks. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) is essential for viral replication and a validated antiviral target. Through optimization of a peptide inhibitor identified via mRNA display, a cyclic peptide with enhanced cell permeability and antiviral activity was developed.







Abstract
The development of novel antivirals is crucial not only for managing current COVID&#8208;19 infections but for addressing potential future zoonotic outbreaks. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) is vital for viral replication and viability and therefore serves as an attractive target for antiviral intervention. Herein, we report the optimization of a cyclic peptide inhibitor that emerged from an mRNA display selection against the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro to enhance its cell permeability and in&#8197;vitro antiviral activity. By identifying mutation&#8208;tolerant amino acid residues within the peptide sequence, we describe the development of a second&#8208;generation Mpro inhibitor bearing five cyclohexylalanine residues. This cyclic peptide analogue exhibited significantly improved cell permeability and antiviral activity compared to the parent peptide. This approach highlights the importance of optimizing cyclic peptide hits for activity against intracellular targets such as the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro.

         <title>Improving Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance of High&#8208;Density Polyethylene Grades by Comonomer Addition and Nanocomposite Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aim is to determine the effect of polymer density, correlated to the comonomer content, and nanosilica addition on the mechanical and Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR) characteristics of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE). In this regard, five HDPE samples with similar Melt Flow Index (MFI) and molar mass but various densities were acquired from a petrochemical plant. Two polymerization reactors work in series and differ only in the amount of 1&#8208;buene comonomer fed to the second reactor. To ascertain the microstructure of the studied samples, GPC and SSA (successive self&#8208;nucleation and annealing) analyses were accomplished. All samples resulted having similar characteristics but slightly various SCB/1000C=7.26&#8208;9.74 (SCB=Short Chain Branching). Consequently, meanwhile studied HDPEs reveal similar notched impact and stress at yield values, the tensile modulus, stress&#8208;at&#8208;break, and elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break tend to demonstrate different results with the SCB content. More significantly, ESCR characteristic varied considerably with SCB/1000C extent, so that higher amount of SCB acknowledged advanced ESCR. Notably, blending HDPE sample containing higher amount of SCB/1000C, with 3 wt.% of chemically modified nanosilica enhanced ESCR characteristic by 40%. DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations unveiled the role of the comonomer, quantitatively by binding energies and qualitatively by Non Covalent Interaction (NCI) plots.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis by 21&#8208;Thiaporphyrins: A Green and Efficient Approach for C&#8722;N Borylation and C&#8722;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines is reported using 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins. The method is versatile and a series of heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters are prepared in decent yields (up to 88&#8201;%) with only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light. DFT studies suggest that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin donates electron to the substrate and undergo oxidative quenching pathway during the reaction.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis provides a green and sustainable alternative for C&#8722;H activation of organic molecules that eludes harsh conditions and use of transition metals. The photocatalytic C&#8722;N borylation and C&#8722;H arylation mostly depend on the ruthenium and iridium complexes or eosin Y and the use of porphyrin catalysts is still in infancy. A series of novel 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins (A2B2 and A3B type) were synthesized having carbazole/phenothiazine moieties at their meso&#8208;positions and screened as catalysts for C&#8722;N borylation and C&#8722;H arylation. This paper demonstrates the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyzed C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation reactions. A variety of substituted anilines were used as source for expensive and unstable aryl diazonium salts in the reactions. The heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters were obtained in decent yields (up to 88&#8197;%). Versatility of the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst was tested by thiolation and selenylation of anilines under similar conditions. Mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT studies, suggesting that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin undergo an oxidative quenching pathway. The photoredox process catalyzed by 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins offers a mild, efficient and metal&#8208;free alternative for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;Se bonds in aryl compounds; it can also be extended to borylation reaction.

This paper demonstrates the 21-thiaporphyrin catalyzed C&#8722;N borylation and het-arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21-thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C&#8722;N borylation and het-arylation reactions. A variety of substituted anilines were used as source for expensive and unstable aryl diazonium salts in the reactions. The heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters were obtained in decent yields (up to 88&#8197;%). Versatility of the 21-thiaporphyrin catalyst was tested by thiolation and selenylation of anilines under similar conditions. Mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT studies, suggesting that 21-thiaporphyrin undergo an oxidative quenching pathway. The photoredox process catalyzed by 21-thiaporphyrins offers a mild, efficient and metal-free alternative for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;Se bonds in aryl compounds; it can also be extended to borylation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Behaviors of Isostructural Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Naphthalene, Quinoxaline, and Pyrazinopyrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks based on naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores, have been constructed. Upon removal of guest molecules, these three solvated HOFs underwent transformations through rearrangement of hydrogen bonds. Each transformed structure possesses different intermolecular interactions contributed from atom in the molecular core.







Abstract
A series of isostructural reticular frameworks with systematic differences on chemical structures allows us to disclose correlations between specific structural factors and properties, providing insights for designing novel porous materials. However, even slight differences in the molecular structure often lead to non&#8208;isostructural polymorphic frameworks particularly in the case of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) because the structures of HOFs are based on a subtle balance of reversible interactions. In this study, we found that three simple analogues of tetracarboxylic acids with naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores (NT, QX, and PP, respectively) yielded isostructural solvated HOFs (NT&#8208;1, QX&#8208;1, and PP&#8208;1, respectively), where hydrogen&#8208;bonded sql&#8208;networked sheets were slip&#8208;stacked with closely similar manners. More importantly, these isostructural HOFs underwent structural transformations in different manners upon removal of the guest solvents. Comparison of the crystal structures of the HOFs before and after the transformation revealed that intermolecular interactions of the core significantly affected on rearrangements of hydrogen bonds in the transformation. The results suggest the potential to control the properties and functions of isostructural HOFs by elements in the core.

         <title>Exploiting Nitroreductases for the Tailored Photoenzymatic Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have a broad range of applications and their selective synthesis is very appealing for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Herein we report the usage of the flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductase BaNTR1 for the photoenzymatic synthesis of various anthranils and quinolines from retro&#8208;synthetically designed o&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted carbonyl substrates, achieving high conversions (up to &gt;99%) and good product yields (up to 96%). Whereas the effective production of anthranils required the inclusion of H2O2 in the reaction mixtures to accumulate the needed hydroxylamine intermediates, the formation of quinolines required the use of anaerobic or reducing conditions to efficiently generate the essential amine intermediates. Critical to our success was the high chemoselectivity of BaNTR1, performing selective reduction of the nitro group without reduction of the carbonyl moiety or the activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. The results highlight the usefulness of an innocuous chlorophyll&#8208; and nitroreductase&#8208;based photoenzymatic system for the tailored synthesis of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles from simple nitro compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Organic Photosensitizers Based on 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminophenyl)benzothiazoles for Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)benzothiazole and related derivatives for their photophysical properties in view of employing them as new and readily tunable organic photocatalysts. Their triplet energies were estimated by DFT calculations to be in the range of 52&#8208;57 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1 suggesting their suitability for the [2+2] photocycloaddition of unsaturated acyl imidazoles with styrene derivatives. Experimental studies have shown that 2&#8209;(2&#8209;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles comprising alkylamino groups (NHMe, NHiPr) or the native amino group provide the best photocatalytic results in these visible&#8208;light mediated [2+2] reactions without the need of any additives yielding a range of cyclobutane derivatives. A combined experimental and theoretical approach has provided insights into the underlying triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer process.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Fluorenyl&#8208;Based Copolyimines with Adjustable Mechanical Properties, Recyclability and Friction Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and evaluation of Cardo&#8208;DPIs films have been successfully completed. The presence of the fluorenyl effect, along with ether linkages and a high cross&#8208;linking density of dynamic polyimines, has resulted in films that not only demonstrated superior mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing capabilities but also enabled closed&#8208;loop recycling. Furthermore, the friction and wear characteristics of Cardo&#8208;DPIs have been systematically analyzed.







Abstract
Dynamic polyimines are a class of fascinating dynamic polymers with recyclability and reparability owing to their reversible Schiff&#8208;base reactions. However, balancing the dynamic properties and mechanical strength of dynamic polyimines presents a major challenge due to the dissociative and associative nature of the imine bonds. Herein, we introduced bulky fluorene groups and polyether amine into the skeleton of polyimine networks to achieve a tradeoff in comprehensive properties. The resulting dynamic polyimines with fluorene groups (Cardo&#8208;DPIs) were successfully synthesized by combining the rigid diamine 9,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)fluorene and the flexible polyether amine, demonstrating a high tensile strength of 64.7&#8197;MPa. Additionally, Cardo&#8208;DPIs films with more content of rigid fluorene groups exhibited higher water resistance, glass transition temperature and wear&#8208;resisting ability. Moreover, the Cardo&#8208;DPIs films not only efficiently underwent thermal reshaping, but also exhibited excellent self&#8208;healing capabilities and chemical degradation in acidic solutions. Furthermore, the resulting films can achieve fully closed&#8208;loop recovery by free amine solution for 2&#8197;h at room temperature. This study broadens the scope of dynamic polyimine materials and promotes the balanced development of their functional and mechanical properties.

         <title>The Structure of Carbon Dioxide at the Air&#8208;Water Interface and its Chemical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to first&#8208;principles simulations, the ability of carbon dioxide to capture an electron at the air&#8208;water interface should be larger than in bulk solution, which opens interesting perspectives for developing more efficient reduction processes.







Abstract
The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggest that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Metal&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Multicomponent Radical Sulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of radical sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation) under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent systems, along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Vinyl sulfones are crucial building blocks in synthetic chemistry and core structural units of pharmaceutically active molecules, thus extensive investigations have been conducted on the construction of these skeletons. In contrast to the classical synthetic approaches, the radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Radical sulfonation of alkynes typically begins with the sulfonyl radical attacking the alkynes, followed by further functionalization. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. However, there is no comprehensive review summarizing the advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation), along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Recyclable Homogeneous Catalysis Enabled by Dynamic Coordination on Rhodium(II) Axial Sites of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;synthetic coordinative functionalization of Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) is employed to engineer homogeneous catalysts for styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions. This dynamic coordinative functionalization does not hinder the catalytic activity of the Rh(II) sites and it can be coupled to ligand&#8208;exchange reactions to precipitate the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating its recovery and reuse.







Abstract
The activity of catalytic nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their surface chemistry, which controls colloidal stability and substrate diffusion toward catalytic sites. In this work, we studied how the outer surface chemistry of nanostructured Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) impacts their performance in homogeneous catalysis. Specifically, through post&#8208;synthetic coordination of aliphatic imidazole ligands onto the exohedral Rh(II) axial sites of Rh&#8208;MOPs, we solubilized a cuboctahedral Rh&#8208;MOP in dichloromethane, thereby enabling its use as a homogeneous catalyst. We demonstrated that the presence of the coordinating ligand on the surface of the Rh&#8208;MOP does not hinder its catalytic activity in styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions, thanks to the dynamic Rh&#8208;imidazole coordination bond. Finally, we used similar ligand exchange post&#8208;synthetic reactions to develop a ligand&#8208;mediated approach for precipitating the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating the recovery and reuse of Rh&#8208;MOPs as homogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linking Networks as Durable Bifunctional Coating for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional AT network coating on Zn anode has been constructed via the reversible dynamic cross&#8208;linking interactions, which not only acts as a solid isolation layer to hinder H2O&#8208;induced side reactions but also induces Zn2+ ion flux and lastingly suppresses the Zn dendrites. As a result, the symmetric cell can maintain a significantly prolonged cycle life of 1087&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The serious dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross&#8208;linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross&#8208;linking, AT network coating is endowed with self&#8208;healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087&#8197;h at large charge/discharge depths of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.

Abstract
Developing pragmatic strategies for accessing functional benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzofuran remains an enduring challenge. Herein, we have achieved a highly discriminating electrochemical oxidative dearomative spiroannulation of 3&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzofuran, culminating in the synthesis of 2H&#8208;spiro[benzofuran&#8208;3,9&#8242;&#8208;fluoren]&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. By harnessing the electrophilic intermediates of benzofuryl radical cations supported by DFT calculations, we attain exceptional regioselectivity while eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants. Mechanistic investigations reveal a sequence of events involving the benzofuran radical cation, encompassing the capture of H2O, nucleophilic arene attack, and subsequent deprotonation, ultimately yielding the final benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

Herein, we have achieved a highly discriminating electrochemical oxidative dearomative spiroannulation of 3-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-2-yl)benzofuran, culminating in the synthesis of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-spiro[benzofuran-3,9&#8242;-fluoren]-2-one derivatives. By harnessing the electrophilic intermediates of benzofuryl radical cations supported by DFT calculations, we attain exceptional regioselectivity while eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants. Mechanistic investigations reveal a sequence of events involving the benzofuran radical cation, encompassing the capture of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, nucleophilic arene attack, and subsequent deprotonation, ultimately yielding the final benzofuran-2-ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>peri&#8208;Benzo&#8208;Diindenotetracenyl: Helically &#960;&#8208;Extended Allyl Radical with Robust Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, is described. The helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents but shows high stability. According to the XRD and theoretical studies, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD| of 2.4&#215;10&#8722;4. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K.







Abstract
Here is described the synthesis and characterization of a stable hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, with a helical structure. Although the helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents, it was stable in the solid and solutions. According to the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD| of 2.4&#215;10&#8722;4 at 522&#8197;nm. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K, which is compatible with that of [5]helicene (108&#8197;kJ/mol).

         <title>Synthesis of Asymmetric Ionic Hybrid Detergents enables Micelles with Scalable Properties including Cell Compatibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric modularity is the new kid on the block that drives the diversification of the detergentome. Modular ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents deliver a new chemical space and design modalities to switch ionic detergent species toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies.







Abstract
Ionic detergents enable applications and cause harm in biospheres due to cell toxicity. The utility of covalent combinations between ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergent headgroups in modulating cell toxicity remains speculative due to the yet rarely explored synthesis. We close this gap and establish the modular synthesis of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. We restructure a combinatorial methallyl dichloride one&#8208;pot coupling into a two&#8208;step coupling, which reduces by&#8208;products, improves product yields, and enables the gram&#8208;scale preparation of asymmetric, cationic/non&#8208;ionic and anionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. Our modular synthesis delivers new modalities for the design of ionic detergents, including an unprecedented scaling of properties that determine applications, such as charge, critical micelle concentration, solubilizing properties, hard water tolerance, and cell compatibility. We uncover that shielding the charge in ionic headgroups can switch the detergent species that is toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies. Establishing the chemistry of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents provides a missing evolutionary link in the structural comparison of ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergents, enables an easy synthesis access to yet unexplored chemical spaces of asymmetric hybrid materials, and delivers new modalities for designing the toxicity of supramolecular nanomaterials.

         <title>Asymmetric Kinetic Resolution Polymerization of Racemic Lactide Mediated by Axial&#8208;Chiral Thiourea/Phosphazene Binary Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great challenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186 &#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Topological Supramolecular Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The dynamic or reversible nature of SPs endows them unique physical and chemical properties, such as self&#8208;adaptive and stimuli&#8208;response abilities. The topological structures of SPs play an important role in determining the physicochemical properties and functionality. Hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) are highly branched 3D macromolecules with linear, dendritic, and terminal units, which makes them versatile candidates for the construction of SPs with fascinating architectures.  The resultant HBP&#8208;based SPs perfectly integrated the dynamic/reversible nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. To date, various types of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies have been constructed, and their potential applications have been explored as well. This article overviews the current progress on self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs. The strategies for construction of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies are discussed. Typical potential applications of the assemblies of HBP&#8208;based SPs are also introduced.</dc:description>
