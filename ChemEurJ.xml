         <title>Rapid Unambiguous Structure Elucidation of Streptnatamide A, a New Cyclic Peptide Isolated from A Marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides have been excellent source of drug leads. With the advances in discovery platforms, the pharmaceutical industry has a growing interest in cyclic peptides and has pushed several into clinical trials. However, structural complexity of cyclic peptides brings extreme challenges for structure elucidation efforts. Isotopic fine structure analysis, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and detailed tandem mass spectrometry rapidly provided peptide sequence for streptnatamide A, a cyclic peptide isolated from a marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. Marfey&#8217;s analysis determined the stereochemistry of all amino acids, enabling the unambiguous structure determination of this compound. A non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in&#8208;silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Luminescent Dyes: From Theoretical Insight to Experimental Evidence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To ESPT, or not to ESPT. The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes' shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;mediated photocatalytic chlorine production over bismuth oxychloride in chloride solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8208;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine using solar energy and&#160;NaCl solution&#160;offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, we found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 to 39.6 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare C q (C q )4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000 &#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bonds in Hydroxymethylfurfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C&#8211;C bonds in organic molecules is a powerful tool for the synthesis of value&#8208;added compounds. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) derivatives are a promising class of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals that have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and materials. However, the selective activation of unstrained C&#8211;C bonds is a challenging task, mainly due to their relatively high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed method for the efficient C&#8211;C bond activation of HMF derivatives, enabling their arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies, including reaction&#8208;profile analysis, competition experiments and head&#8208;space IR&#8208;spectroscopy suggest a decarboxylative mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of Maneb: An important manganese&#8208;containing bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maneb is a manganese(II) containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is however mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Synthetic Approach to Highly Reactive Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linkers
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular iodolactonization was employed for the efficient and stereoselective conversion of an sTCO click&#8208;conjugation precursor to a highly reactive and stable click&#8208;cleavable sTCO antibody conjugate linker.







Abstract
An increase in the click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction rate between cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and tetrazines would be beneficial for drug delivery applications. In this work, we have developed a short and stereoselective synthesis route towards highly reactive sTCOs that serve as cleavable linkers, affording quantitative tetrazine&#8208;triggered payload release. In addition, the fivefold more reactive sTCO exhibited the same in&#8197;vivo stability as current TCO linkers when used as antibody linkers in circulation in mice.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta) &lt; &#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91 &#215; 10&#8208;2 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) under 100 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes: Dual Reagents for the Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;boranes are demonstrated to be efficient dual reagents, as both reducing agent and source of surface ligands, for the synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. This strategy allows the synthesis of spherical and monodisperse AuNPs of variable sizes by adjusting the gold to NHC&#8208;borane ratio. The NHC&#8208;boranes can also be exploited in a seeded growth process, a strategy never before reported with NHC stabilized gold nanoparticles. The protocol is simple, operates under mild conditions and avoids the use of extensive purification methods.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nanomaterials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling the formation of strong and covalent carbon&#8211;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists of the reduction of a preformed NHC&#8208;AuI complex with a large excess of a reducing agent that makes the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report the straightforward synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (NHC&#8208;AuNPs) by treating a commercially available gold(I) precursor with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize NHC&#8208;BH3 reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC&#8208;BH2Cl as a by&#8208;product. This strategy gives efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC&#8208;borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation over the range of 4.9&#177;0.9 to 10.0&#177;2.7&#8197;nm. Our strategy also allows an unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as&#8208;prepared NHC&#8208;AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without the need for extensive purification or size&#8208;selectivity techniques, and are stable over months.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been synthetized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we keep fixed the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as coreactant and coreactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceed the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 up to 28 times with benzoyl peroxide and 38 times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield or excited state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depend on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, enabling practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution enables the assembly of rhodols and novel strongly emitting merocyanines from simple substrates.







Abstract
A new, transformative method for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings, and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties, such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.&#8201;e. 4800&#8197;cm&#8722;1, brightness approximately 80.000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150&#8197;GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and new merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.

A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and new merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two-photon absorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect Inside a Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective inner&#8208;space modification was achieved by the encapsulation of a CH3CN. The polarity of the resulting molecular complex was enhanced, with a decreased LUMO level. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD3CN compared with CH3CN was revealed.







Abstract
Despite several small molecules being encapsulated inside cage&#8208;opened fullerene derivatives, such species have not considerably affected the structures and properties of the outer carbon cages. Herein, we achieved an effective inner&#8208;space modification for an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative by insertion of a neutral CH3CN molecule into the cavity. The CH3CN@open&#8208;C60 thus obtained showed an enhanced polarity, thus affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without the preparative HPLC that was needed for previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and theoretical calculations revealed that both the presence of the encapsulated CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the CH3CN play an essential role in the change of the electronic properties. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD3CN with internal C60 surface is discussed.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Star Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly for Rapid Fabrication of Nanoparticles with High Encapsulation Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer results in nanoparticles with narrow&#8208;size distribution and capability of high hydrophobic cargo encapsulation up to 19.84&#8201;%. A kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism has been proposed for this process.







Abstract
Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer, (polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyethylene glycol)21 [(PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21] in aqueous solution has been performed by reverse solvent exchange procedure. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) reveal the formation of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Further investigation indicates a kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism of the copolymers, in which the star topology of the amphiphilic copolymer and deep quenching condition by reverse solvent exchange are key to accelerate intrachain contraction of the copolymer during phase separation. When interchain contraction dominant over interchain association, nanoparticles with low aggregation number could be formed. Thanks to the high hydrophobic contents of the (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21 polymers, the resulted nanoparticles could encapsulate a high capacity of hydrophobic cargo up to 19.84&#8201;%. The kinetically controlled star copolymer self&#8208;assembly process reported here provides a platform for the rapid and scalable fabrication of nanoparticle with high drug loading capacity (LC), which may find broad range of applications in, for example drug delivery, nanopesticide.

         <title>The Bulk Breast Cancer Cell and Breast Cancer Stem Cell Activity of Binuclear Copper(II)&#8208;Phenanthroline Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations of the anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of multinuclear metal complexes are rare. Here the synthesis, characterisation, and bulk breast cancer cell and breast CSC activity of two new binuclear copper(II) complexes are reported. The mechanism of action of the most stable and potent binuclear copper(II) complex were elucidated.







Abstract
Mononuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes have been widely investigated as anticancer agents whereas multinuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes are underexplored. Here the synthesis and characterisation of two new binuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes 1 and 2 is reported, comprising of 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline or 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, terminal chloride ligands, and bridging chloride or hydroxide ligands. The binuclear copper(II) complex containing 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline 1 displays nanomolar toxicity towards bulk breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) grown in monolayers, &gt;50&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin (an anticancer metallodrug) and salinomycin (a gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;CSC agent). Spectacularly, 1 exhibits &gt;100&#8208;fold greater potency toward three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres than cisplatin and salinomycin. Mechanistic studies show that 1 evokes breast CSC apoptosis by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and damaging genomic DNA (possibly by an oxidative mechanism). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to probe the anti&#8208;breast CSC properties of binuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economic catalytic method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters was achieved to provide enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;allyl amino esters with high yields and high enantioselectivities. To achieve this transformation, we utilized a ternary catalytic system consisting of a chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;palladium complex, an achiral picolinaldehyde, and the Lewis acid Zn(OTf)2.







Abstract
Reported in this work is a synergistic ternary achiral picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;chiral palladium complex system for the highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters. By utilizing a variety of allylic carbonates or vinyl benzoxazinanones as substrates, &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Control experiments suggest that the coordination of Zn(II) with the Schiff base intermediate enhances the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of amino esters, thereby favoring &#945;&#8208;allylation over intrinsic N&#8208;allylation. Furthermore, NMR studies reveal an interaction between the chiral palladium complex and the Zn(II)&#8208;Schiff base intermediate, leading to the formation of a picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;Pd(0) catalytic system.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to rationalization the molecular mechanisms of chirogenesis? Using a sterically hindered porphyrin receptor, we provide a blue print for the comprehensive analysis of induced electronic circular dichroism with experimental and computational methods and identify critical geometric factors and possible problems, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra.







Abstract
The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work, the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexa-cationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non-aromatic peripheral substituents on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Precise Dicationic Tetraboranes: Syntheses, Structures and Rearrangement to an Alkylidene Borate&#8208;Borenium Zwitterion and a 1,3&#8208;Azaborinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes were prepared and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases afford a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species and a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine, respectively. The structural relationship of the alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium zwitterion and its zwitterionic diborene analogue was investigated.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes, featuring an electron&#8208;precise tetraborane chain, were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases give rise to different outcomes according to the conditions employed, including: 1) reduction and rearrangement of the tetraborane chain to give a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species; 2) cleavage of the tetraborane chain to afford a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine; and 3) reduction of the supporting ligands to provide a diamino dipotassium salt. The zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species can be viewed as an analogue of the base&#8208;stabilized diborenes. NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a highly polarized B&#8722;B bond in the zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium, in which the formal oxidation states of the boron atoms can be considered as &#8722;1 and +2. These results suggest the considerable potential of tetraboranes as synthons for low&#8208;valent boron species.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We propose a mechanism for substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups through their hierarchical and asymmetric assembly modes. &#160;&#160;Four asymmetric 7,8,8&#8208;tris(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes with a 7&#8208;positioned ethoxycarbonyl (2a(H)), 2&#8217;&#8208;fluoroethoxycarbonyl (2b(F)), 2&#8217;&#8208;chloroethoxycarbonyl (2c(Cl)), or 2&#8217;&#8208;bromoethoxycarbonyl (2d(Br)) were synthesized and crystallized. &#160;&#160;2a(H), 2b(F) and 2d(Br) afforded only one shape crystal, while 2c(Cl) did two polymorphic 2c(Cl)&#8208;a and 2c(Cl)&#8208;b.&#160;&#160; UV&#8208;irradiation induced topochemical polymerization for 2a(H), no reactions for 2b(F) and 2c(Cl)&#8208;a, and [6+6] photocycloaddition dimerization for 2c(Cl)&#8208;b and 2d(Br). &#160;&#160;Such substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities and crystal structures were compared with those of the known symmetric 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes such as 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1a(Me)&#8208;a and 1a(Me)&#8208;b), 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1b(Et)), and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(bromoethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1c(BrEt)).&#160;&#160; The comparative study clarified that the reactivities and crystal structures are classified into four types that link to each other.&#160;&#160; This linkage is understandable when we analyze the crystal structures through the following hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, 1D&#8208;columns, 2D&#8208;sheets, and 3D&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals).&#160;&#160; This supramolecular viewpoint is supported by intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation.&#160;&#160; Such research enables us to elucidate the substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of the crystals, and reminds us of the selection of the right path in a so&#8208;called &#8220;maze game&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Type of Macrocyclic Architectures Used for Optoelectronic Materials and Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has received much attention for decades. Macrocyclic architectures as representative receptors play a vital role in supramolecular chemistry and are applied in many fields such as supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition. However, the classical macrocycles generally lack functional groups in the scaffolds, which limit their further applications, especially in optoelectronic materials. Therefore, developing new design principle is not only essential to better understand macrocyclic chemistry and the supramolecular behaviors, but also further expand their applications in many research fields. In recent years, the doping compounds with main&#8208;group heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, P) into the carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles offered a new strategy to build macrocyclic architectures with unique optoelectronic properties. In particular, the energy gaps and redox behavior can be effectively tuned by incorporating heteroatoms into the macrocyclic scaffolds. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize the design and synthesis of new macrocycles, and further discuss the related applications in optoelectronic materials and supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe&#160;consisting of&#160;a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore)&#160;and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter.&#160;This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12 &#177; 1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2 &#177; 0.3) &#181;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85 &#177; 3 and a lower LOD of (13 &#177; 3) &#181;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimetalloylene (M&#8211;E&#8211;M) Complexes of Heavier Main Group Elements Ge, Sn, Pb, Bi via Cleavage of E&#8211;X Bonds (X = N(SiMe3)2, OtBu) with an Iridium Hydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of the Ir(V) hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI = (Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E = Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 by the apparent cleavage of an E&#8212;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8212;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Variations of the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group 15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared via the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(O t Bu)3, to afford the first example of a &#8216;naked&#8217; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reactions of the Ir(V) hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI = (Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E = Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2-E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2-Ge)2 was formed in situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;Task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones was developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable Fe(III)&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#183;6H2O/Gly (3:1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i) under mild (45 &#186;C) and bench type reaction conditions (air); and ii) in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30 minutes and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated just by simple decantation of the liquid Fe(III)&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle our Fe(III)&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to 8 consecutive times. Furthermore, our Fe(III)&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, being the system recycled up to 3 consecutive times. Preliminary investigations on a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seems to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic&#8208; and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis owing to their biological importance. Also, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings led to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization via C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods of these molecules require the usage of acid catalysts or transition&#8208;metals. Recently, electroorganic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which is driven by inexpensive electricity, is a green and unique approach to otherwise challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The difficulty associated with the technique is imposed by the fleeting nature of radicals and the gap between electrodes. This concept article introduces recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in this field and discusses how to overcome the obstacles.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.

Herein, an efficient and green procedure for the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with tryptamines is reported. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of the iPrPNP&#8722;Mn catalyst and a weak base (Na2CO3). This method tolerated a variety of benzylic and aliphatic alcohol substrates with different functional groups and afforded diverse products in good to excellent isolated yields using tryptamines. Using this strategy, we successfully synthesised pharmaceutical molecules harman, harmaline, and harmine in a concise manner.

         <title>HAV&#8208;Peptides Attached to Colloidal Probes Faithfully Detect E&#8208;Cadherins Displayed on Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a minimum of chemistry, we developed a tool based on functionalized colloidal probes that mimic the presence of adjacent cells detecting the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on the cell surface. The specificity and dynamic strength of the peptide&#8208;E&#8208;cadherin interaction can be read out demonstrating the potential for a label&#8208;free screening of cell surfaces.







Abstract
Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological processes, including wound healing, barrier formation and tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelial cells. To identify this molecule on the surface of cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical amino acid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized and attached to solid&#8208;supported membranes covering colloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies were established, one based on the complexation of DOGS&#8208;NTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide using in&#8197;situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attach to the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield by lipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on living cells either using video particle tracking or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examined confirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods were also used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essential for the development of novel biosynthetic materials given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medical applications.

         <title>Dinuclear Iron(II) Triple Helicates Exhibiting Room Temperature Spin&#8208;Transition Behaviour in Solid and Solution Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three iron(II) dinuclear helicates exhibit incomplete, multistep and single&#8208;step spin transition behaviour close to room temperature in solid, as well as in solution phases. Complexes possess the different crystallographic space groups, which results in different crystallographic packing of the complexes. This, in turn, affects the cooperativity throughout the Fe centre of the crystal lattice, which plays a major role in such spin&#8208;state transition.







Abstract
Herein, three dinuclear iron(II) helicates bearing the molecular formula [Fe2(L1)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (complex 1), [Fe2(L2)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6CH3CN (complex 2), and [Fe2(L3)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5H2O (complex 3) have been synthesized using imidazole and pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based ligands having fluorene moiety in the backbone. A change in the ligand field strength by terminal modulation led to a change in the spin&#8208;transition behaviour from incomplete, multi&#8208;step to complete, around room temperature in the solid state. Spin transition behaviour has also been observed in the solution phase characterized using variable temperature 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Evans method) and correlated using UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Fitting the NMR data using the ideal solution model yielded the transition temperature in the order T1/2 (1)&lt;T1/2 (2)&lt;T1/2 (3), which indicates an increase in the ligand field strength from complexes 1 to 3. This study accentuates the interplay between the ligand field strength, crystal packing, and supramolecular interactions in fine&#8208;tuning the spin transition behaviour effectively.

United we stand: Oligomers designed to form helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix super&#8208;secondary structures have been prepared by covalently bridging aliphatic oligourea foldamer helices with either rigid aromatic or more flexible aliphatic spacers. The relative helix orientation in these dimers was investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in difficult cases using racemic crystallography. Most X&#8208;ray structures reveal well&#8208;defined parallel helical hairpin motifs, irrespective of primary sequence and chain length.







Abstract
Oligomers designed to form a helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix super&#8208;secondary structure have been prepared by covalently bridging aliphatic oligourea foldamer helices with either rigid aromatic or more flexible aliphatic spacers. The relative helix orientation in these dimers was investigated at high resolution using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In several cases, racemic crystallography was used to facilitate crystallization and structure determination. All structures were solved by direct methods. Well&#8208;defined parallel helical hairpin motifs were observed in all cases when 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate was employed as a dimerizing agent, irrespective of primary sequence and chain length.

         <title>Investigations into Simplified Analogues of the Herbicidal Natural Product (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Cornexistin has long been of interest to the crop protection community due to its interesting herbicidal profile and unique mode of action. However, the complex chemical structure of cornexistin has hindered further research into new analogues. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure, we investigated simplified analogues of cornexistin that focused on the effects that the functional groups located on the right&#8208;hand side of the 9&#8208;membered ring have on herbicidal efficacy and target affinity.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure of cornexistin bound to transketolase from Zea mays, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine&#8208;membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.

Thermodynamic activation parameters of the click reaction with two strained alkynes were determined using Eyring plots, and show that the reaction is controlled by entropic factors.







Abstract
Reaction rates of strained cycloalkynes and cycloalkenes with 1,2&#8208;quinone were quantified by stopped flow UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis. We found that the strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 (k2 1824&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) reacts &gt;150&#8197;times faster than the strained alkene TCO&#8208;OH 5 (k2 11.56&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and that derivatization with a carbamate can lead to a reduction of the rate constant with almost half. Also, the 8&#8208;membered strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 reacts 16&#8197;times faster than the more strained 7&#8208;membered THS 2 (k2 110.6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone 1 with THS 2 is associated with &#916;H&#8800; of 0.80&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;46.8 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=14.8&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3 is associated with, &#916;H&#8800;=2.25&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;36.3 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=13.1&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped&#8208;flow measurements, with calculated &#916;G&#8800; of 15.6&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS 2, and with &#916;G&#8800; of 14.7&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid click reactions.

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Vacancies on VO2 Multilayered Structures for Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduce electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancies would lead to a reverse effect. The oxygen vacancy contents in VO2 can be regulated and Od&#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum vacancy concentration achieves a good performance with high capacity, long cycle stability and high energy density.







Abstract
Vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) is a proper cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to its shear structure and high theoretical capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and structure instability derived from the strong electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the VO2 host hinder its further application. Defect engineering is a useful way to circumvent the limitations. Herein, oxygen&#8208;defect VO2 (Od&#8208;VO2) with tunable oxygen vacancy concentration are obtained via a facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal method by adjusting ascorbic acid addition. It is proved that oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduced electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancy content would lead to a reverse effect. The Od&#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum oxygen vacancy concentration achieves an outstanding performance with a high capacity of 380 mAhg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A g&#8722;1, excellent cycle stability with 92.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 197&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 0.641&#8197;kW kg&#8722;1. Therefore, this defect engineering method for Od&#8208;VO2 provides an attractive way for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIB cathodes.

         <title>Molecular Assembly and Gelating Behavior of (l)&#8208;Alanine Derivatives</title>

A low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived from (L)&#8208;amino acids was designed and synthesized. The (L)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates by self&#8208;molecular recognition.







Abstract
In this study, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived from (l)&#8208;amino acids was designed and synthesized. Gelation assays using (l)&#8208;amino acid derivatives were performed to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid&#8208;derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self&#8208;molecular aggregates. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates by self&#8208;molecular recognition.

         <title>Defluorination of Fluorophenols by a Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species: Observation of a New Intermediate Along the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study on a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species in reaction with halophenols gives efficient dehalogenation including defluorination in the product. Along the reaction mechanism a novel intermediate is characterized spectroscopically and assigned to be an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo adduct.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health as well as in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with halophenols through defluorination reactions and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We study the reactivity pattern of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species with a series of trihalophenols (X=F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with &#955;max at 558&#8197;nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.

         <title>Protocell Self&#8208;Assembly Driven by Sodium Trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus is not only an essential element for life but also an important activation component for multiple types of prebiotics on early Earth. Synergistic symbiosis between N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;type membrane precursor and peptide can be realized via sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m) activation effect based on the different activation mechanisms, which plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells.







Abstract
The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. However, more research is required on both processes, particularly on the interaction between prebiotic simple fatty&#8208;acid membranes and peptide synthesis. In this study, the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of phenylalanine (Phe) in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system was systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA). Decanoic acid was activated by P3m to form a mixed anhydride, which then reacted with an amino acid to form the amide NAA. As a kind of membrane&#8208;forming amphiphile, NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. Moreover, 11 other representative amino acids, namely alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), and arginine (Arg), were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. The abovementioned mechanism involving P3m&#8208;activated carboxylic acid has not been reported in the literature. Our experimental results indicate that the participation of decanoic acid in the P3m activation&#8208;based peptide formation reaction system plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells. The P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.

         <title>Trinuclear PdII Complexes with a C3&#8208;Symmetric Triethynylbenzene&#8208;Based Tris&#8208;NHC Ligand: Catalytic Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>

Catalytic benefits: Trinuclear PdII complexes with an extended C3&#8208;symmetric triethynylbenzene&#8208;based tris&#8208;NHC ligand are presented. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex. An electronic effect in the trinuclear ligand platform is likely to be responsible for the better catalytic activity of the trinuclear complexes over mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
A new C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;imidazolium tribromide salt 3, featuring 1,3,5&#8208;substituted triethynylbenzene, was used for the preparation of a trinuclear PdII pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation&#8208;type (PEPPSI) complex by triple C2 deprotonation followed by the addition of PdCl2. Trinuclear PdII complex possessing a combination of NHC and PPh3 ligands has also been synthesized. The corresponding mononuclear palladium(II) complexes have also been synthesized for the comparison purpose. All these complexes have been characterized by using NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the trinuclear palladium(II) complex bearing mixed carbene and pyridine donor ligands has been established by using single crystal XRD. All the palladium(II) complexes have been used as pre&#8208;catalysts, which gave good to excellent yields in intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole and Sonogashira coupling reaction. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex for both catalytic transformations. The better performance of the trinuclear complex has also been further supported by preliminary electrochemical measurements. A negative mercury poison test was observed for both the aforementioned catalyses and therefore, it is likely that these organic transformations proceed homogeneously.

         <title>A Transparent, Healable and Recyclable Alicyclic Poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) Multiblock Copolymer with Ultrahigh Toughness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of healable alicyclic poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymers (PEBA&#8208;I539, PEBA&#8208;I875, and PEBA&#8208;I1212), consisting of an asymmetric diamine (IPDA) with substantial steric hindrance, were successfully synthesized, and PEBA&#8208;I1212 with record&#8208;high strength and toughness for self&#8208;healing polyamide&#8208;based elastomers exhibited great prospects as a protective coating and flexible substrate for soft electronics.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healing polyamide multiblock copolymer with robust mechanical properties is highly desired. Here, an alicyclic diamine monomer, isophoronediamine (IPDA), with asymmetric structure and substantial steric hindrance was incorporated into the backbone of poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymer. Based on the phase&#8208;lock effect, the mechanical properties and segmental mobility of copolymers can be modulated on a large scale via adjusting the molecular weight of hard segments. An extraordinary tensile strength of 32.0&#8197;MPa and an excellent elongation at break of 1881&#8201;% were simultaneously achieved, which leaded to a record&#8208;high toughness of 328.9&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 for self&#8208;healable polyamide elastomers. The synergism between the dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks and the diffusion of polymer chains contributed to a balance between the mechanical performance and self&#8208;healing efficiency of copolymers. Due to the adjustable mechanical performance, rapid scratch self&#8208;healing ability and superior impact resistance, the resultant copolymers showed great potential in the fields of protective coatings and soft electronics.

         <title>Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry With Collision Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinide gas phase chemistry: When uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) are subjected to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation, the resulting fragment ion products reflect UPCs solid&#8208;state chemistry. Although the peroxo groups exact chemistry is not preserved, the presence of superoxo groups is observed, which suggests that electrochemical reactions of peroxo groups are taking place at the capillary tip of the ESI.







Abstract
Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ESI&#8208;MS/MS) was utilized to study the gas phase fragmentation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters with hydroxo, peroxo, oxalate, and pyrophosphate bridging ligands. These nanoclusters fragment into uranium monomers and dimers with mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge (m/z) ratios in the 280&#8211;380 region. The gas phase fragmentation of each cluster studied yields a distinct UO6&#8722; anion attributed to the cleavage of a uranyl ion bound to 2 peroxide groups, along with other anions that can be attributed to the initial composition of the nanoclusters.

         <title>Reactivity of a Strictly T&#8208;Shaped Phosphine Ligated by an Acridane Derived NNN Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and reactivity of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine derived from an NNN acridane pincer ligand is reported. Phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is observed, and the activation of hydridic and protic E&#8722;H bonds is demonstrated, including complete disassembly of water.







Abstract
The steric tuning of a tridentate acridane&#8208;derived NNN pincer ligand allows for the isolation of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine that exhibits ambiphilic reactivity. Well&#8208;defined phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is reported, contrasting with prior reports on this class of compounds. Reactions towards oxidants are also described. The latter result in the two&#8208;electron oxidation of the phosphorus atom from +III to +V and are accompanied by a strong geometric distortion of the NNN pincer ligand. By contrast, cooperative activation of E&#8722;H (HCl, HBcat, HOMe) bonds proceeds with retention of the phosphorus redox state. When using H2O as a substrate, the reaction results in the full disassembly of H2O to its constituent atoms, highlighting the potential of this platform for small molecule activation reactions.

         <title>Thin Layer Chromatography&#8208;Freeze Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: A Powerful Tool for Monitoring Synthetic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising tool used in combination with thin layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain direct molecular information on the spots. However, the stationary phase and impurities on nanoparticles used in SERS can negatively affect the efficacy of the TLC&#8208;SERS. The present study shows that freezing improves TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency, allowing for the identification of compounds with high sensitivity and the monitoring of synthetic reactions quantitatively.







Abstract
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification as it primarily relies on retention factors. Coupling of TLC with surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which gives direct molecular information, is an appropriate choice, to overcome this challenge. However, interference from the stationary phase and impurities on the nanoparticles added for SERS measurements significantly degrades TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency. It was found that freezing effectively eliminates such interferences and dramatically improves the performance of TLC&#8208;SERS. In this study, TLC&#8208;freeze SERS is applied to the monitoring of four chemically important reactions. The proposed method can identify the product and side&#8208;products of similar structures, detect compounds with high sensitivity, and provide information of quantities that allows the reliable determination of the reaction time based on kinetic analysis.

         <title>Modulating Energy Transfer and Light&#8208;Emitting Colors by Chiral Dye Exchange and Achiral&#8208;to&#8208;Chiral Dye Conversion</title>

Pure exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;dye stereoisomers, and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer were prepared. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals the spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals precise exo&#8208;configuration and dynamic nature of Diels&#8211;Alder covalent bonds. A chiral dye solid displayed circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence due to the chiral transfer from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore.







Abstract
New chiral and achiral dyes were synthesized by using clean, highly efficient Diels&#8211;Alder &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. We prepared pure endo&#8208; and exo&#8208; stereoisomers and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels&#8211;Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light&#8208;emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, light&#8208;emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene&#8208;to&#8208;dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.&#8201;e., circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another yields 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis.

After bromination and nucleophilic ring opening, the second intramolecular Hiyama coupling provided various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. The optical resolution of 1,8,13&#8208;triptycene afforded an optically active form for the first time.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Cs2SnBr6/rGO Composite for Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance for the selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived HMF, obtaining&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% selectivity of DFF with the synergistic effect of &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2. This study shows that Cs2SnBr6&#8208;based perovskite provides more possibilities and options in employing highly efficient and environment&#8208;stable lead&#8208;free perovskites.







Abstract
Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology&#8208;friendly, air&#8208;stable and highly active metal&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs2SnBr6 decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as&#8208;prepared Cs2SnBr6 is ultrastable, exhibiting no clear changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo&#8208;driven&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O2. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo&#8208;driven conversion of HMF to DFF.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study shows that Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-based perovskite provides more possibilities and options in employing highly efficient and environment-stable lead-free perovskites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic-inorganic lead-based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology-friendly, air-stable and highly active metal-halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead-free perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as-prepared Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is ultrastable, exhibiting no clear changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo-driven-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), achieving&amp;gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond activation reactions (OH, NH) of stereoisomeric disilenes are often 100&#8201;% stereospecific. Although we have a good understanding of the possible reaction pathways to the isomeric products, without a deeper understanding of the influence of the geometry of the disilene and the influence of the substituents on each elementary step, it remains difficult to predict the stereochemistry of the products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100&#8201;% stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable time normalization analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04&#177;0.06 at 298&#8197;K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The formation of the donor adduct is the rate determining step. The results of this study, together with previous studies on the addition of ammonia and amines to disilenes, allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Haloalkenyl Boronates by Halogenative Semipinacol Rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen&#8208;induced halogenative semipinacol rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols is reported herein. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions to access a variety of synthetically valuable carbonyl&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates with moderate to good yields and excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of stereo&#8208;defined and transformable functionality&#8208;enriched building blocks is of great importance in modern organic chemistry, as it allows the rapid and divergent assembly of complex molecules. Herein a halogen electrophile (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) initiated semipinacol rearrangement reaction of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols (MIDA=N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl) by aryl migration towards the synthesis of amphoteric &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates in moderate to good yields with excellent stereoselectivities is reported. The value of the products is evidenced by their ability to undergo divergent conversions to polysubstituted alkenes through manipulation of the C&#8722;B and C&#8722;X (X=Br, I) bonds and the carbonyl group.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Ene Click Reaction of Electron&#8208;Deficient &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules with Negative Activation Enthalpies</title>

Amino&#8208;ene click reaction of an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with an amine that proceeds faster at lower temperatures in some solvents. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction would open up a new versatile platform for amino&#8208;functionalization of brittle or unstable &#960;&#8208;systems under mild conditions.







Abstract
An amino&#8208;ene click reaction is a type of aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction that is congruent with click chemistry in terms of its reaction efficiency and rate under mild conditions. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction is increasingly recognized as a prominent synthetic tool to form C&#8722;N bonds in the context of organic materials chemistry and polymer chemistry. Herein, an unconventional amino&#8208;ene click reaction with negative activation enthalpies, in which an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, such as a naphthalenediimide, reacts with an amine faster at lower temperatures is reported. The detailed study of the reaction mechanism reveals that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeds via a pre&#8208;equilibrium reaction, the key to which is the formation of a stable reaction intermediate due to the solvation and charge delocalization on the &#960;&#8208;core. By optimizing the reaction conditions, it was demonstrated that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeded faster at 273&#8197;K than at 347&#8197;K, which was easily observed visually.

         <title>A 2&#8208;Anilidomethylpyridine Ligand Framework Showcasing Hydride Storage and Transfer Abilities in Its Aluminum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework, a proven ancillary support, undergoes 1,4&#8208;hydroalumination by AlH3(NMe2Et) and models the hydride storage in Hantzsch esters and biological cofactors like NADH or NAD(P)H. DFT analyses suggest a &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; hydroalumination mechanism that underlines alane's acid&#8208;base duality. AlMe3 in contrast does not lead to such pyridyl dearomatization.

Dearomatized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridyl motifs are significant in both chemistry and biology for their potential abilities to deliver the stored hydride, driven by rearomatization. Biological cofactors like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and organic &#8216;hydride sources&#8217; like Hantzsch esters are prime examples. An organoaluminum chemistry on a 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework is reported, where such hydride storage and transfer abilities are displayed by the ligand's pyridyl unit. The pyridylmethylaniline proligand (NNLH) is simultaneously deprotonated and 1,4&#8208;hydroaluminated by AlH3(NMe2Et) to [(NNLde)AlH(NMe2Et)] (1; NNLde=hydride&#8208;inserted dearomatized version of NNL). A hydride abstraction by B(C6F5)3 rearomatizes the pyridyl moiety to give the cationic aluminum hydride [(NNL)AlH(NMe2Et)][HB(C6F5)3] (6). Notably, such chemical non&#8208;innocence is priorly unseen in this established ligand class. The hydroalumination mechanism is investigated by isolating the intermediate [(NNL)AlH2] (2) and by control experiments, and is also analyzed by DFT calculation. The results advocate an intriguing &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; pathway, which underlines alane's Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base duality. NMe2Et carrying the alane also plays a crucial role. In contrast, the chemistry between NNLH and AlMe3 is much different, giving only [(NNL)AlMe2] (4) from the adduct [(NNLH)AlMe3] (3) by deprotonation but not a subsequent pyridyl dearomatization in the presence or absence of NMe2Et. This divergence is also justified by DFT analyses.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>

A DNA&#8208;based dissipation system with synchronized multiple molecular fuels provides multiple transient states and enhanced complexity. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels.







Abstract
Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system is demonstrated that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule extends the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. It is envisioned that the system will find broad application in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery.

         <title>Wettability&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Array with Subnanochannels Enables Efficient Separation of Mono&#8208;/Multivalent Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF array membranes with subnanochannels were prepared by using confined interfacial reaction for selective separation of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ions. The key is regulating the location of oil/water interfaces though reducing the difference of contact angle of oil and water. Due to the diversity of porous materials, the presented strategy is expected to provide new possibilities for the development of advanced membranes with subnanochannels for practical applications.







Abstract
Achieving efficient separation of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ions is essential in various fields, yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels that exhibit high selectivity and ion permeability in the sieving of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ion was developed. Specifically, we used confined interfacial reaction at room temperature to synthesis the MOF array inside the micrometer through&#8208;pores of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane. The location of the oil/water interface was regulated by adjusting the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of MOF crystals, we were able to effectively separate monovalent metal ions from multivalent metal ions with selectivity reaching up to 3930&#177;373 (e.g., Li+/Zr4+). The fluxes of Li+ ions were observed to be as high as 1.97&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. The MOF array&#8208;based membrane with subnanochannels that we have developed exhibits great promise for applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines, and other related fields.

         <title>Structural Perspective into the Interaction of an Oncogenesis&#8208;Relevant pre&#8208;miRNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligand Carrier with the Protein Nucleolin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural study of the complex between nucleolin, a protein involved in a myriad of human diseases, and the RNA G4 found in pre&#8208;miRNA 149 stabilized by the compound C8, known for its G4 stabilizing properties, was conducted. The results provide important molecular determinants at the atomic level and may pave the way for future investigations in the field.







Abstract
The structural determinants of the interaction of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) motif found in precursor miRNA 149 (rG4) with the acridine orange derivative C8, a G4 ligand stabilizer possessing anticancer activity, and the protein nucleolin (overexpressed in cancer cells) were investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For the rG4/C8 complex, the results revealed a strong stabilizing interaction between the aromatic core and the iodinated ring of the C8 ligand with the rG4 structure. The NMR study revealed also different interaction patterns between nucleolin and rG4 and nucleolin and rG4/C8 complex. In the absence of the ligand, rG4 establishes interactions with polar residues of the protein while for the rG4/C8 complex, these contacts are mainly established with amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains. However, nucleolin chemical shift perturbation studies in the presence of rG4 or rG4/C8 reveal the same location between domains 1 and 2 of the protein, which suggests that the rG4 and rG4/C8 complex bind in this region. This puzzling structural study opens a new framework to study rG4/ligand/nucleolin complexes that might impact the biogenesis of miRNA 149.

Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how the regioselectivity between [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions of tropone can be steered by the use of Lewis acids, which catalyze the reactions via a LUMO&#8208;lowering effect.

We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12&#8197;kcal mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.

         <title>&#963;,&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bis(germylene) Adducts with NHC and CAACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both N&#8208;heterocyclic and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (NHC and CAACs) form the carbene coordinated &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugated adducts from one and the same bis(germylene). Their structures and properties are fundamentally different: while the strong Ge=C double bonds in the bis(germene) outperform the dative bonds in the NHC adduct, the latter serves as precursor for polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the reaction with triphenylborane.







Abstract
Heavier tetrylenes attract attention for their potential in synthesis, catalysis and small molecule activation. The coordination by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) results in substantial structural and electronic differences although typically only one of these yields stable derivatives for one and the same tetrylene. We now report both NHC&#8208; and CAAC&#8208;coordination to a bridged bis(germylene) motif. The NHC&#8208;coordinated bis(germylene) exhibits pyramidal germanium centers with lone pairs of electrons, while with CAAC an unprecedented stable bis(germene) with two Ge=C bonds is isolated. Spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence as well as DFT calculations confirm the effects of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation between the two germanium centers in both cases. The coordination of NHC is reversible as the reaction with BPh3 liberates the transient bis(germylene) and thus provides an alternative low&#8208;temperature route towards polymers with Ge=Ge bonds.

         <title>De&#8208;Risking S&#8208;F Bond Formation: A Gas Cylinder&#8208;Free Strategy to Access S(IV) and S(VI) Fluorinated Compounds

         <dc:description>
Herein we report the oxidative halogenation of thiols via the ex situ generation of chlorine by employing calcium hypochorite as solid bench&#8208;stable precursor. This approach enables the synthesis of three distinct classes of compounds (R&#8208;SF3, RSO2F and RSF4Cl). Metastable R&#8208;SF4Cl intermediates are further postfunctionalized to access structures of higher complexity, and computational analysis elucidate potential pathways that leads to cis&#8208;selectivity for certain heteroaromatic SF4Cl structures.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;fluorine partnership occupies a privileged position in fluorine chemistry given the functional versatility that it imparts to organic structures. Despite this, available methodologies to forge S&#8722;F bonds are limited compared to C&#8722;F bond formation. Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF4Cl, SO2F and SF3 derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)&#8208;F or S(VI)&#8208;F compounds is achieved by employing bench&#8208;stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF4Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox&#8208;free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine&#8208;tuning. Furthermore, first&#8208;in&#8208;class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF4Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post&#8208;functionalizations that allow accessing highly complex SF4&#8208;bridged scaffolds.

Foldamer hairpin&#8208;like motifs have been prepared by connecting oligourea helices with various alkyl and aralkyl linkers, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Some specific geometrical parameters like interhelical dihedral angles and helical twists were measured, thus allowing precise comparison between the different supersecondary structures.

         <title>Cover Feature: Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry With Collision Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands (Chem. Eur. J. 39/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting the presence of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) in solution is difficult, so this study used tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation to probe bridging ions surrounding the uranyl ion and to determine fragmentation fingerprints of UPCs. The image shows an abstract artistic representation of the nanocluster U24Pp12, [(UO2)24(O2)24(P2O7)12]48&#8211;, and its movement through a quadrupole mass analyzer with subsequent fragmentation. More information can be found in the Research Article by V.&#8197;G. Rodriguez and P.&#8197;C. Burns (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300794). Image designed by V.G.R.

The proximity of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Pd plays an important role not only in the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladium species in intramolecular Hiyama coupling, but also in the activation of the silyl group to facilitate intramolecular substituent transfer. Various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes were synthesized by using this reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300988).

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis with Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 39, July 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. This review summarized the latest advances in the field of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, the strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. Taking advantage of synergistic visible light photocatalysis with organocatalysis, remarkable progress has recently been achieved in modern chemical synthesis. In these dual catalytic systems, photocatalysts or photosensitizers absorb visible light to induce their photo&#8208;excited states which can activate unreactive substrates via electron or energy transfer mechanisms, and organocatalysts are usually employed to control the chemical reactivities of the other substrates. This review mainly focuses on the recent development of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels Formed inside Solid&#8208;State Nanopore with Proton Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 were grown in&#8197;situ within the pores of quartz nanopores for super&#8208;selective proton transport. When the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopores are prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, it is difficult for lithium ions to pass through the channels, but the protons can facilitate the transport of protons, resulting in ultrahigh selectivity for protons.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom&#8208;scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO&#8208;66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid&#8208;state nanopores for ultra&#8208;selective proton transport. UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in&#8208;situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl&#8722;) were unchanged. Compared with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub&#8208;nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.

Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. Anions can be classified into different configurations, and the various configurations and types of anions can significantly influence the supramolecular interactions and stacking modes between anions and cations in compounds, ultimately leading to changes in the SCO properties.







Abstract
The field of anion supramolecular chemistry has received more and more attention in recent years. Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. This review is devoted to anion effects on the molecular, supramolecular structures and magnetic properties of discrete SCO compounds. Firstly, typical anions used in the synthesis of these compounds are briefly summarized according to their various geometries. This is followed by a collection of representative examples of anion&#8208;based SCO compounds, whose SCO properties are analyzed in terms of supramolecular interactions, geometry and charge of anions. In the third part, anion effects on SCO complexes of different kinds of metal centers and ligands are outlined and finally remarks on the synthesis new type of ionic SCO complexes in the future are described.

         <title>Regulating Magnetic Relaxations of Cyano&#8208;Bridged {DyIIIMoV} Systems by Tuning the N&#8208;Sites in &#946;&#8208;Diketone Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} complexes 1&#8211;4, consisting of DyIII ions, &#946;&#8208;diketone (HLn: n=1, 2, 3, 4) ligands, and [Mo(CN)8]3&#8722;, are obtained by adjusting the N&#8208;sites of &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands. Their magnetic properties are highly dependent on the magnetic axis and magnetic anisotropy of the DyIII centers, which can be regulated by different coordination environments (DyOnN(8&#8208;n): n=5, 6, 7) of the DyIII centers.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8211;4f molecular nanomagnets have re&#8208;called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they offer more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, four &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands bearing different substitution N&#8208;sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL1), 1,3&#8208;Bis (3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL2), 1&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL3), and 1,3&#8208;Bis (4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL4), to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} systems. By reacting with DyCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O and K4Mo(CN)8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, four cyano&#8208;bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL1)2(H2O)3]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (1), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL2)(H2O)3(CH3OH)]}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (2), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL3)(H2O)2(CH3OH)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O}n (3), and {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL4)2(H2O)3]} &#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8901;CH3OH (4) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that 1 and 4 are binuclear complexes, 2 has a tetragonal structure, and 3 exhibits a stair&#8208;like polymer chain structure. The DyIII ions in all complexes have eight&#8208;coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO7N1 for 1 and 4, DyO6N2 for 2, and DyO5N3 for 3. Magnetic measurements indicate that 1 is a zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes 2&#8211;4 are field&#8208;induced SMMs, with complex 4 featuring a two&#8208;step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and ab initio calculations revealed that changing the N&#8208;sites in the &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8211;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the DyIII centers.

         <title>Selective Hydroxylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds in Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steroids are C(sp3)&#8208;rich structures and are highly prevalent in small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. This review covers highly selective methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxidation, and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.







Abstract
Steroids are highly prevalent structures in small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. These C(sp3)&#8208;rich tetracycles contain many stereocentres, which are important for creating specific vectors and protein binding orientations. Therefore, the ability to hydroxylate steroids with a high degree of regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity is essential for researchers working in this field. This review will cover three main methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H hydroxylation and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkynes for the Synthesis of Derivatized Dihydropyrrolones: Regioselectivity Under Thermodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentadienyliron species mediate propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of simple, unactivated alkynes for the synthesis of densely substituted and diversely functionalized dihydropyrrolones. High regioselectivities are observed under conditions of thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl&#8208;based complexes present opportunities for underexplored disconnections in synthesis. Access to challenging dihydropyrrolone products is achieved by propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of alkynes for the formation of cyclic organoiron species. Excellent regioselectivity for unsymmetrical alkynes is observed in many cases. Notably, regioselectivity under these stoichiometric conditions diverges from those observed previously under catalysis, occurring at the more&#8208;substituted terminus of the alkyne, allowing for methine functionalization and the formation of quaternary centers. Divergent demetallation of the intermediate organoiron complexes gives access to chemically diverse products which are amenable to further functionalization.

         <title>Deuteration Degree&#8208;Controllable Methylation via a Cascade Assembly Strategy using Methylamine&#8208;Water as Methyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamine&#8208;water system was developed as a new methyl source for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones under mild photocatalytic reaction conditions. Degree&#8208;controllable deuterated methylation could be easily achieved by using distinct combinations of d&#8208;methylamine&#8208;D2O system, allowing for the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled bioactive molecules with a controllable number ranging from 0 to 3.







Abstract
We present a novel and effective photocatalytic method for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones with controllable degrees of deuterium incorporation via development of new methyl sources. By utilizing a methylamine&#8208;water system as the methyl precursor and a cascade assembly strategy for deuteration degree control, we synthesized methylated compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, showcasing the versatility of this approach. We examined a range of &#946;&#8208;diketone substrates and synthesized key intermediates for drug and bioactive compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, ranging from 0 to 3. We also investigated and discussed the postulated reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the utility of readily available reagents, methylamines and water, as a new methyl source, and provides a simple and efficient strategy for the synthesis of degree&#8208;controllable deuterium&#8208;labelled compounds.

         <title>Improved Luminous Efficiency of AgInS2 Quantum Dots and Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;70 Composite for White Light Emitting Diode Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgInS2 quantum dots (AIS QDs) are successfully introduced into the ZIF&#8208;70 framework via microwave assisted&#8208;hydrothermal method. The ZIF&#8208;70 matrix is beneficial to prevent the quenching of QDs and increase the luminous efficiency of QDs&#8208;based WLED from 5.44&#8197;lm/W to 36.76&#8197;lm/W.







Abstract
The application of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in the field of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is still an important challenge due to their low luminous efficiency and quenching phenomenon. In this paper, we prepared AgInS2 QDs/zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;70 (AIS/ZIF&#8208;70) composite by a microwave hydrothermal method. Owing to the high porosity and stability of ZIF&#8208;70, it could effectively prevent quenching issues due to the aggregation of QDs. Since the ZIF&#8208;70 and QDs were chemically bonded, the formation of the ZnS layer could effectively passivate the surface defect and thus the quantum yield reached 21.49&#8201;% in aqueous solution. The luminous efficiency (LE) of the assembled AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED was reinforced by 6.8&#8197;times with a molar ratio of AgIn/Zn=18, i.&#8201;e. at 5.26&#8201;% molar fraction of ZIF&#8208;70. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED were 84.3 and 3631&#8197;K, respectively, indicating its potential application in solid&#8208;state lighting.

         <title>Covalently Modified MoS2 Bearing a Hamilton&#8208;Type Receptor for Recognizing a Redox&#8208;Active Ferrocene&#8208;Barbiturate Guest via Multiple H&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Hamilton&#8208;type recognition motif is realized on the surface of 1T&#8208;MoS2 where host&#8208;guest interactions are taking place via hydrogen bonding for the electrochemical sensing of barbiturates.







Abstract
The covalent modification of the metallic phase of MoS2 with a Hamilton&#8208;type ligand is presented, transforming MoS2 to a recognition platform which is able to embrace barbiturate moieties via hydrogen bonding. The successful hydrogen bonding formation is easily monitored by simple electrochemical assessments, if a ferrocene&#8208;labeled barbiturate analogue is utilized as a proof of concept. Full spectroscopic, thermal, and electron microscopy imaging characterization is provided for the newly formed recognition system, along with valuable insights concerning the electrochemical sensing. The given methodology expands beyond the sensing applications, confidently entering the territory of supramolecular interactions on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. The well&#8208;designed host&#8208;guest chemistry presented herein, constitutes a guide and an inspiration for hosting customized&#8208;structured functional building blocks on MoS2 and its relatives via hydrogen bonding, opening up new opportunities regarding potential applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte in Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;S and Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

A new electrolyte membrane based on crystalline poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME) allows the development of efficient, safe and high&#8208;energy lithium metal solid&#8208;polymer batteries with different cathodes, including LiFePO4, sulfur or oxygen operating at room temperature.







Abstract
A solid polymer electrolyte has been developed and employed in lithium&#8208;metal batteries of relevant interest. The material includes crystalline poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME), LiTFSI and LiNO3 salts, and a SiO2 ceramic filler. The electrolyte shows ionic conductivity more than 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and approaching 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, a Li+&#8208;transference number exceeding 0.3, electrochemical stability from 0 to 4.4&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li, lithium stripping/deposition overvoltage below 0.08&#8197;V, and electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance of 400&#8197;&#937;. Thermogravimetry indicates that the electrolyte stands up to 200&#8201;&#176;C without significant weight loss, while FTIR spectroscopy suggests that the LiTFSI conducting salt dissolves in the polymer. The electrolyte is used in solid&#8208;state cells with various cathodes, including LiFePO4 olivine exploiting the Li&#8208;insertion, sulfur&#8211;carbon composite operating through Li conversion, and an oxygen electrode in which reduction and evolution reactions (i.&#8201;e., ORR/OER) evolve on a carbon&#8208;coated gas diffusion layer (GDL). The cells operate reversibly at room temperature with a capacity of 140&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.4&#8197;V for LiFePO4, 400&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;V for sulfur electrode, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.5&#8197;V for oxygen. The results suggest that the electrolyte could be applied in room&#8208;temperature solid polymer cells.

         <title>Photochemical Aminochlorination of Alkenes without the Use of an External Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical aminochlorination of alkenes: Appropriate tuning of the irradiation wavelength leads to a mild photochemical protocol for the aminochlorination of alkenes, bypassing the need of an external photocatalyst or the use of the more labile N&#8722;I or N&#8722;Br starting materials for the 1,2&#8208;aminohalogenation reactions.







Abstract
The niche field of photochemistry offers opportunities that are not found in &#8220;traditional&#8221; ground state chemical pathways. Aminochlorinated derivatives are an interesting family of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalised compounds that provide access to a variety of natural products and pharmaceutical active substances. A practical, catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination protocol is described herein, providing access to intermediates of great importance, utilising mild and photochemical reaction conditions (370&#8197;nm), where N&#8208;chlorosulfonamides are used as both nitrogen and chlorine sources. A wide variety of olefins, decorated with a plethora of functional groups, was tested providing excellent results (28&#8197;examples, 18&#8211;88&#8201;% yield). Mechanistic studies (UV&#8208;Vis, control experiments and quantum yield measurement) were also performed.

         <title>Synergistic promotion of large&#8208;current water splitting through interfacial engineering of hierarchically structured CoP&#8208;FeP nanosheets with rich P vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. In this study, we investigated a CoP&#8208;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8208;CoP&#8208;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8208;CoP&#8208;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and displaying robust durability (50 h @ 200 mA cm&#8208;2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76 V at 200 mA cm&#8208;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst's outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. Our study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#183;&#183;&#183;Amide Supramolecular Synthon for Tuning Amino Acid&#8208;Based Hydrogels&#8217; Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonding with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#183;&#183;&#183;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1:1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility to modulate the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels, by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is demonstrated to be also useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.</dc:description>

         <title>EPR Sensing of Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8208;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8226; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III).</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [1] and the quencher.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to producing high quality PQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25 nm PQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality PQDs for academic and industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P[[EQUATION]] with a = 5.125(2), b = 9.888(5), c = 10.217(5) &#197;, &#945; = 70.30(2), &#946; = 76.65(2), &#947; = 77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;7 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;mediated Isomerization of Spring&#8208;loaded 1,7&#8208;Enynes seen through the Lens of Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose a mechanism for the previously reported formation of benzobicyclo[3.2.0]heptane derivatives from 1,7&#8208;enyne derivatives bearing a terminal cyclopropane. Our calculations support the formation of the product through two sequential cyclopropane openings followed by the formation of an oxonium intermediate. The subsequent breakage of carbon&#8208;oxygen bond acts as driving force for the formation of an allene group. The DFT calculations also shed light on the reaction divergence depending on the substituents. These mechanistic insights will help guide the future development in the synthesis of challenging scaffolds through gold(I) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in photoelectrochemical bioconjugation between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Decoupled Water Electrolyzer Operating at Simulated Fluctuating Renewables with Tri&#8208;functional NiCo&#8208;P Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we design a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1) and long cycle life (80% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas permeation through mechanically resistant self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat amorphous organic cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution&#8208;processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Considering the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, e.g. for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolyl Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes such as iridium(III) and platinum(II) as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal&#8208;bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d&#8208;orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA&#8208;based OLEDs have been made. Here, a concept review of CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct amination of benzene with ammonia by flow plasma chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a micro&#8208;reactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8% and a selectivity of 49% in various amino compounds,</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Nitric Oxide Scavenging by Urea&#8208;Functionalized Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Modulates NO&#8208;Mediated Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, we developed urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in vitro, as aNO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Water Sorption/Desorption of a Nonporous Adaptive Organic Ligand Bridged Coordination Polymer for Atmospheric Moisture Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Moisture harvesters with favourable attributes such as easy synthetic availability and good processability as alternatives for atmospheric moisture harvesting (AWH) are desirable. We report here a novel nonporous anionic coordination polymer (CP) of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen (MV2+) as charge balancing ions (named U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP) which displays intriguing sequential water sorption/desorption behavior as the relative humidity (RH) changes gradually. The evaluation of AWH performance of U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP shows that it can absorb water vapor under air atmosphere at a low RH of 20% typical of the levels found in most dry regions of the world, and have good cycling durability, thus demonstrating the capability as a potential moisture harvester for AWH. To our knowledge, this is the first report on non&#8208;porous organic ligand bridged CP materials for AWH. Moreover, a stepwise water&#8208;filling mechanism for the water sorption/desorption process is deciphered by comprehensive characterizations combining single&#8208;crystal diffraction, which provides a reasonable explanation for the special moisture harvesting behaviour of this non&#8208;porous crystalline material.</dc:description>

         <title>Panchromatic Light Capturing Bis&#8208;Styryl BODIPY&#8208;Perylenediimide Donor&#8208;Acceptor Constructs: Occurrence of Sequential Energy Transfer Followed by Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two wide&#8208;band capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bisstrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI has been demonstrated. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bisstyrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectroelectrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron oxidized and one&#8208;electron reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bisstrylBODIPY.+ and PDI.&#8208; were possible to spectrally characterize and were subsequently utilized in characterizing the electron transfer products. Finally, pump&#8208;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bisstyrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT were in the range of 1011 s&#8208;1 while the electron transfer rate constants, kET were in the range of 1010 s&#8208;1 highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II) and gold(I) containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. Ru(II)&#8208; and Au(I)&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle assayed in vitro and in vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle, which can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. These findings indicate that metal coordination is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria.</dc:description>

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong Lewis acids are essential tools for a manifold of chemical procedures, but their scalable deployment is limited by their costs and safety concerns. We report a scalable, convenient, and inexpensive synthesis of stable diiminium&#8208;based reagents with a Lewis acidic carbon centre. Coordination with pyridine donors stabilises these centres; the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine adduct shows a chelation effect at carbon. Due to high fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities, the diiminium pyridine adducts are promising soft and hard Lewis acids. They effectively produce acylpyridinium salts from carboxylates which can&#160;acylate amines to give amides and imides even from electronically intractable coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Three oxidative addition routes of&#160;alkali metal aluminyls to dihydroaluminates and reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM = Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM = Li &#8211; Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8211; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8211;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting sp2 Dilithio Methandiides: From Geometric Curiosity to Simple Bonding Description</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8208;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheltering Mono&#8208;P&#8208;Ligated Metal Complexes in Porous Polystyrene Monolith: Effect of Aryl Pendant Stabilizers on Catalytic Durability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal centers that can generate coordinatively unsaturated metals in accessible and stable states have been developed using synthetic polymers with sophisticated ligand and scaffold designs, which required synthetic efforts. Herein, we report a simple and direct strategy for producing polymer&#8208;supported phosphine&#8208;metal complexes, which stabilizes mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated metals by modulating the electronic properties of the aryl pendant groups in the polymer platform. A three&#8208;fold vinylated PPh3 was copolymerized with a styrene derivative and a cross&#8208;linker to produce a porous polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid monolith. Based on the Hammett substituent constants, the electronic properties of styrene derivatives were modulated and incorporated into the polystyrene backbone to stabilize the mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated Pd complex via Pd&#8208;arene interactions. Through NMR, TEM, and comparative catalytic studies, the polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid, which induces selective mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligation and moderate Pd&#8208;arene interactions, demonstrated high catalytic durability for the cross&#8208;coupling of chloroarenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalene Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient Narrow Emissive Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge in organic light emitting diodes. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA) embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N&#8208;B&#8208;O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450&#8208;470 nm. Small full width of half maximum&#160;of 25&#8208;29 nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. No obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2% and 7.9%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3% and 29.1%. More importantly, SNB with twist geometry enables stable EL spectra with almost unchanged FWHM under different doping concentrations. This work demonstrates the potential of NA extension design in constructing narrowband emissive blue emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selectivity in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;oxidation of diols can be predicted by a model, supported by experiments and computation. It explains the selective oxidation of hydroxy groups in cis&#8208;diols and the dependency of the rate on the configuration and conformational freedom. The model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is suited for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.







Abstract
A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8722;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first photocatalytic cross&#8208;pinacol coupling was achieved. The reaction proceeded with a various combination of two aldehydes, two ketones, or an aldehyde and a ketone to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols in up to 91&#8201;% yield. In this process, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ, by the assistance of CO2 additive, to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound.Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide (S. Okumura, Y. Uozumi et al.)







Abstract
Cross&#8208;pinacol coupling of two different carbonyl compounds was achieved through successive one&#8208;electron transfer processes under photocatalytic conditions. In the reaction, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound. It was revealed that a CO2 additive promoted the photocatalytic generation of the carbinol synthon to suppress undesired radical dimerization. A wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl substrates underwent the cross&#8208;pinacol coupling to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols, in which even a combination of carbonyl reactants with similar structures such as two aldehydes and two ketones were also well tolerated with high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity.

         <title>A Novel Approach to &#945;&#8208;Arylacetonitrile Skeletons via para&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Protected Anilines</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation reaction with ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate as the novel alkylating reagent to directly form an &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeleton with quaternary carbon center. Various protected anilines were tolerated, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation of protected anilines to construct &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons has been reported. We firstly disclosed the ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate was an effective alkylating reagent in ruthenmuim&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons can be directly obtained with moderate to good yields. Importantly, the products contain both nitrile and ester groups guaranteeing its direct transformation into other useful synthetic units, indicating the synthetic importance of this method.

         <title>A Bimetallic Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrathiolate (btt) Molybdenocene Complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2: Radical and Diradical States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox active bimetallic dithiolene complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2 (Mo2B) exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. The isolated dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+, with either chair or boat conformations associated with folded MoS2C2 metallacycles, exhibits a diradical character and strong antiferromagnetic coupling.







Abstract
Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8722;S hinge. The bis&#8208;oxidized dicationic complex exhibits a diradical character, with both radicals essentially localized on the metallacycles and with antiferromagnetic coupling evidenced from magnetic susceptibility measurements.

         <dc:description>We present the synthesis of a new type of an expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped morphology and its complexation of C60 guest molecules. The new macrocycle contains four carbazole and four triazole moieties and can be readily synthesized via a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction. It shows specific photo&#8208;physical properties including fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 60%. The combination of the saddle&#8208;shaped geometry with the expanded &#960;&#8208;system allows for host&#8208;guest interactions with C60 in a stacked polymer fashion. Evidence for the presence of a host&#8208;guest complex is provided both in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C7&#8208;H Arylation of Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines, using low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the coupling partners, and without any stoichiometric metal additives is reported. The structural motif of coupling products can be found in many drugs and organic materials.







Abstract
C7&#8208;Arylated pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines are important structural motifs with profound applications in drug and material research. Here, we report a general and straighforward synthesis of these bi(hetero)aryls via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation, employing low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the aryl source. The catalytic system is robust and covers a wide substrate scope regarding heteroarenes as well as (hetero)aryl chlorides, with possible extension to the C&#8722;H arylation of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines. This study also presents a rare example of using (hetero)aryl chlorides for the direct C&#8722;H arylation of six&#8208;membered heteroarenes.

&lt;p&gt;A new protocol for the palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of pyrazolo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]azines, using low-cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the coupling partners, and without any stoichiometric metal additives is reported. The structural motif of coupling products can be found in many drugs and organic materials.

         <title>Controlling Swing Rates in Macrocyclic Molecular Mortise Hinges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable temperature NMR shows that hinge rates can be controlled with steric congestion leading to a &#916;G&#8800; of 13.3 or 16.3&#8197;kcal/mol depending on constituent. These values are largely independent of solvent.







Abstract
Hinge motion is observed in macrocyclic, mortise&#8208;type molecular hinges using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The data is consistent with dynamic hinging from a folded&#8208;to&#8208;extended&#8208;to&#8208;folded enantiomeric state. Crystallographic and solution structures of the folded states are reported. Chemical shift predictions derived from crystallographic data corroborate fully revolute hinge motion. The rate of hinging is affected by steric congestion at the hinge axis. A macrocycle containing glycine, 1, hinges faster than one comprising aminoisobutyric acid, 2. The free energies of activation, &#916;G&#8800;, for 1 and 2 were determined to be 13.3&#177;0.3&#8197;kcal/mol and 16.3&#177;0.3&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. This barrier is largely independent of solvent across those surveyed (CD3OD, CD3CN, DMSO&#8208;d6, pyridine&#8208;d5, D2O). Experiment and computation predict energy barriers that are consistent with disruption of an intramolecular network of hydrogen bonds. DFT calculations reveal a pathway for hinge motion.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed H2S Probe and Scavenger for Specific Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfide scavenger: Molecular engineering of ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;responsive tools yields a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe and a scavenger for specifically imaging and downregulating the intratumoral H2S levels in live mice; this could potentially help to investigate H2S cancer biology and with related therapies.







Abstract
An expanding body of evidence suggests that specifically targeting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) might potentially benefit both tumor diagnosis and treatment, but there is still a lack of cancer&#8208;targeted molecular tools for in&#8197;vivo applications. Here, we report the first ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;specific near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensor PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and scavenger PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD that target the prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD displays a 53&#8208;fold off&#8211;on fluorescence response to H2S at 803&#8197;nm with high specificity. PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD can scavenge H2S fast (k2=30.8&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) without interference from biothiols. Both tools are highly water&#8208;soluble and can be transported selectively into PSMA&#8208;expressing prostate cancer cells. Endogenous H2S levels in murine 22Rv1 tumor models can be imaged and downregulated by intravenous injection of PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, respectively. These tools could potentially help to investigate H2S cancer biology and with related therapies.

         <title>Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylgalactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid synthesis of azasugars from achiral materials delivered a potent inhibitor of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGAL). Guanidine derivative, DGJNGuan, shows nanomolar inhibitory activity and high selectivity in&#8197;vitro. DGJNGuan is active in cells, elevating NAGAL substrate levels in an image&#8208;based assay and shows high selectivity.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in a range of disease. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;galactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and other glycoconjugates. Starting from non&#8208;carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490&#8197;nM) and &#945;&#8208;NAGAL selective (&#8764;200&#8208;fold) guanidino&#8208;containing derivative DGJNGuan. To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image&#8208;based method to measure levels of the Tn&#8208;antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL. Using this assay, we show that DGJNGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50=150&#8197;nM). Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal &#946;&#8208;hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJNGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off&#8208;target inhibition both in&#8197;vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Separated 24 &#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;facially linked rosarin dimer containing two antiaromatic monomeric macrocyclic units. Low temperature spectroscopic measurements and quantum mechanical calculations provide support for the conclusion that relative to the monomeric constituents the degree of antiaromaticity is reduced in the dimer.







Abstract
Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady&#8208;state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including time&#8208;dependent density functional theory, anisotropy of induced current density, and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77&#8197;K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.

         <title>Natural Light&#8208;Regulated Switchable Self&#8208;Adhesive Supramolecular Films for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films, which show tough and long&#8208;term stable adhesion to commercially available organic and inorganic glass, are used to construct smart windows. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sun, rain, and clouds.







Abstract
Switchable self&#8208;adhesive films are promising coating materials for constructing smart windows. Compared to commonly used hydrogels, self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films have a variety of advantages and serve as a universal carrier of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, supramolecular adhesive material is processed into self&#8208;adhesive films, which display tough and long&#8208;term stable adhesion to commercially available organic/inorganic glass windows. Spiropyrans are used as the photo&#8208;responsive units to endow smart windows with switchable optical behavior. Reverse photochromism is successfully realized by the combination of supramolecular films and spiropyrans. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sun, rain, and clouds.

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined XANES and NAP XPS study shows that Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation up to 773&#8197;K in the presence of oxygen. A theoretical model reveals that adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;O2 system is presented.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773&#8197;K, even in the presence of 0.15&#8197;mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation states of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolation of the first crystal structures of Pu(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O and Th(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O has resulted in the identification of a previously unreported change in oxalate coordination and the presence of two coordinated water molecules. This structure was determined to persist across the actinide(IV) series: Th, U, Np, and Pu.







Abstract
Plutonium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Pu(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; PuOx) is an important intermediate in the recovery of plutonium from used nuclear fuel. Its formation by precipitation is well studied, yet its crystal structure remains unknown. Instead, the crystal structure of PuOx is assumed to be isostructural with neptunium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Np(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; NpOx) and uranium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (U(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; UOx) despite the high degree of unresolved disorder that exists when determining water positions in the crystal structures of the latter two compounds. Such assumptions regarding the isostructural behavior of the actinide elements have been used to predict the structure of PuOx for use in a wide range of studies. Herein, we report the first crystal structures for PuOx and Th(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O (ThOx). These data, along with new characterization of UOx and NpOx, have resulted in the full determination of the structures and resolution of the disorder around the water molecules. Specifically, we have identified the coordination of two water molecules with each metal center, which necessitates a change in oxalate coordination mode from axial to equatorial that has not been reported in the literature. The results of this work exemplify the need to revisit previous assumptions regarding fundamental actinide chemistry, which are heavily relied upon within the current nuclear field.

         <title>Superhydrophilic and superaerophobic Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide achieves efficient hydrogen evolution over all pH ranges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing an effective, binder&#8208;free, and super&#8208;wetting electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at full pH is essential for the creation of clean hydrogen. In this study, the Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide (Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH) catalyst was prepared by spontaneous redox reaction. The chemical interaction between Ru NPs and NiCo&#8208;BH by the Ru&#8208;O&#8208;M (M=Ni, Co) interface bond, the electron&#8208;rich Ru active site, and the multi&#8208;channel nickel foam carrier make the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface advantageous for mass transfer in the HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68&#160;and 80 mV, and 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes respectively. This work provides a reference for the rational development of universal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in the all pH ranges through simple design strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations of the Photothermal Properties of a Series of Molecular Gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) Complexes Absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;III window (1550 &#8208; 1870 nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600 nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared. To test their applicability in water, these hydrophobic complexes have been encapsulated into nanoparticles constituted by amphiphilic block&#8208;copolymers. Stable suspensions of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes have been prepared which show a diameter around 100 nm. The encapsulation rate was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the dithiolene ligands. The photothermal properties of the aqueous suspensions containing gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes were then studied under 1600 nm laser irradiation. These studies demonstrate that water has strong photothermal activity in the NIR&#8208;III region that, cannot be overcome even with the addition of gold complexes displaying good photothermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon and Germanium Functionalized Perylene Diimides &#8211; Synthesis, Optoelectronic Properties, and their Application as Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused&#8208;ring non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few synthesis steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis. In these molecules, the semi&#8208;metals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to non&#8208;substituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide&#8208;based solar cells recorded to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(II) Polypyridyl Complexes: Precursors to High Valent Mn(V)=O Species and Inhibitors of Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative Mn(V)=O species at RT. The proposed Mn(V)=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Clsalicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Mystery of COVID&#8208;19 Pathogenesis: Spike Protein and Cu Can Synergize to Trigger ROS Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus's spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549 cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus's spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Driven Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylative C&#8722;N Coupling: Scope and Mechanism
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carboxylative Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination is disclosed herein under mild conditions of temperature and under atmospheric pressure of CO2. The key to success is the use of a dual strategy organophotocatalysis/nickel catalysis under visible light irradiation. The developed conditions demonstrated high functional group tolerance toward (hetero)aryl iodide and bromide. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic investigations including stoichiometric reactions and DFT calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Herein we disclosed an unprecedented photochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboxylative Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination to access a wide range of aryl carbamate derivatives. This reaction is performed under mild condition of temperature and atmospheric pressure of CO2 starting from commercially available (hetero)aryl iodides/bromides derivatives and alkyl amines preventing the formation of hazardous and/or toxic waste. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigations including stochiometric experiments as well as DFT calculations allow us to shed light on the reaction mechanism.

         <title>First Example of 1,2,5&#8208;Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Hypergolic Ionic Liquids: A New Class of Potential Energetic Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid energy: a novel type of promising thermally stable energetic fuels incorporating 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and explosophoric anions is reported for the first time. Prepared materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen content and high heats of explosion retaining low sensitivity to impact which enables their strong potential for various applications.







Abstract
The development of liquid energetic fuels with improved properties is an important topic in space propulsion technologies. In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219&#8201;&#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8211;1.47&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3). Advantageously, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (up to 64.4&#8201;%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2&#8208;hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.

         <title>Direction Switching and Self&#8208;Recovering Mechanochromic Luminescence of Anthracene&#8208;Modified o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic luminescence of bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;anthracene triad is described. By introducing ethynylene spacers, the direction of luminescence wavelength shift was changed. Recrystallization of ground samples occur even at room temperature and then the self&#8208;recovery of emission color can be observed.







Abstract
Luminochromic behaviors regarding mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;modified anthracene derivatives are reported. We have previously synthesized bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;substituted anthracene and found that its crystal polymorphs show dual&#8208;emission properties composed of excimer and charge transfer (CT) emission bands in the solid state. Initially, we observed the bathochromic MCL behavior from 1&#8201;a originating from emission mechanism alteration from dual emission to CT emission. By inserting the ethynylene spacers between anthracene and o&#8208;carboranes, compound 2 was obtained. Interestingly, 2 showed hypsochromic MCL originating from the emission mechanism alteration from CT to excimer emission. Furthermore, luminescent color of ground 1&#8201;a can be recovered to the initial state by allowing to stand at room temperature, meaning that self&#8208;recovery proceeds. Detailed analyses are described in this study.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Simplified Ansellone Analogues with Lipophilic Side Chains as HIV Latency&#8208;Reversing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural simplification of ansellone A (1), which acts as an HIV latency&#8208;reversing agent (LRA), was investigated, and two analogues, 4&#8201;i and 4&#8201;j, showed HIV&#8208;latency&#8208;reversing activity comparable to compound 1.







Abstract
Structurally simplified analogues of ansellone A, in which the decalin skeleton is replaced with a lipophilic chain, were prepared and their HIV latency&#8208;reversing activities biologically evaluated. In particular, two analogues bearing ether and alkenyl side chains, respectively, showed comparable activities to that of ansellone A. Each of the simplified compounds was easily synthesized using Prins cyclisation chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Bonding of Molecular Heavier Beryllium Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of a beryllium(I) radical with E2Ph2 (E=S, Se, Te) and of a beryllole with HEPh (E=S, Se) yield the corresponding beryllium phenylchalcogenides, including the first structurally authenticated beryllium selenide and telluride complexes. Calculations show that their Be&#8722;E bonds are best described as ionic, with Coulombic forces accounting for 56&#8201;% of the attraction and orbital interactions dominated by the &#963; component.







Abstract
The reactions of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized beryllium radical with E2Ph2 (E=S, Se, Te) and of a beryllole with HEPh (E=S, Se) yield the corresponding beryllium phenylchalcogenides, including the first structurally authenticated beryllium selenide and telluride complexes. Calculations show that their Be&#8722;E bonds are best described by the interaction between the Be+ and E&#8722; fragments, with Coulombic forces accounting for ca. 55&#8201;% of the attraction and orbital interactions dominated by the &#963; component.

Two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions are used to synthesize m6A RNA Methyltransferase bisubstrates. Our method involves copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide iodo&#8208;cycloaddition (iCuAAC) followed by palladium&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling to obtain bisubstrates containing a SAM analogue (ASAM) linked to adenosine, dinucleotide or pentamer mimicking the RNA substrate (Asub). Docking studies revealed stabilizing interactions between the triazole linker and the enzyme.







Abstract
RNA methyltransferases (RNA MTases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of RNA using the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine. While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N&#8208;6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the &#945;&#8208;amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide iodo&#8208;cycloaddition (iCuAAC) reaction afforded the 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole which was functionalized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling to connect the &#945;&#8208;amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate. The synthetic method developed here enhances the structural diversity of bisubstrate analogues to explore the active site of RNA modification enzymes and to develop new inhibitors.

While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N-6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition-metal-catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the &#945;-amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, a copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide iodo-cycloaddition (iCuAAC) reaction afforded the 5-iodo-1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole which was functionalized by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling to connect the &#945;-amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the &#945;-amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate.

         <title>Lanthanide Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks Hybrid Materials for Luminescence Responsive Chemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hybrid materials embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with cooperative emission with energy transfer and discrete one without energy transfer. The summary is focused on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and the relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess several unique features of structural and functional chemistry, together with other modular photophysical performance, which make them candidates for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Lanthanide (Ln3+) functionalized COFs hybrid materials still keep the parent COFs&#8217; virtues and also embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with both COFs and Ln3+ ions or other guest species. In this review, the summary is highlighted on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and their relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. It is subdivided into five sections involving the three main topics. Firstly, the basic knowledges of COFs materials related to the luminescence responsive chemical sensing are introduced (including three sections), involving the chemistry, application and post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of COFs, the luminescence and luminescence responsive chemical sensing, and the luminescence responsive chemical sensing of non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids materials. Secondly, the systematic progresses are outlined on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials in luminescence responsive chemical sensing, which is the emphasis for this review. Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given.

         <title>Spin Crossover and Fluorine&#8208;Specific Interactions in Metal Complexes of Terpyridines with Polyfluorocarbon Tails</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with terpyridine ligands containing PFC tails are reported. All complexes are redox rich. The cobalt(II) complexes display spin crossover, and the magnetic properties in those cases are dependent on the length of the PFC tail. Fluorine&#8208;specific interactions are observed between the PFC tails, and this effect translates into exchange narrowing of the corresponding EPR spectra of the cobalt complexes.







Abstract
In coordination chemistry and materials science, terpyridine ligands are of great interest, due to their ability to form stable complexes with a broad range of transition metal ions. We report three terpyridine ligands containing different perfluorocarbon (PFC) tails on the backbone and the corresponding FeII and CoII complexes. The CoII complexes display spin crossover close to ambient temperature, and the nature of this spin transition is influenced by the length of the PFC tail on the ligand backbone. The electrochemical properties of the metal complexes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry revealing one oxidation and several reduction processes. The fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were investigated by EPR measurements. Analysis of the EPR spectra of the complexes as microcrystalline powders and in solution reveals exchange&#8208;narrowed spectra without resolved hyperfine splittings arising from the 59Co nucleus; this suggests complex aggregation in solution mediated by interactions of the PFC tails. Interestingly, addition of perfluoro&#8208;octanol in different ratios to the acetonitrile solution of the sample resulted in the disruption of the F
F interactions of the tails. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of fluorine&#8208;specific interactions in metal complexes through EPR spectroscopy, as exemplified by exchange narrowing.

         <title>Oxidative NHC Catalysis: An Unconventional Tool for Macrocyclic Oligoesters Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs) are synthesized through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition, starting from commercial dialdehydes and diols, avoiding the use of toxic acyl chlorides. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers, synthesizing a series of synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis.







Abstract
The application of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition to the polycondensation of dialdehydes and diols is herein presented as an alternative, atom&#8208;economical synthetic route to macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). The disclosed protocol paves the way to the straightforward access to MCOs, starting from commercial dialdehydes, avoiding the use of toxic diacyl chlorides, commonly employed in traditional MCOs synthetic processes. The method is totally metal&#8208;free, takes place in the green Me&#8208;THF solvent and requires the use of a fully recyclable quinone oxidant. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers such as 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), and isomannide, synthesizing a series of novel and known synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis, with product yields (51&#8211;86&#8201;%) comparable to those obtained by traditional synthetic routes. Finally, to emphasize the synthetic relevance of the target macrocycles, an entropically&#8208;driven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) key study has been performed, optimizing the organocatalyzed synthesis of poly(2,5&#8208;furan&#8208;dimethylene 2,5 furandicarboxylate) (PBHMF) with number&#8208;average molecular weight up to 8200&#8197;g mol&#8722;1 and 66&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Synthesis of Neuraminidase&#8208;Resistant Sialyllactose Mimetics from N&#8208;Acyl Mannosamines using Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyllactose mimetics showing lectin affinity but resistant to neuraminidase hydrolysis were produced on a gram scale from N&#8208;acyl&#8208;mannosamines using metabolically engineered E. coli cells.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new Escherichia coli strains co&#8208;expressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10&#8201;% and 39&#8201;% (200&#8208;700&#8197;mg.L&#8722;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8722;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.

We designed new &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains co-expressing sialic acid synthase and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; together with the &#945;2,3-sialyltransferase from &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; or the &#945;2,6-sialyltransferase from &lt;i&gt;Photobacterium&lt;/i&gt; sp. JT-ISH-224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;propanoyl (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Prop)&lt;i&gt;, N-&lt;/i&gt;butanoyl (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-But) and &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;phenylacetyl (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10&#8201;% and 39&#8201;% (200-700&#8197;mg.L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of culture). The three &#945;2,6-sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for &lt;i&gt;Sambucus nigra&lt;/i&gt; SNA&#8722;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt; neuraminidase. These &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti-adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical Issues of Vanadium&#8208;Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn2+&#160;with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium&#8208;based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures. However, their long&#8208;term cycling stability is unsatisfactory because of material dissolution, phase transformation, and restrictive kinetics in aqueous electrolytes, which limits their practical applications. Different from previous reviews on ZIBs, this review specifically addresses the critical issues faced by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes for practical aqueous ZIBs and proposes potential solutions. Focusing on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, their ion storage mechanisms, the critical parameters affecting their performance, and the progress made in addressing the aforementioned problems are also summarized. Finally, future directions for the development of practical aqueous ZIB are suggested.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The crotylation reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;F, &#945;&#8208;OBz and &#945;&#8208;OH aldehydes under Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich conditions using (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;crotylboronates and primary amines resulted in &#947;&#8208;addition products in high dr and high er. &#945;&#8208;F and &#945;&#8208;OBz aldehydes gave 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn and 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;anti, products, respectively while an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde gave 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn products. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions of the former aldehydes can be explained using a six&#8208;membered ring transition state (TS) model in which a Cornforth&#8208;like conformation around the imine intermediate is favoured resulting in 1,2&#8208;anti products. The 2,3&#8208;stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open&#8208;TS involving H&#8208;bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;&#8208;OH group and the imine N atom. Representative products were converted to highly functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridines and 3H&#8208;oxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;ones which will be valuable scaffolds in synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Face&#8208;Capped Octahedra in a Tetrahedra Network &#8211; Structure Determination and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy of SrAl5P4N10O2F3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates show a rich structural chemistry, which can be further extended by incorporating cations in higher coordinated positions, e.g., in octahedral voids or by substituting the nitrogen atoms in the network with other anions. Following this approach, SrAl5P4N10O2F3 was synthesized at high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure conditions using a multianvil press (1400 &#176;C, 5 GPa) starting from Sr(N3)2, c&#8208;PON, P3N5, AlN, and NH4F. SrAl5P4N10O2F3 crystallizes in space group I[[EQUATION]]m2 with a = 11.1685(2) and c = 7.84850(10) &#197;. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) indicates atom assignments, which are further corroborated by bond&#8208;valence sum (BVS) calculations. Ten Al3+&#8208;centered octahedra form a highly condensed tetra&#8208;face&#8208;capped octahedra&#8208;based unit that is a novel structure motif in network compounds. A network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra and chains of face&#8208;sharing Sr2+&#8208;centered cuboctahedra complement the structure. Eu2+&#8208;doped SrAl5P4N10O2F3 shows blue emission (&#955;em = 469 nm, fwhm = 98 nm; 4504 cm&#8211;1) when irradiated with UV light.</dc:description>

         <title>Neighboring&#8208;group Participation by C&#8208;2 Acyloxy Groups:&#160; Influence of the Nucleophile and Acyl Group on the Stereochemical Outcome of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A single acyloxy group at C&#8208;2 can control the outcome of nucleophilic substitution reactions of pyran&#8208;derived acetals, but the extent of the neighboring&#8208;group participation depends on a number of factors. We show here that neighboring&#8208;group participation does not necessarily control the stereochemical outcome of acetal substitution reactions with weak nucleophiles. The 1,2&#8208;trans selectivity increased with increasing reactivity of the incoming nucleophile. This trend suggests the intermediacy of both cis&#8208;fused dioxolenium ions and oxocarbenium ions in the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step. In addition, as the electron&#8208;donating ability of the neighboring group decreased, the preference for the 1,2&#8208;trans products increased. Computational studies show how the barriers for the ring&#8208;opening reaction on the dioxolenium ions and the transition states to provide the oxocarbenium ions change with the electron&#8208;donating capacity of the C&#8208;2&#8208;acyl group and the reactivity of the nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Trityl&#8208;Based Lanthanide&#8208;Supramolecular Assemblies Exhibiting Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Trityl&#8208;appended mono&#8208; (HL1) and bis&#8208;compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1&#8208;4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non-covalent interactions. Trityl-appended mono- (HL1) and bis-compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1-4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1&#8211;6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1-4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotropic axes and corroborated magnetic relaxation mechanisms to be a combination of Raman and quantum tunnelling in zero dc field, the latter being cancelled in the optimum non-zero dc field. Our work represents the first study of magneto-structural correlations within the trityl Ln-SMMs, leading to generation of slowly relaxing zero-field dysprosium complexes within the hydrogen bonded assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Mediated H&#8208;Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes for Effective Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal&#8208;coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal&#8208;organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal&#8208;coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H&#8208;aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe2+ or Mn2+). Moreover, the extent of H&#8208;aggregates varied with different metal&#8208;coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2&#8208;&#183;) upon light irradiation. And the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8208;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/ Cu(II)&#8208;mediated condition. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, while the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8722;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet states for the C(3) and C(4)&#8722;product formation. This subsequently reinforces the role of energetics in dictating the observed regioselectivity. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction of Low&#8208;Cost Stainless Steel Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a simple and reasonable method to convert inexpensive 434&#8208;L SS (stainless steel) into cost&#8208;effective and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfidation strategies. Systematic characterization shows that sulfidization treatment is beneficial to improve the oxygen evolution reaction activity of stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts, and provides an effective method to the design cheap and robust catalysts.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the production of hydrogen fuel from water splitting. Low&#8208;cost and efficient stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts are expected to replace the scarce platinum group metals for large&#8208;scale energy applications. Here in this work, we report the conversion of commonly available inexpensive and easily accessible 434&#8208;L stainless steel (SS) into highly active and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfuration strategies. The NixFe1&#8722;xS layer as a pre&#8208;catalyst and S&#8208;doped NixFe oxyhydroxides in&#8197;situ formed on the catalyst surface are the true active species for OER. The optimized 434&#8208;L stainless steel&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 298&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH with a small OER kinetics (the Tafel slope of 54.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and good stability. This work reveals the 434&#8208;L alloy stainless steel with Fe and Cr as the main elements can be used as qualified OER catalysts by surface modification, along with a new mentality to solve the energy and resource waste problems.

         <title>Sulfur Dioxide Oxidation by Zinc and Zinc Oxide Nitrate/Nitrite Complexes in the Gas Phase: An Interplay between Redox&#8208;Active Ligands and Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready for oxidation. Sulfur dioxide has been prepared for fast and efficient intracomplex oxidation by oxygen ion transfer from a [Zn2+&#8208;O&#8901;&#8722;]+ core or by electron transfer from the low&#8208;valence Zn+ of zinc and zinc oxide nitrate/nitrite complexes. The nitrogen oxyanionic ligands continue the process, forming sulfate or sulfite as the ending oxidation products.







Abstract
Different oxidative pathways of sulfur dioxide promoted by ZnO(NO3)2&#8722;, Zn(NO3)2&#8722; and Zn(NO2)(NO3)&#8722; are revealed by a joint investigation by mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. The reactions are triggered by [Zn2+&#8208;O&#8722;&#8901;]+ or by the low&#8208;valence Zn+ through oxygen ion transfer or electron transfer to SO2, respectively. The NOx&#8722; ligands intervene in the oxidation only when sulfur dioxide is converted to SO3&#8722; or SO2&#8722;, leading to the formation of zinc sulfate and zinc sulfite coordinated to nitrate or nitrite anions. Kinetic analyses show that the reactions are fast and efficient, and theory discloses the elementary steps, namely oxygen ion transfer, oxygen atom transfer and electron transfer, occurring through similar energy landscapes for the three reactive anions.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Toluene Oxidation through a Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ambient conditions, toluene can be oxidized selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. A peroxido copper complex is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. No&#223;, R. G&#246;ttlich, and S. Schindler (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301142).

A diastereomeric mixture of antlers (compounds (SP)&#8208;9 and (RP)&#8208;9) cannot be separated while attached to the deer. In winter, however, the deer will lose the single antler&#8208;diastereomers, and they can be resolved and collected to provide a robust starting material for (chiral) tools, like spears, axes or homogeneous catalysts. Note the useful enantiomerically pure (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;containing food (Mentha arvensis) available for the deer. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300790). Cover designed by Dr. Christoph Selg.

         <title>Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover shows a series of our single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. Constructing symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause nonradiative transitions is the key to creating small, yet brightly emitting, fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety has proven to be an effective core architecture to realize single&#8208;benzene yellow fluorophores. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301411).

         <title>Strong Chiroptical Effects in the Absorption and Emission of Macrocycles Based on the 2,5&#8208;Diaminoterephthalate Minimal Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral macrocycles composed of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate units (n = 2&#8211;4) can be synthesised in a simple one&#8208;pot reaction. All products exhibit fluorescence in solution and in the solid state that is dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring&#8212;the smaller the macrocycle, the longer the emission wavelength. The macrocycles show strong chiroptical activity, with the trimer showing particularly high dissymmetry factors in ECD and CPL spectra. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. G&#243;recki, M. Grzybowski and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300932).

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8208;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Here, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serves as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community&#160;in silico&#160;in single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydration Rearrangement in the 4&#8208;Aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 Cluster Induced by Photoionization: The Effect of Solvent&#8208;Solvent Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydration dynamics and the role of water&#8208;water interaction at the single&#8208;molecule level. Excess energy dependence of IR spectra of the isolated 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster reveals that photoionization initiates the migration of an intact water dimer from the CN site to the NH site.







Abstract
The interplay between solute&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions plays an essential role in solvation dynamics that has important effects on the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In this study, the rearrangement of the hydration shell induced by photoionization of a solute molecule is probed in a state&#8208; and isomer&#8208;specific manner by resonant multiphoton ionization detected IR spectroscopy of the prototypical 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster produced in a molecular beam. IR spectra reveal that the water molecules form a cyclic solvent network around the CN group in the initial neutral state (S0). Different from the singly&#8208;hydrated cluster, in which either the CN or the NH2 group is hydrated, hydration of the NH2 group is not observed in the dihydrated cluster. IR spectra obtained after ionizing the solute molecule into the cation ground state (D0) exhibit features ascribed to both NH&#8208;bound and CN&#8208;bound isomers, indicating that water molecules migrate from the CN to the NH site upon ionization with a yield depending on the ionization excess energy. Analysis of the IR spectra as a function of the excess energy shows that migration produces two different NH2 solvated structures, namely (i) the most stable structure in which both N&#8722;H bonds are singly hydrated and (ii) the second most stable isomer in which one of the N&#8722;H bonds is hydrated by a H&#8208;bonded (H2O)2 dimer. The product branching ratio of the two isomers depends on the excess energy. The role of the water&#8208;water interaction in the hydration rearrangement is discussed based on the potential energy landscape. Solvation dynamics plays an important role in reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, where not only solute&#8208;solvent solvation but also solvent&#8208;solvent interactions have a significant influence on the dynamics. Thus, the investigation of solvation dynamics at the molecular level substantially contributes to our understanding of the reaction mechanism. In this study, the dihydrated cluster of 4ABN was utilized as a model for the first solvation layer to elucidate solvent motions induced by ionization of the solute and the role of W&#8722;W interactions for the solvent relaxation.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Ligated MgI&#8722;MgI&#8208;Bonded Compound with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse reaction types: Reactions of dimagnesium(I) [LMg&#8722;MgL] (L=&#945;&#8208;diimine) with carbodiimides proceed via four pathways: 1) Release of one Me3Si of Me3SiNCNSiMe3 to yield either bridging or mononuclear complexes; 2) N=C=N insertion into the Mg&#8722;Mg bond; 3) coupling of two carbodiimides; and 4) double insertion of carbodiimides into a Mg&#8722;C bond to form an alkyne&#8208;bridged bis(amidinate) [(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2]2&#8722;.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated dimagnesium(I) compound [K(thf)3]2[LMg&#8722;MgL] (1, L=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)]22&#8722;) displays diverse reactivities toward carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) with different R substituents. In the reaction of 1 with Me3SiNCNSiMe3, one of the easily leaving trimethylsilyl groups is lost to yield the Me3SiNCN&#8722; moiety that either bridges two MgII centers (2) or terminally coordinated (3). In contrast, with the similarly bulky tBuNCNtBu, the carbodiimide inserts into Mg&#8722;Mg bond with accompanying C&#8722;H activation of a ligand or solvent (products 4 and 5). In the case of dicyclohexyl or diisopropyl carbodiimide, reductive C&#8722;C coupling of two RNCNR molecules occurs to form the [C2(NR)4]2&#8722; diamido moiety, which bridges two Mg centers, giving complexes [{K(dme)2}2LMg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL] (6, R=Cy; 7, R=iPr) and [L&#8901;&#8722;Mg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL&#8901;&#8722;] (8). Most interestingly, upon treating 1 with Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3, the acetylide complex [K(dme)][LMg(C&#8801;CSiMe3)(dme)] (9) was prepared, which undergoes a rare &#8220;double insertion&#8221; with CyNCNCy to afford [K(solv)][K(dme)2LMg(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2MgL] (10) containing an acetylenediide&#8208;coupled bis(amidinate) ligand that bridges two Mg atoms.

         <title>Cooperatively Catalyzed Activation of Thioglycosides That Bypasses Intermediacy of Glycosyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the activation of thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate by using a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine is reported. Application of the H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method lead to an enhanced stereocontrol.







Abstract
Reported herein is the development of a novel method for activating thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate. This has been achieved through the use of a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine. The enhanced stereocontrol was achieved via the H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method, and the extended trisaccharide synthesis was achieved via iteration of deprotection and glycosylation steps.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with dibenzodioxin linkage have been reviewed in terms of monomer design based on a wide range of rigid and contorted scaffolds, syntheses, properties, and their applications to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, which is crucial for tailoring the properties.







Abstract
The development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades has established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and the soluble nature of glassy polymers. Due to their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that potentially find application in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger's base, and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, most of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds are discussed, as well as synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, the prospects of these materials are examined with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs is analyzed, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of (Hetero)Arenes Using Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in the skeletal editing of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with an emphasis on the scope, reactivity, selectivity, and general mechanistic considerations. The impressive breadth of application of this strategy in both drug discovery and total synthesis is also discussed. Existing challenges and perspectives on future research directions to further understanding and new reaction developments are outlined.







Abstract
(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews on peripheral editing (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editings via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations have received less attention in the review literature. In this review, we systematically summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and their applications in natural product syntheses. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies are also highlighted.

         <title>Effect of Polymeric Ligand Grafting Region on Confined Assembly of Gold Nanorods in cylindrical nanopores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polystyrene end&#8208;tethered gold nanorod (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefer to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly in cylindrical nanopores.







Abstract
The grafting region of polymeric ligands exhibit a significant influence on the assembly behavior of polymer tethered gold nanorods (AuNRs) in confined space. In this work, the effect of core size, molecular weight and grafting region of ligands on the assembly structure in cylindrical nanopores was investigated. It is found that polystyrene end&#8208;tethered AuNR (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on the entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology that gradually transforms into a spherical shape as the molecular weight increases. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form special structures such as inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefers to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly. The confinement effect was studied as well by varying the diameter of pores. The results show that the nanoparticles prefer to arrange into a regular and ordered assembly structure in the strong confinement spaces. Under the synergy of confined spaces and ligands at both ends, the AuNRs@End&#8722;PS are more likely to form a tilted order&#8208;assembly structure. The results of this work could provide new ideas and guidance for the preparation of ordered assembly of AuNRs with novel structures.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCl transport mediated by amphiphilic peptides that structurally resemble lipids is described. Carboxylate and amide NH groups in the scaffold facilitate ion&#8208;pair transport across the membrane by carrier mechanism.







Abstract
Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimmetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provide a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+&gt;Cl&#8722;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity, and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu single metal atoms anchored on black phosphorus are designed as efficient and low&#8208;price catalysts for converting methane to methanol. First&#8208;principles calculations show that Cu@BP exhibits the best methane activation performance through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable methanol is a great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8722;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, single transition metal atoms (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offers excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides was achieved using glycerol as the biomass reducing reagent, water as the solvent, TiO2 as the photocatalyst, and solar light as the light and thermal energy source.







Abstract
Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under mild conditions with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is an important chemical procedure. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. Therefore, a TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol are suitable components of this type of reaction. Stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO was thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.&#8201;e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photocatalytic deprotection&lt;/b&gt; of pyridine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides was achieved using glycerol as the biomass reducing reagent, water as the solvent, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the photocatalyst, and solar light as the light and thermal energy source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deprotection of pyridine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides under mild conditions with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is an important chemical procedure. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. Therefore, a TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst and glycerol are suitable components of this type of reaction. Stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved, with only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO was thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.&#8201;e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
