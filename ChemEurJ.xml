      <dc:description>Unexpected inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking was observed in the order&#8211;disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)  2  (abco)  2  ] (  1  ; M = Co  2+  ,  2  ; Ni  2+  , acac  &#8722;  = 2,4&#8208;pentanedionato, abco = 1&#8208;azabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]&#8208;octane = quinuclidine) during heating. The isostructural, transition&#8208;free complexes [M(acac)  2  (cabco)  2  ] (  3  ; M = Co  2+  ,  4  ; Ni  2+  , cabco = 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]&#8208;octane = 3&#8208;chloroquinuclidine) were also studied for comparison. Complexes  1  and  2  crystallized in ordered phases in the centrosymmetric  I  2/  m  space group at 100 K, whereas they crystallized in disordered phases in the non&#8208;symmetric  I  2 space group at 300 K. The 60&#176; step rotation disordering of the abco ligands was observed in the electron density maps of  1  and  2  , which was consistent with the transition enthalpies estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gradual phase transitions were observed for  1  and  2  by DSC and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) at approximately 225 K. The inversion&#8208;symmetry disordering was likely induced by the local pseudo&#8208;symmetry of the abco ligands, increasing from trigonal to hexagonal and the increased steric repulsion pathways among them.</dc:description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Size&#8208;Controlled Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanosphere Supported Ultrafine Ru Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation of Quinolines</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft templating: Nitrogen&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanosphere (NMCS) with tunable sizes and uniform mesoporosity is synthesized by a facile soft&#8208;templating method, whereby F127 (PEO&#8211;PPO&#8211;PEO triblock copolymer) can be used not only as a soft template to generate the mesostructure but also as a size&#8208;control agent to tailor the size of NMCS ranging from 100 to 700&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanosphere (NMCS) with tunable sizes and uniform mesoporosity was synthesized by a facile soft&#8208;templating method. During the synthesis, F127 (PEO&#8211;PPO&#8211;PEO triblock copolymer) could be used not only as a soft template to generate the mesostructure but also as a size&#8208;control agent to tailor the size of NMCS in a relatively wide range of 100 to 700&#8197;nm. In addition, the synthesis process was simple and suitable for large&#8208;scale production. Moreover, the NMCS was used as support of ultrafine Ru nanoparticles (Ru/NMCS), which exhibited good catalytic performances for selective hydrogenation of quinolones. It is expected that the simple synthetic strategy for the NMCS can generate extensive interest in many catalysis and sorption applications.

The Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) was employed as a new reaction in kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS).

      <title>Construction of helical structures with multiple fused anthracenes: structures and properties of long expanded helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic compounds consisting of four or five fused anthracene units were synthesized by PtCl  2  &#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization as novel long expanded helicenes. These compounds have helical structures with significant stacking of the terminal anthracene moieties at 0.33 nm interlayer distance. In the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra, the absorption and emission bands were red&#8208;shifted as the number of fused anthracene units was increased. The characteristic broad and long&#8208;lived emission bands of the long analogs are explained by the excimer&#8208;like stabilization of the excited state. These photophysical data as well as their cyclic voltammetric data are discussed on the basis of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interlayer &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions in the molecular structures and the molecular orbitals.

      <title>Aromatic Aza&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement of Arylpropargylammonium Salts Generated in Situ from Arynes and Tertiary Propargylamines</title>
      <dc:description>The charge&#8208;accelerated aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of ammonium salts serves as a key step in the construction of complex nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. In contrast to the aliphatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, much less attention has been paid to the aromatic one. Herein, we report an unprecedented aromatic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of arylpropargylammonium salts, generated in situ from arynes and tertiary propargylamines, delivering structurally diverse 2&#8208;propargylanilines in moderate to good yields with high regioselectivity. This rearrangement proceeds in the absence of strong bases and transition metals, is compatible with moisture and air, tolerates a wide variety of functional groups, and is amenable to form eleven&#8208; to thirteen&#8208;membered heterocycles embedded with a triple bond. The 2&#8208;propargylaniline products were treated with aluminum chloride in ethanol to afford multisubstituted indoles in moderate to excellent yields.

      <title>A xanthene&#8208;based mono&#8208;anionic PON ligand: exploiting a bulky, electronically unsymmetrical donor in Main Group chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a novel mono&#8208;anionic phosphino&#8208;amide ligand based on a xanthene backbone is reported, together with the corresponding Ga(I) complex, (PON)Ga (PON = 4&#8208;(di(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phosphino)&#8208;5&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;  tert&#8208;  butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene). The solid&#8208;state structure of (PON)Ga (obtained from X&#8208;ray crystallography) reveals very weak O&#183;&#183;&#183;Ga and P&#183;&#183;&#183;Ga interactions, consistent with a R  2  NGa fragment that closely resembles those found in one&#8208;coordinate amidogallium systems. Strong N&#8208;to&#8208;Ga &#960; donation from the amido substituent is reflected in a very short N&#8208;Ga distance (1.976(4) &#197;), while the P&#183;&#183;&#183;Ga contact (3.078(2) &#197;) is well outside the sum of the respective covalent radii. While the donor properties of the PON ligand towards Ga(I) are highly unsymmetrical, oxidation to Ga(III) leads to much stronger coordination of the pendant phosphine as shown by P&#8208;Ga distances which are up to 20% shorter. From a steric perspective, the PON ligand is shown to be significantly bulkier than related &#946;&#8208;diketiminate systems, a finding consistent with reactions of (PON)Ga towards O&#8208;atom sources that proceed without oligomerization. Despite this, the enhanced P&#8208;donor properties brought about by oxidation at gallium are not sufficient to quench the reactivity of the highly polar Ga&#8208;O unit. Instead, intramolecular benzylic C&#8208;H activation is observed across the Ga&#8208;O bond of a transient gallanone intermediate.</dc:description>

</title>
      <dc:description>
Two armed and ready! A two armed, thus rigid, GdIII&#8208;CLaNP13 probe for double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on proteins can be used to measure nanometer distances in cells with high precision.







Abstract
The application of double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) with site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL) to measure distances in proteins and protein complexes in living cells puts rigorous restraints on the spin&#8208;label. The linkage and paramagnetic centers need to resist the reducing conditions of the cell. Rigid attachment of the probe to the protein improves precision of the measured distances. Here, three two&#8208;armed GdIII complexes, GdIII&#8208;CLaNP13a/b/c were synthesized. Rather than the disulfide linkage of most other CLaNP molecules, a thioether linkage was used to avoid reductive dissociation of the linker. The doubly GdIII labeled N55C/V57C/K147C/T151C variants of T4Lysozyme were measured by 95&#8197;GHz DEER. The constructs were measured in vitro, in cell lysate and in Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Measured distances were 4.5&#8197;nm, consistent with results from paramagnetic NMR. A narrow distance distribution and typical modulation depth, also in cell, indicate complete and durable labeling and probe rigidity due to the dual attachment sites.

Study on luminescent properties of  1  and  2  reveals that the quantum yield of  1  itself basically keeps unchanged in  2  . Significantly, the formation of  2  can not only effectively prevent the cluster  1  from aggregation, but also greatly enhance its solubility and adhesion to the substrate.

      <title>Light&#8208;Driven Syngas Production over Defective ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic syngas (CO and H2) production with CO2 as gas source not only ameliorates greenhouse effect, but also produces valuable chemical feedstocks. However, traditional photocatalytic system requires noble metal or suffers from low yield. Here, we demonstrate that S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets are an ideal photocatalyst to drive CO2 reduction into syngas. It is found that building S vacancies can endow ZnIn2S4 with stronger photoabsorption, efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, and larger CO2 adsorption, finally promoting both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The syngas yield of CO and H2 is therefore significantly increased. In contrast to pristine ZnIn2S4, the syngas yield over VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can be improved by roughly ~4.73 times and the CO/H2 ratio is modified from 1:4.18 to 1:1. Total amount of syngas after 12 h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20 mmol g&#8211;1 without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn2S4 for light&#8208;driven syngas production.</dc:description>

      <title>How to Build Prussian Blue&#8208;Based Water Oxidation Catalytic Assemblies? Common Trends and Strategies</title>
      <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have at least a three&#8208;century long history in coordination chemistry. Recently, cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts. Given the flexibility in their synthesis, the structure and morphology of cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been modified for enhanced catalytic activity under electrochemical (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Here, in this review, the work on cobalt&#8208;based PBAs is presented in four sections: i) electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii) photocatalytic process in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii) photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv) the utilization of PBA&#8208;PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers on the structure &amp; catalytic activity relationship in cobalt&#8208;based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component. Furthermore, this review aims to provide insight into common strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of PBAs.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ labeling and distance measurements of membrane proteins in E. coli using Finland and OX063 trityl labels</title>
      <dc:description>In situ&#160;investigation of membrane proteins is a challenging task. Previously we demonstrated that nitroxide labels combined with pulsed ESR spectroscopy is a promising tool for this purpose. However, the nitroxide labels suffer from poor stability, high background labeling, and low sensitivity. Here we show that Finland (FTAM) and OX063 based labels enable labeling of the cobalamin transporter BtuB and BamA, the central component of the&#160;&#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, in&#160;E coli. Compared to the&#160;methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL),&#160;trityl labels eliminated the background signals and enabled specific&#160;in situ&#160;labeling of the proteins with high efficiency. The OX063 labels show a long phase memory time (TM) of&#160;~5&#160;&#956;s. All the trityls enabled distance measurements between BtuB and an orthogonally labeled substrate with high selectivity and sensitivity down to a few&#160;&#956;M concentration. Our data corroborate the BtuB and BamA conformations in the cellular environment of&#160;E. coli.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) are a relatively young family of macrocycles consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups and their unique structures have attracted extensive attention of chemists&#160;in the past decades.&#160;Due to the presence of rigid hydrophobic inside cavity and two polar outside portals lined with carbonyl groups, Q[n]s could not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters.

Furthermore, the outer surface of Q[n]s has been demonstrated to be capable to interact with definite species to generate supramolecular architectures in recent years. With the deepening of the research on Q[n]s, their application studies have also emerged as a hotspot.

      <title>Polymerization&#8208;driven photoluminescence in alkanolamine&#8208;based C&#8208;dots</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of Carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of CPD strong photoluminescence resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms.

The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed to monitor the CPD properties at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds.

      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;medium fluorophores which show significant luminescence intensity in solution and in the solid&#8208;state from two emissive forms remain scarce in the literature and can only result from a subtle balance between rigidity, planarity and solubility while avoiding detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and strong molecular motions. 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole (HBX) fluorophores are popular Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) emitters largely studied for their synthetic versatility, photostability, strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence and ability to engineer dual emission paving the way to applications as white emitters, ratiometric sensors, and cryptographic dyes. They are, however heavily quenched in solution, due to efficient non&#8208;radiative pathways taking place as a consequence of the proton transfer in the excited&#8208;state. A mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalization of the HBX scaffold with ethynyl&#8208;extended moieties was previously shown to yield enhanced brightness of the resulting dyes in solution. In this contribution, the nature of the heteroring constitutive of these rigidified HBX dyes was modified and we demonstrate that this simple structural modification triggers major optical changes in terms of emission color, dual emission engineering, and importantly, fluorescent quantum yield. Investigation of the photophysical properties in solution and in the solid&#8208;state of a series of ethynyl&#8208;TIPS extended HBX fluorophores, along with  ab initio  calculations demonstrate the very promising abilities of these dyes to act as bright dual&#8208;state emitters, in both solution and solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Europium Complexes that Switch On Luminescence in Lysosomes of Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>A set of four luminescent Eu(III) complexes bearing an extended aryl&#8208;alkynylpyridine chromophore has been studied, showing very different pH&#8208;dependent behaviour in their absorption and emission spectral response. For two complexes with p  K  a  values of 6.45 and 6.20 in protein containing solution, the emission lifetime increases very significantly following protonation. By varying the gate time during signal acquisition, the &#8216;switch&#8208;on&#8217; intensity ratio could be optimised and enhancement factors of between 250 to 1330 were measured between pH 8 and 4.&#160; The best behaved probe showed no dependence on the concentration of common endogenous cations, selected reductants and serum albumin and was examined in live cell imaging studies and used to monitor time&#8208;dependent lysosomal acidification, for which the increase in observed image brightness due to acidification was found to be a factor of 50 in NIH&#8208;3T3 cells.</dc:description>

By varying the gate time during signal acquisition, the &#8216;switch&#8208;on&#8217; intensity ratio could be optimised and enhancement factors of between 250 to 1330 were measured between pH 8 and 4.&#160; The best behaved probe showed no dependence on the concentration of common endogenous cations, selected reductants and serum albumin and was examined in live cell imaging studies and used to monitor time&#8208;dependent lysosomal acidification, for which the increase in observed image brightness due to acidification was found to be a factor of 50 in NIH&#8208;3T3 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Catalytic C&#8211;X borylation of aryl halides containing two ortho&#8208;fluorines has been found to be challenging, as most previous methods require stoichiometric amounts of base and the polyfluorinated aryl boronates suffer from protodeboronation, which is accelerated by ortho&#8208;fluorine substituents. Herein, we report that a combination of Pd(dba)2 (dba = dibenzylideneacetone) with SPhos (2&#8208;dicyclohexylphosphino&#8208;2&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl) as a ligand is efficient to catalyze the C&#8211;Cl borylation of aryl chlorides containing two ortho&#8208;fluorine substituents. This method, conducted under base&#8208;free conditions, is compatible with the resulting di&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluorinated aryl boronate products which are sensitive to base.</dc:description>

The two tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX TADF emitters were designed to have Dexter energy transfer managing blocking groups either in the donor or acceptor unit of the donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF sensitizer. The TADF materials showed small singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting and high reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate for effective sensitization of the fluorescent emission of the fluorescent emitter. The tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitized fluorescent devices showed maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17.7% and 11.5% in the yellow and red devices, respectively, which were higher than those of the TADF sensitized devices with the corresponding TADF sensitizer without the blocking group. Moreover, the device lifetime was also extended by employing the tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitizers.</dc:description>

      <title>CompassR yields highly organic solvent&#8208;tolerant enzymes through recombination of compatible substitutions</title>
      <dc:description>The CompassR rule enables to identify among beneficial substitutions the ones, which can beneficially be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from  Bacillus subtilis  lipase A (BSLA), which improve organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX) resistance, were studied to compare two recombination strategies 2GenReP and InSiReP employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX resistant variant M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K) with an up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of ~270 clones. M4 has a remarkable enhanced resistance in 60% (v/v) acetone (6.0&#8208;fold), 30% (v/v) ethanol (2.1&#8208;fold), and 60% (v/v) methanol (2.4&#8208;fold) compared to BSLA wild type. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that attracting water molecules by charged surface substitutions is the main driver for increasing the DOX resistance of BSLA M4.

      <title>The photosensitizing efficacy of micelles containing a porphyrinic photosensitizer and KI against resistant melanoma cells</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) appears as a promising alternative to overcome the resistance of melanoma to conventional therapies. Currently applied photosensitizers (PS) are often based on tetrapyrrolic macrocycles like porphyrins. Unfortunately, in some cases the use of this type of derivatives is limited due to their poor solubility in the biological environment. Feasible approaches to surpass this drawback are based on lipid formulations. Besides that, and inspired in the efficacy of potassium iodide for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), the combined effect of&#160;  1  O  2  &#160; with KI was assessed in this work, as an alternative strategy to potentiate the effect of PDT against resistant melanoma cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling structural mysteries of simple organozinc alkoxides</title>
      <dc:description>Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest on their multifaced chemistry has been driven by fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject to continuous debate. Herein, we describe the synthesis and structural characterization of long&#8208;sought structural forms, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2], incorporating diphenylmethanolate as a model alkoxide ligand. Both novel aggregates are robust in the solid state and resistant towards mechanical force. In turn, using  1H NMR and diffusion&#8208;order spectroscopy, we demonstrate that new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are kinetically labile in the solution and readily undergo ligand scrambling, such as in the case of Schlenk equilibrium. The elucidated several elusive key structural issues, which have remained undiscovered for decades, significantly advance the chemistry of RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides and should support the rational design of zinc alkoxide&#8208;based applications.</dc:description>

      <title>[Gd(AAZTA)]&#8208; derivatives with n&#8208;alkyl acid side chains show improved properties for their application as MRI contrast agents</title>
      <dc:description>Herein the synthesis and an extensive characterization of two novel Gd(AAZTA) derivatives functionalized with short (C2  and C4  )  n  &#8208;alkyl acid function are reported. The carboxylate functionality is the site for further conjugations for the design of more specific contrast agents (CAs). Interestingly it has been found that the synthetized complexes display enhanced properties for their use as MRI contrast agents by their own. The  1H&#8208;NMR spectra of the complexes with EuIII  and YbIII  displayed a set of signals consistent with half the number of methylene protons present on each ligand. The number of resonances resulted invariant over a large range of temperature to suggest the occurrence of a fast interconversion between structural isomers. The relaxivity values (298K, 20MHz) were consistent with  q  =2 being equal to 8.8 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1  for the C2  derivative and 9.4 mM&#8208;1  s&#8208;1  for the C4  one, i.e sensibly higher than the one reported for Gd(AAZTA) (7.1 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1  ). VT&#8208;  T2  17O&#8208;NMR measurements showed, for both complexes, the presence of two populations of coordinated water molecules, one in fast and one in slow exchange with the bulk water. The analysis of the  17O NMR VT&#8208;  T2  profiles vs. temperature allowed to establish their relative molar fraction being 35% for the isomer with the fast exchanging water and 65% for the isomer with the water molecules in slower exchange. Finally,  1H NMRD profiles over an extended range of applied magnetic field strengths have been satisfactory fitted on the basis of the occurrence of the two interconverting species.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The stabilizing neighboring effect of halo substituents on silyl cations was tested for a series of peri&#8208;halo substituted acenaphthyl&#8208;based silyl cations 3. The chloro&#8208; (3b), bromo&#8208; (3c) and iodo&#8208; (3d) stabilized cations were synthesized by the Corey protocol. Structural and NMR spectroscopic investigations for cations 3b&#8208;d supported by the results of density functional calculations indicate their halonium ion nature. According to the fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method, the silyl&#8208;Lewis acidity decreases along the series of halonium ions 3, the fluoronium ion 3a being a very strong and the iodoniumion 3d a moderate Lewis acid. Halonium ions 3b and 3c react with starting silanes in a substituent redistribution reaction and form siliconium ions 4b and 4c.

      <title>Long&#8208;Range LMCT Coupling in EuIII Coordination Polymers for an Effective Molecular Luminescent Thermometer</title>
      <dc:description>
A luminescent EuIII/GdIII coordination polymer with high brightness, high temperature sensitivity, and high thermo&#8208;stability is reported. The prominent luminescent properties were derived from the control of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;f orbital interactions. The conceptual design for the construction of a highly luminescent temperature&#8208;sensitive lanthanide coordination polymer opens up a new field at the interface between the fields of luminescence thermometry and molecular materials.

      <title>Boosting the Iodine Adsorption and Radioresistance of Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs via Aromatic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
Effective capture of radioactive iodine is of paramount importance for the safe and long&#8208;term storage of fission products in the nuclear fuel cycle. By adopting the ThIV cation with appropriate &#8220;hardness&#8221; as the building block, a series of functionalized Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs with high&#8208;quality single crystals were synthesized, serving as a model to investigate the effects of substituents on iodine adsorption. The electro&#8208;donating NH2 group exhibits the most positive role on boosting iodine adsorption and it can also enhance the radioresistance of the corresponding framework. More information can be found in the Communication by Z.&#8208;H. Zhang, J. Lin, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003621).

      <title>Non&#8208;Coordinated Phenolate Anions and Their Application in SF6 Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
The non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anion ([H5C6&#8208;O]&#8722; is easily accessible by deprotonation of phenol with the superbasic perethyl tetraphosphazene Schwesinger base, while monophosphazenes only deliver the hydrogen&#8208;bonded phenol&#8211;phenolate adduct. Hydrogen bonding influences the electron donation and brings about lowered redox potentials. Synthesized electron&#8208;rich non&#8208;coordinated phenolates featuring strong redox potentials are capable for the SF6 activation and lead to pentafluorosulfanide [SF5]&#8722; salts. More information can be found in the Communication by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003504).

      <title>The Missing Link in the Magnetism of Hybrid Cobalt Layered Hydroxides: The Odd&#8211;Even Effect of the Organic Spacer</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular engineering driven by the Epoxide Route facilitates the straightforward synthesis of hybrid layered CoII hydroxides covalently functionalized with dicarboxylic molecules. An unexpected modification on the magnetism that solely depends on the parity of the organic linker is reported. The acute changes in the spontaneous magnetization, from ca. 15&#8197;K to 60&#8197;K for odd and even hybrids, respectively, paves the way towards a new level of tuning in the magnetism of layered hydroxides.

      <title>In Situ Synthesis of Manganese Oxide as an Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Catalyst: A New Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
So far, all studies on oxygen&#8208;evolution reactions using Mn oxides in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) have been carried out by synthesizing Mn oxides in the first step, followed by the investigation of the Mn oxides in the presence of oxidants for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a case study of a new and promising strategy for in situ catalyst synthesis by adding MnII to a CAN solution, resulting in the formation of Mn&#8208;based catalysts for OER. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. G&#246;rlin, M.&#8197;M. Najafpour, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002942).

      <title>Investigation of luminescent triplet states in tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes: thermochromism and structural characterization</title>
      <dc:description>To develop new and flexible Cu(I) containing luminescent substances, we extend our previous investigations on two metal&#8208;centred species to four metal&#8208;centred complexes. These complexes could be a basis for designing new organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) relevant species. Both the synthesis and in&#8208;depth spectroscopic analysis, combined with high&#8208;level theoretical calculations are presented on a series of tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes with a halide containing Cu  4  X  4  core (X = iodide, bromide or chloride) and 2&#8209;(diphenylphosphino)pyridine bridging ligands with a methyl group in  para  (4&#8208;Me) or  ortho  (6&#8208;Me) position of the pyridine ring. The structure of the electronic ground state is characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and IR spectroscopy with the support of theoretical calculations. In contrast to the  para  system, the complexes with  ortho  &#8208;substituted bridging ligands show a remarkable and reversible temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence. Here, we combine for the first time the luminescence thermochromism with time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy. Thus, we receive experimental data on the structures of the two triplet states involved in the luminescence thermochromism. The transient IR spectra of the underlying triplet metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (  3  M/XLCT) and cluster&#8208;centred (  3  CC) states were obtained and interpreted by comparison with calculated vibrational spectra.

      <title>Binding motifs in the naked complexes of target amino acids with an excerpt of antitumor active biomolecule. An ion vibrational spectroscopy assay</title>
      <dc:description>The structures of proton&#8208;bound complexes of 5,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one (  1  ) and basic amino acids (AAs), namely histidine (His) and lysine (Lys) have been examined by mass spectrometry,&#160; IR ion spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. This selection of systems is founded on the fact that  1  represents a portion of Glabrescione B, a natural small molecule of promising antitumor activity, while His and Lys are protein residues lining the cavity of the alleged receptor binding site. These species are thus a model of the bioactive adduct, though obviously the isolated state of the present study bears little resemblance with the complex biological environment. Common feature of [  1  +AA+H]  +  &#160; complexes is the presence of a protonated AA bound to neutral  1  , in spite of the fact that the gas phase basicity of  1  is comparable to the one of Lys and His. The carbonyl group of  1  acts as powerful hydrogen bond acceptor. Within [  1  +AA+H]  +  &#160; the side chain substituents (imidazole group for His and terminal amino group for Lys) present comparable basic properties as the a&#8208;amino group, taking part to a cooperative H&#8208;bond network. The structural assignment, relying on the comparative analysis of the IRMPD spectrum and calculated IR spectra for the candidate geometries, derives from an examination over two frequency ranges, 900&#8208;1800 cm  &#8208;1  and 2900&#8208;3700 cm  &#8208;1  .

      <title>Tuning the organogelating and spectroscopic properties of a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;based gelator through charge transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;component organogels and xerogels based on a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;containing gelator have been deeply characterized through a wide range of techniques.

      <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Thermal Vibration&#8208;Coupled Valence Tautomeric Transition Observed in a Conductive One&#8208;Dimensional Rhodium&#8211;Dioxolene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The exploration of dynamic molecular crystals is a fascinating theme for materials scientists owing to their fundamental science and potential application to molecular devices. Herein, we report a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rhodium&#8211;dioxolene complex that exhibits drastic changes in properties with the phase transition. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the room&#8208;temperature (RT) phase is in a mixed&#8208;valence state, and therefore, the drastic changes originate from the mixed&#8208;valence state appearing in the RT phase. Another notable feature is that the mean square displacements of the rhodium atoms along the 1D chain dramatically increase in the RT phase, indicating a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds. From these results, we propose a possible mechanism for the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state in the RT phase based on the thermal electron transfer from the 1D d&#8208;band to the semiquinonato &#960;* orbital coupled with the large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds.</dc:description>

Oranges and lemons: The analogy between the mechanisms of electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitution is discussed and supported by several synthetic examples. These important processes are in an Umpolung relationship.







Abstract
Confrontation of the recently formulated general mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in electron&#8208;deficient arenes with the well&#8208;known mechanism of electrophilic substitution revealed that these fundamental processes are mechanistically identical but proceed according to opposite polarity&#8212;an Umpolung relation.

      <title>The Unexpected Base&#8208;pairing Behavior of Cyanuric Acid in RNA and Ribose versus Cyanuric Acid Induced Helicene Assembly of Nucleic Acids: Implications for the pre&#8208;RNA Paradigm.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanuric acid heterocycle (CA) forms supramolecular structures with adenine nucleobases/nucleosides and oligonucleotides leading to speculation that they can act as forerunners to RNA. Herein, we studied the assembly behavior of RNA containing CA and CA&#8208;ribose nucleoside. Contrary to previous reports, CA in RNA, and as the ribonucleoside, leads to destabilization of supramolecular assemblies, which led to reevaluation of the CA&#8208;adenine hexameric rosette structure. We propose an unprecedented non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helicene structure to account for the striking difference in behavior, which has implications for novel paradigms for reorganizing the structures of nucleic acids, synthesis of long helicenes, and pre&#8208;RNA world paradigms. The results caution against extrapolating the self&#8208;assembly behavior of individual heterocycles from the level of monomers to oligomers &#8211; since the base&#8208;paring properties of (non)canonical nucleobases are impacted by the type of oligomeric backbone to which they are attached.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanochemically triggered topology changes in expanded porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves mechanical force to be an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild ( sub 1nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the most stable H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by means of quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8208;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso &#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves mechanical force to be an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild ( sub 1nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the most stable H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by means of quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8208;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso &#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Partnering a three&#8208;coordinate gallium cation with a hydroborate counter&#8208;ion for the catalytic hydrosilylation of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>A novel &#946;&#8208;diketiminate stabilized gallium hydride, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H (where (DippL) = {HC(MeCDippN)2}, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl and Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl), has been synthesized and shown to undergo insertion of CO2&#160;into the Ga&#8208;H bond under mild conditions. In this case, treatment of the resulting &#954;1&#8208;formate complex with Et3SiH does not lead to regeneration of the hydride precursor. However, when combined with B(C6F5)3, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H catalyses the reductive hydrosilylation of CO2&#160;. Under stoichiometric conditions, the addition of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3&#160;to (DippL)Ga(Ad)H leads to the formation of a 3&#8208;coordinate cationic gallane complex, partnered with a hydroborate anion, [(DippL)Ga(Ad)][HB(C6F5)3]. This complex rapidly hydrometallates carbon dioxide and catalyses the selective reduction of CO2&#160;to the formaldehyde oxidation level in the presence of Et3SiH (yielding H2C(OSiEt3)2). When catalysis is undertaken in the presence of excess B(C6F5)3, appreciable enhancement in the activity of the system is observed, with a corresponding reduction in selectivity. While this system represents proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in CO2&#160;hydrosilylation by a gallium hydride system, the TOF values obtained are relatively modest (max. 10 h&#8208;1). This is attributed to the strength of binding of the formatoborate anion to the Ga centre in the intermediate (DippL)Ga(Ad){HC(O)OB(C6F5)3}, and the correspondingly slow rate of the turnover&#8208;limiting hydrosilylation step. In turn, this strength of binding can be related to the relatively high Lewis acidity measured for the [(DippL)Ga(Ad)]+&#160;cation (AN = 69.8).</dc:description>

      <title>N,S&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbon Nanofiber Films Derived from Fullerenes (C60) as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction and Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Developing highly efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted great attention for creation of electrochemical energy devices. In this study, one&#8208;dimensional (1D) fullerene nanofibers prepared from liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial precipitation were first fabricated into fullerene&#8208;derived carbon nanofiber films (FCNFs) via a simple filtration procedure, and then pyrolysis of FCNFs in the presence of ammonia and sulfur produced N&#8208; and S&#8208; co&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofiber films (N,S&#8208;PCNFs). As excellent metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for ORR, N,S&#8208;PCNFs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity, superior stability and excellent methanol tolerance in both alkaline and acidic solution. Such a high ORR performance benefits from the robust porous nanofiber network structure with high concentrations of active N&#8208; and S&#8208; groups and abundant defects. Notably, when N,S&#8208;PCNFs are practically used as catalysts in a Zn&#8208;air battery, a high power density and a large operating voltage have been achieved, a performance comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work presents a facile strategy for the creation of a new class of energy nanomaterials based on fullerenes, demonstrating their practical uses in electrocatalytic ORR processes and Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Hyaluronic Acid Covered Hierarchically Porous MIL&#8208;nanoMOF for Loading and Controlled Release of Doxorubicin</title>
      <dc:description>The porous nano&#8208;sized metal organic framework (nanoMOF) and its proper surface modification could greatly promote the drug loading capability and introduce biocompatibility, biodegradability, and targeting functions into nano&#8208;drug delivery systems. Herein, the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was successfully fabricated through supramolecular and coordination interactions from three building blocks, including hierarchically porous MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoMOF, phosphite modified adamantane (ADA&#8208;PA), and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified hyaluronic acid (HACD). The obtained HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was nano&#8208;sized and highly stable in physiological fluids. Then, the porous structure of HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle could effectively load commercial chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) with encapsulation rate as 41.20% and loading rate as 48.84%. The obtained drug loaded HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX nanoparticle was pH&#8208;sensitive and relatively stable at neutral condition (pH = 7.2), but could release DOX in controlled way at subacid solution at pH = 5.7. The simulated in vitroDOX release experiment signified that the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX nanoparticle could realize the controlled release of DOX in tumor issues.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The porous nano&#8208;sized metal organic framework (nanoMOF) and its proper surface modification could greatly promote the drug loading capability and introduce biocompatibility, biodegradability, and targeting functions into nano&#8208;drug delivery systems. Herein, the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was successfully fabricated through supramolecular and coordination interactions from three building blocks, including hierarchically porous MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoMOF, phosphite modified adamantane (ADA&#8208;PA), and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified hyaluronic acid (HACD).

      <title>Selective formation of polyaniline confined in the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework for supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, a strategy that can result in the polyaniline (PANI) solely confined within the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without forming obvious bulk PANI between MOF crystals is developed. A water&#8208;stable zirconium&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , is selected as the MOF material. The polymerization of aniline is initiated in the acidic suspension of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  nanocrystals in the presence of excess poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS). Since the pore size of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  is too small to enable the insertion of the bulky PSS, the quick formation of pore&#8208;confined solid PANI and the slower formation of well dispersed PANI:PSS occur within the MOF crystals and in the bulk solution, respectively. By taking advantage of the resulting homogeneous PANI:PSS polymer solution, the bulk PANI:PSS can be removed from the PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  solid by successive washing the sample with fresh acidic solutions through centrifugation. As this is the first time reporting the PANI solely confined in the pores of a MOF, as a demonstration, the obtained PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  composite material is applied as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  thin films exhibit a pseudocapacitive electrochemical characteristic, and their resulting electrochemical activity and charge&#8208;storage capacities are remarkably higher than those of the bulk PANI thin films.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8211;based nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon materials have received increasing attention for constructing next&#8208;generation electrochemical catalysts for energy storage and conversion. However, designing hybrid carbon materials with controllable hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures, excellent dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and multiple heteroatom&#8208;doping remains challenging.

After pyrolysis, MoS  2  &#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons possessing tunable hierarchical micro/mesoporous structures and favorable distributions of MoS  2  nanoparticles exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction as well as small Tafel slope of 66.7 mV dec  &#8722;1  , low onset potential, and excellent cycling stability under acidic condition.

      <title>A Simple Route to the Synthesis of Pt Nanobars and the Mechanistic Understanding of Symmetry Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here we report a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 by simply reducing a Pt  (IV)  precursor in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160 &#176;C in the presence of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of Pt  (IV)  precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant. Our mechanistic study indicated that the anisotropic growth resulted from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here we report a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 by simply reducing a Pt  (IV)  precursor in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160 &#176;C in the presence of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of Pt  (IV)  precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant. Our mechanistic study indicated that the anisotropic growth resulted from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bone Tissue Disorders:&#160;Healing Through Coordination Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Osteoporosis, Paget&#8217;s disease and osteosarcoma are a few examples of bone tissue disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions can strictly limit the lifestyle of patients and may even lead to their demise. To prevent this or, at least, try to manage the situation, there are several treatments available on the market. Notwithstanding, research has been driven by the possibility to improve the existing therapies, as well as to find new approaches that could better respond to these diseases.

In this review it is shown the path through which, in recent years, coordination compounds have been prepared and manufactured to be applied in the management of bone tissue disorders. Starting with the design and preparation of the coordination compounds with various dimensionalities, two approaches have been used: (1) they are prepared as three&#8208;dimensional cages that can act as delivery systems for therapeutic substances, or (2) they are constructed/prepared from compounds with intrinsic therapeutic properties. Following this, several strategies have been explored to manufacture the effective delivery to the patients. The versatility of coordination compounds has allowed their use in the preparation of drug tablets, coatings for titanium implants, or even scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In the end, it becomes clear that these compounds can be a valuable approach to reach a better treatment for bone tissue disorders. Nonetheless, along the road, a few bumps have appeared concerning the therapeutic profile, such as the effect of the structural arrangement or particle size.</dc:description>

The large aperture allows two sets of equivalent networks which are entangled together, resulting in a 2D + 2D &#8594; 3D polycatenated framework. Remarkably, these uranyl compounds exhibits a high catalytic activity for cycloaddition of carbon dioxide. Moreover, the geometric and electronic structures of compounds  1  and  2  are systematically discussed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced electron transfer and ion transport by binary and multidimensional CuCo2S4/Fe2O3 on carbon cloth for water oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>The behavior of electron transfer and ion transport plays a significant role in the electrocatalytic activity. However, the improvement of CuCo  2  S  4  electrocatalytic activity has been a difficult problem lacking of effective electron transfer and ion transport. Herein, the unique structure connects CuCo  2  S  4  nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) with Fe  2  O  3  nanoparticles to form CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC. Compared with CuCo  2  S  4  /CC, the resistances of electron transfer and ion transport are decreased by 65% and 84% respectively. The electrochemical surface area of CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC is 2.76 times larger than that of CuCo  2  S  4  /CC due to the high double layer capacitance. For an oxygen evolution reaction, CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC can achieve an overpotential of 273 mV and a Tafel slope of 67 mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  in alkaline solution.</dc:description>
