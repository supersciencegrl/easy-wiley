         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical routes enable the synthesis of different families of catalytic materials in a more sustainable and convenient way than classical methods. In addition, unusual properties may arise, leading to improved catalytic performance. The review covers the major achievements in the synthesis of catalysts assisted by mechanochemistry, discusses associated aspects, and provides perspectives.







Abstract
The mechanochemical synthesis of nanomaterials for catalytic applications is a growing research field due to its simplicity, scalability, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Besides, it provides materials with distinct features, such as nanocrystallinity, high defect concentration, and close interaction of the components in a system, which are, in most cases, unattainable by conventional routes. Consequently, this research field has recently become highly popular, particularly for the preparation of catalytic materials for various applications, ranging from chemical production over energy conversion catalysis to environmental protection. In this Review, recent studies on mechanochemistry for the synthesis of catalytic materials are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the straightforwardness of the mechanochemical route&#8212;in contrast to more conventional synthesis&#8212;in fabricating the materials, which otherwise often require harsh conditions. Distinct material properties achieved by mechanochemistry are related to their improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy storage: A molecular solar thermal battery is presented, which is based on modified norbornadiene (NBD)/quadricyclane (QC) photoswitches and magnetic nanoparticle catalysts. A library of NBD/QC derivatives is prepared with absorption onsets of up to 450&#8197;nm, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and long storage potentials (t1/2 up to 611&#8197;days). Detailed performance analysis of the novel magnetic NP catalysts is conducted, revealing stability against desorption and high activity with initial TOFs of 3.64&#8197;s&#8722;1 and TON of more than 3305.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts are immobilized on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysts toward an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles through exploitation of the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins, a 22.6&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC&#8208;NBD back&#8208;conversion is achieved, with an initial TOF of up to 3.64&#8197;s&#8722;1 and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, a series of novel &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; functionalized norbornadiene derivatives is prepared, featuring excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366&#8197;nm, quantum yields around 70&#8201;%, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and outstanding thermal stability with t1/2 (25&#8201;&#176;C) over 100&#8197;days. Finally, the energy storage potential of these molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems is harnessed in a heat release experiment. This demonstrates the potential of norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches in combination with efficient magnetic catalysts for the generation of environmentally benign process heat.

         <title>De Novo and Divergent Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Furans by Cascade Reactions of 2&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Great selection! We present herein a de novo and divergent synthesis of 2&#945;&#8208; and 5&#945;&#8208;substituted furans from 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones and a variety of nucleophiles with good regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, as well as a very broad substrate scope (&gt;10 types of nucleophiles for the 5&#945; functionalization and &gt;20 types of nucleophiles for the 2&#945; functionalization; see scheme). The products show good potential as antifungal agents.







Abstract
Herein, a divergent synthesis of a variety of 2&#945;&#8208; and 5&#945;&#8208;substituted furan derivatives from 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is reported. By using appropriate substrates and an acid catalyst, the reactions occurred selectively through cyclization/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition or cyclization/Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cascade reactions. A broad range of nucleophilic reagents (&gt;10 types for the 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition for 5&#945; substitution and &gt;20 types for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cascade reaction for 2&#945; substitution), including alcohols, amides, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, indole, phenols, and many others, can successfully participate in the reactions, providing a universal strategy for a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted furan derivatives. Deuteriation experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to support the proposed reaction mechanisms. Antifungal activity experiments revealed that products with an indole or 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin core substituted at the 2&#945; position showed moderate activities against Rhizoctorzia solani and Botrytis cinerea, respectively.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Metal&#8208;Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liposomes deliver: Glucose was used as template for stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids that can exist in two conformational states. In the active ON state, a Zn2+ ion is complexed by the polar head group of the lipid. The inactive OFF state can be achieved by treating the active lipid with a metal chelator. The active lipids were incorporated into the membrane of liposomes containing a fluorescent cargo. In the presence of a metal chelator, a change in conformation of the incorporated lipids resulted in the release of the cargo from the liposomes, which suggests potential applications in drug delivery.







Abstract
Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial&#8208;based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterials for advanced targeted&#8208;delivery applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liposomes deliver&lt;/b&gt;: Glucose was used as template for stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids that can exist in two conformational states. In the active ON state, a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is complexed by the polar head group of the lipid. The inactive OFF state can be achieved by treating the active lipid with a metal chelator. The active lipids were incorporated into the membrane of liposomes containing a fluorescent cargo. In the presence of a metal chelator, a change in conformation of the incorporated lipids resulted in the release of the cargo from the liposomes, which suggests potential applications in drug delivery.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial&#8208;based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterials for advanced targeted&#8208;delivery applications. Implementation of external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. This paper presents the synthesis of a carbohydrate&#8208;derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;: an active state in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or when exposed to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This is the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a single&#8208;liposome study showed that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage&#8208;free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes.

         <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8208;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pincer ligands: Paramagnetic (M=FeII, CoII) and diamagnetic (M=NiII, CuI, ZnII) mononuclear (M=FeII, CoII, NiII, ZnII) and binuclear (M=CuI) complexes supported by a PGeP pincer chloridogermyl ligand have been prepared from reactions of a dipyrromethane&#8208;derived PGeP germylene with the corresponding metal(II) chlorides.







Abstract
The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2, with late first&#8208;row transition metal (Fe&#8208;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2 and CoCl2 afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M=Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintained an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0&#8197;&#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380&#8197;K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varied linearly with temperature from 1.9&#8197;&#956;B at 10&#8197;K to 3.6&#8197;&#956;B at 380&#8197;K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves S1/2 (predominant at T&lt;180&#8197;K) and S3/2 (predominant at T&gt;200&#8197;K) species. Both cobalt(II) species were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance at T&lt;20&#8197;K. The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme=dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2 involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}2], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl2 led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}].

         <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex&#8211;Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of Their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot&#8208;Spot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural motif defined by a G&#8208;quadruplex DNA juxtaposed to duplex regions has been identified as a hot&#8208;spot for molecular recognition, and selectively targeted by a family of benzylamine&#8208;containing derivatives. The understanding of this new mode of interaction was uncovered by the structural dissection of both ligand and receptor contributions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;G. Santana, C. Gonz&#225;lez, J.&#8197;L. Asensio, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005026).

         <title>Small Molecular Fluorescent Probes for Imaging of Viscosity in Living Biosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. In this minireview, the viscosity&#8208;sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity&#8208;specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.







Abstract
Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. Recently, precise visualization of viscosity has started to arouse more and more interest. However, owing to the complicated character, it is still a huge challenge to directly observe viscosity in living systems. In this regard, mounting fluorescence probes are being increasingly fabricated to map viscosity inside live cells and small animals. In this minireview, the viscosity&#8208;sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity&#8208;specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures, and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
That's so metal: All ten C&#8722;H bonds of ferrocene can be metalated in a simple one&#8208;pot reaction by using mercury butyrate to give permercurated ferrocene, an air&#8208; and water stable compound. The completeness of metalation is confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis.







Abstract
The permercuration of ferrocene was achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10&#8197;equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2 in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10 (X=O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X=O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X=Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes are presented: FeC10(HgX)10 (X=Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That's so metal&lt;/b&gt;: All ten C&#8722;H bonds of ferrocene can be metalated in a simple one&#8208;pot reaction by using mercury butyrate to give permercurated ferrocene, an air&#8208; and water stable compound. The completeness of metalation is confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permercuration of ferrocene was achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10&#8197;equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(HgX)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (X=O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X=O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X=Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes are presented: FeC&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(HgX)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex&#8211;Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of Their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot&#8208;Spot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

&#8220;We found that G&#8208;tetrads adjacent to duplex extensions present unusual electrostatic properties that can be exploited in the design of selective binders. This observation has inspired the design of cationic aromatic frameworks for the selective recognition of quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, thus providing a stepping stone to quadruplex discrimination.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Metal&#8208;Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids based on a glucose head group could promote pore formation in the membrane of liposomes upon treatment with EDTA. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup, it was possible to monitor the release of a fluorescent dye from liposomes containing the metal chelator&#8208;responsive lipids. The liposomes containing the lipids remained stable and able to incapsulate the cargo in the absence of EDTA. Only when introducing the metal chelating EDTA to the liposomes would they release their cargo through pores formed in their membrane. This could serve as a platform for future drug&#8208;delivery systems. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;M. Pedersen et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005332).

         <title>Thermally Responsive Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes Bearing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Pillar[5]arene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyrotaxanes constructed from hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillar[5]arene rings and poly(ethylene oxide) chains were synthesized. A polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene oxide) chain showed temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory properties, because of the topological confinement and cross&#8208;linked hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond networks constructed from pillar[5]arene rings and poly(ethylene oxide) chains are illustrated as music notes and staff notation, respectively.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid&#8208;materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO  3  ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO  3  ) nanoplates as a negative&#8208;electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive&#8208;electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous&#8208;electrolyte (1M H  2  SO  4  ) using three&#8208; and two&#8208; electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO  3  ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with an associated high energy density of 93 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg in a wide 1.6 V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO  3  ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining ~92% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO  3  nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization: A Powerful Toolkit To Arm Natural Products for In Situ Proteome Profiling?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3575-3580, February 19, 2021. </description>

Missing links? Minimalist tagging of natural products for in situ drug profiling is currently accessible from classical organic transformations. Herein, key aryl/heteroaryl C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization methods are summarized and suggestions are made for how some of them could be used for minimalist tagging of natural products and related bioactive compounds.







Abstract
The comprehensive investigation of target interactions from native cellular environments is of paramount importance for natural products and related bioactive compounds in drug discovery and chemical biology. Current chemoproteomic tools, such as in situ proteome profiling can do so effectively, but rely heavily on &#8220;tagged&#8221; probes that are accessible through traditional organic synthesis at the reactive sites of a compound, which may often be required for target binding. Late&#8208;stage functionalization may resolve such limitations by tagging compounds in a single step at biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, recent advances in late&#8208;stage C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of (hetero)arenes, which are present in many natural products, are summarized, and new toolkits for more widespread use of such strategies to install natural products with next&#8208;generation &#8220;minimalist&#8221; linkers for in situ proteome profiling are suggested.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(1&#8208;arylvinyl)aryl)cinnamamides</title>

A highly efficient and straightforward photocatalytic strategy for the preparation of tetrahydrocyclobuta[c]quinolin&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;ones is reported. The reaction presents a high functional group tolerance and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic evidence supports an energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) pathway. The synthetic utility of these molecules was further demonstrated by derivatizations in different positions of the heterocyclic scaffold.







Abstract
N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(1&#8208;arylvinyl)aryl)cinnamamides are converted into natural product inspired scaffolds via iridium photocatalyzed intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition. The protocol has a broad substrate scope, whilst operating under mild reaction conditions. Tethering four components forming a trisubstituted cyclobutane core builds rapidly high molecular complexity. Our approach allows the design and synthesis of a variety of tetrahydrocyclobuta[c]quinolin&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;ones, in yields ranging between 20&#8211;99&#8201;%, and with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,7&#8208;enynes&#8212;after fragmentation of the cyclobutane ring&#8212;leads to enyne&#8208;metathesis&#8208;like products.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Two&#8208;Dimensional NiO/CeO2 Heterostructure Rich in Oxygen Vacancies as Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Evolution</title>

Bifunctional electrocatalysts: A high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional NiO/CeO2 heterostructure (HS) electrocatalyst is fabricated. The unique self&#8208;assembled NiO/CeO2 HSs consisting of NiO and CeO2 nanocrystals is rich in oxygen vacancies and has a large active surface area. These features contribute to the outstanding HER and OER performance in 1&#8201;m KOH. Therefore, these self&#8208;assembled 2&#8201;D NiO/CeO2 HSs are expected to find use in numerous renewable energy systems.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline surroundings is essential and challenging for the large&#8208;scale generation of clean hydrogen. Herein, a novel self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8201;D) NiO/CeO2 heterostructure (HS) consisting of NiO and CeO2 nanocrystals is prepared through a facile two&#8208;step approach, and utilized as an enhanced bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and OER under alkaline conditions. It is concluded that this 2&#8201;D NiO/CeO2 HS, rich in oxygen vacancies, demonstrates attractive electrocatalytic properties for both the HER and OER in 1&#8201;m KOH, including low onset overpotential (&#951;1), &#951;10 and Tafel slope, excellent durability, as well as large active surface area. Therefore, the self&#8208;assembled 2&#8201;D NiO/CeO2 HS is believed to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward the HER and OER.

         <title>&#945;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Regiocontrol and Enantiospecificity in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Substitution Reaction of Propargylic Phosphates with Grignard Reagents</title>

Regioselective cats: Two types of reagents derived from ArMgBr/Cu cat. and ArMgBr/Cu(acac)2 in a ratio of 2:1 were found to be highly &#945;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;regioselective in the substitution reactions of secondary propargylic phosphates with ArMgBr, giving acetylenes and allenes, respectively. The reactions were confirmed to proceed via the SN2&#8242; and anti&#8208;SN2&#8242; pathways. Phosphates bearing Ph at the acetylene end also afforded acetylenes selectively.







Abstract
The regioselectivity (r.s.) and enantiospecificity (e.s.) of the substitution reactions of secondary propargylic alcohol derivatives using reagents derived from ArMgBr and Cu salts were studied. First, the picolinate, 3&#8208;methylpicolinate, and diethylphosphonate derivatives of Ph(CH2)2CH(OH)C&#8801;CTMS were reacted with PhMgBr/CuCN in ratios of 2.5:2.7&#8211;2.5:0.25. The use of 2.5:0.25 ratio in THF/DME (6:1) at 0&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h afforded the &#945;&#8208;substitution product from the phosphate with &#8805;98&#8201;% r.s. and 99&#8201;% e.s. CuBr&#8901;Me2S gave similar selectivity. The reaction system was then applied to phosphates derived from R1CH(OH)C&#8801;CR2 and ArMgBr to obtain synthetically sufficient r.s. and e.s. values with R2=TMS, Ph, whereas iPr was borderline in terms of size as an R1 substituent. The presence of a substituent at the o&#8208;position of Ar marginally affected the selectivity. We also found that the use of PhMgBr/Cu(acac)2 in a 2:1 ratio in THF produced the &#947;&#8208;substitution products (allenes) with high r.s. and e.s.

         <title>Dynamic Ion Speciation during the Hydrolysis of Aryltrifluoroborates**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3812-3816, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s complicated: ESI&#8208;MS analysis of aryltrifluoroborate hydrolysis reveals a complex soup of partially hydrolyzed, dehydrated and aggregate products that eventually settles into a complex equilibrium in which a wide array of species is present. Therefore, when aryltrifluoroborates are used as a &#8220;single&#8208;component&#8221; aryl source in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, an equally complex system might in fact exist.







Abstract
Organotrifluoroborates serve as coupling partners during transmetalation in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction but require hydrolysis prior to the coupling reaction. Their anionic nature allows study of their hydrolysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) through real&#8208;time monitoring, complemented by pH analysis. The induction period varied according to the borates employed, and a dynamic series of equilibria for numerous ions was observed during hydrolysis. We found that the induction periods and reaction rates were sensitive to the R group of the borates, the shape of the reaction vessel, and stir rate.

         <title>Sulfonated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3817-3822, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline sulfonated COFs annulated with cyclic ether moieties were constructed by direct post&#8208;synthetic sulfonation for the first time. Sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK) was further infiltrated into the 1D regular channels of these sulfonated COFs to improve the proton conductivity and reduce the loss of protons (H+). The resulting hybrid material achieves excellent proton conductivity up to 6.22&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Open 1D channels found in covalent organic frameworks are unique and promising to serve as pathways for proton conduction; how to develop high&#8208;rate yet stable transporting systems remains a substantial challenge. Herein, this work reports a strategy for exploring proton&#8208;conducting frameworks by engineering pore walls and installing proton&#8208;containing polymers into the pores. Amide&#8208;linked and sulfonated frameworks were synthesized from imine&#8208;linked precursors via sequentially engineering to oxidize into amide linkages and to further anchor sulfonic acid groups onto the pore walls, enabling the creation of sulfonated frameworks with high crystallinity and channel ordering. Integrating sulfonated polyether ether ketone chains into the open channels enables proton hopping to across the channels, greatly increases proton conductivity and enables a stable continuous run. These results suggest a way to explore proton&#8208;conducting COFs via systematic engineering of the wall and space of the open nanochannels.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of a Frustrated Sn/P Lewis Pair: The Highly Selective Complexation of the cis&#8208;Azobenzene Photoisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3793-3798, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene was found when reacting the isomeric compound with the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (F5C2)3SnCH2P(tBu)2 under UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization conditions.







Abstract
The reactivity of the geminal frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) (F5C2)3SnCH2P(tBu)2 (1) was explored by reacting it with a variety of small molecules (PhOCN, PhNCS, PhCCH, tBuCCH, H3CC(O)CH=CH2, Ph[C(O)]2Ph, PhN=NPh and Me3SiCHN2), featuring polar or non&#8208;polar multiple bonds and/or represent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated systems. While most adducts are formed readily, the binding of azobenzene requires UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization, which results in the highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene. In the case of benzil, the reaction does not lead to the expected 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;addition products, but to the non&#8208;stereoselective (tBu)2PCH2&#8208;transfer to a prochiral keto function of benzil. All adducts of 1 were characterised by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments.

         <title>The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3708-3721, February 19, 2021. </description>

The cascade reactions of indigo with propargyl electrophiles was explored to prepare new, structurally diverse heterocycles. Through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, new synthetic pathways are uncovered with selected products further investigated via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy to unravel photophysical phenomena.







Abstract
The synthesis of structurally diverse heterocycles for chemical space exploration was achieved via the cascade reactions of indigo with propargylic electrophiles. New pyrazinodiindolodione, naphthyridinedione, azepinodiindolone, oxazinoindolone and pyrrolodione products were prepared in one pot reactions by varying the leaving group (&#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;OMs, &#8208;OTs) or propargyl terminal functionality (&#8208;H, &#8208;Me, &#8208;Ph, &#8208;Ar). Mechanistic and density functional theory studies revealed that the unsaturated propargyl moiety can behave as an electrophile when aromatic terminal substitutions are made, and therefore competes with leaving group substitution for new outcomes. Selected products from the cascade reactions were investigated for their absorption and fluorescence properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy. This revealed polarity dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation, thus highlighting these reactions as a means to access diverse functional materials rapidly.

Taking it E/Z: We developed a stereo&#8208; and enantioselective allylation reaction of aldehydes with 1&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)alk&#8208;3&#8208;enes. This offers accesses to both E and Z isomers of a propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motif from the same starting materials by selecting the appropriate transition metal catalyst. The present method was applied to the syntheses of (+)&#8208;isotrichostatic acid, (&#8722;)&#8208;isotrichostatin RK, and (+)&#8208;trichostatic acid.







Abstract
We report a new method for constructing propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motifs in a stereoselective manner. 1&#8208;Substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)&#8208;(E)&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes are generated in&#8197;situ from 1&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)alk&#8208;3&#8208;enes through ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond transposition. These species undergo a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed allylation reaction of aldehydes to produce the E isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols. On the other hand, the corresponding Z isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols are obtained when a dimeric palladium(I) complex is employed as the catalyst for this double&#8208;bond transposition. Thus, both E and Z isomers can be synthesized from the same starting materials. A B&#8722;C(sp2) bond remaining with the allylation product undergoes the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction to furnish a propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motif in a stereo&#8208;defined form. The present method to construct the motifs with (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;alkenes are successfully applied to the syntheses of (+)&#8208;isotrichostatic acid, (&#8722;)&#8208;isotrichostatin RK, and (+)&#8208;trichostatic acid, respectively.

Analogous to Auranofin, CAAC&#8208;supported gold complexes show promising results as antitumoral agents as shown by their cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines. Noticeably, this study includes the probing of their Ic50, their ability to bind and inhibit their biological target (TrxR), non&#8208;specific binding toward non&#8208;tumor associated proteins, their cell&#8208;death mechanism and determination of morphological changes using Transmission Electron Microscopy.







Abstract
Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) have become forceful ligands for gold due to their ability to form very strong ligand&#8208;metal bonds. Inspired by the success of Auranofin and other gold complexes as antitumor agents, we have studied the cytotoxicity of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;CAAC&#8208;gold complexes on different cancer cell lines: HeLa (cervical cancer), A549 (lung cancer), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) and Caov&#8208;3 (ovarian cancer). Further investigations aimed at elucidating their mechanism of action are described. This includes quantification of affinities for TrxR, evaluation of their bioavailability and determination of associated cell death process. Moreover, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to study morphological changes upon exposure. Noticeably, a significant reduction in non&#8208;specific binding to serum proteins was observed with CAAC complexes when compared to Auranofin. These results confirm the potential of CAAC&#8208;gold complexes in biological environments, which may result in more specific drug&#8208;target interactions and decreased side effects.

Bending DNA: The structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA in the presence of AgI ions was obtained using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Novel AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs at N1 positions of adenine, A&#8208;AgI&#8208;A, were obtained in the duplex. A highly bent duplex structure was formed at the center of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs. This is useful for inducing large conformational change in the duplex by adding AgI ions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs have widespread applications, such as in DNA&#8208;metal nanodevices and sensors. Here, we focused on their sugar conformation in duplexes and observed the crystallographic structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA/DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene bridged nucleic acid in the presence of AgI ions. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure was successfully obtained at a resolution of 1.5&#8197;&#197;. A novel type of AgI&#8208;mediated base pair between the N1 positions of anti&#8208;conformation of adenines in the duplex was observed. In the central non&#8208;canonical region, a hexad nucleobase structure containing AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs between the N7 positions of guanines was formed. A highly bent non&#8208;canonical structure was formed at the origin of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs in the central region. The bent duplex structure induced by the addition of AgI ions might become a powerful tool for dynamic structural changes in DNA nanotechnology applications.

         <title>Cephalosporin Prodrug Inhibitors Overcome Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactamase Driven Antibiotic Resistance</title>

Stopping bacterial resistance: Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases (MBLs) are bacterial resistance enzymes that degrade &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics, including last line of defense carbapenems like meropenem. A new series of cephalosporin prodrug inhibitors that exploit the hydrolytic action of the target MBL itself to activate the inhibitor is reported. The prodrugs display potent MBL inhibition and effectively synergize with meropenem against highly resistant MBL&#8208;expressing isolates.







Abstract
The increasing prevalence of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL)&#8208;expressing bacteria presents a worrying trend in antibiotic resistance. MBLs rely on active site zinc ions for their hydrolytic activity and the pursuit of MBL&#8208;inhibitors has therefore involved the investigation of zinc chelators. To ensure that such chelators specifically target MBLs, a series of cephalosporin prodrugs of two potent zinc&#8208;binders: dipicolinic acid (DPA) and 8&#8208;thioquinoline (8&#8208;TQ) was prepared. Although both DPA and 8&#8208;TQ bind free zinc very tightly (Kd values in the low nm range), the corresponding cephalosporin conjugates do not. The cephalosporin conjugates are efficiently hydrolyzed by MBLs to release DPA or 8&#8208;TQ, as confirmed by using both NMR and LC&#8208;MS studies. Notably, the cephalosporin prodrugs of DPA and 8&#8208;TQ show potent inhibitory activity against NDM, VIM, and IMP classes of MBLs and display potent synergy with meropenem against MBL&#8208;expressing clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Study on the Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalization of Olefins Using Glycine&#8208;Extended AQ&#8208;Auxiliaries</title>

Understanding the hydrofunctionalization: A tridentate ligand bearing a quinoline, aryl amide and alkyl amine moieties is highly&#8208;reactive for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of tethered unactivated olefins, allowing reactions at temperatures as low as 25&#8201;&#176;C, while its regioisomer with the amide carbonyl transposed only one position away shows limited reactivity. This experimental and computational study explores the scope of this reaction and demonstrates how the Pd&#8208;substrate complexes employ various favorable or unfavorable protonation states during the mechanism.







Abstract
Two similar tridentate directing groups derived from glycine and 8&#8208;aminoquinoline were shown to enable the palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of 4&#8208;pentenylamine with drastically different efficiencies. A computational investigation into the origin of the reactivity difference between these isomeric, carbonyl&#8208;transposed auxiliaries suggests that protonation state, thus charge of the substrate&#8208;metal complex prior to nucleopalladation is key. These investigations have culminated in a directing group design that can undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization under relatively mild conditions, as low as room temperature.

         <title>A Series of Bisamide&#8208;Substituted Diacetylenes Exhibiting a Terminal Alkyl Odd/Even Parity Effect on Mechanoactivated Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3832-3841, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odd versus even: A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes with varying terminal alkyl spacer length showed unique pressure&#8208;induced photopolymerizability. The odd or even parity of the terminal alkyl gave a light&#8208;active and light&#8208;inert pristine state, respectively. It is revealed that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds were highly influenced by the terminal alkyl parity, resulting in the different crystalline packings and photopolymerization properties.







Abstract
Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization relies on the monomer diynes arrangement. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the first mechanoresponsive bisamide substituted diacetylenes (DAs) show dramatic switching from light&#8208;inert to light&#8208;reactive states at a given pressure. The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain more insight, herein a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length is presented, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion is examined. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&#955;=254&#8197;nm) unless external pressure was applied. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd/even parity plays a key role in determining the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding nature of DA crystals and the resultant molecular packing.

     alt="A Series of Bisamide&#8208;Substituted Diacetylenes Exhibiting a Terminal Alkyl Odd/Even Parity Effect on Mechanoactivated Photopolymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Odd versus even&lt;/b&gt;: A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes with varying terminal alkyl spacer length showed unique pressure&#8208;induced photopolymerizability. The odd or even parity of the terminal alkyl gave a light&#8208;active and light&#8208;inert pristine state, respectively. It is revealed that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds were highly influenced by the terminal alkyl parity, resulting in the different crystalline packings and photopolymerization properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization relies on the monomer diynes arrangement. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the first mechanoresponsive bisamide substituted diacetylenes (DAs) show dramatic switching from light&#8208;inert to light&#8208;reactive states at a given pressure. The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain more insight, herein a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length is presented, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion is examined. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=254&#8197;nm) unless external pressure was applied. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd/even parity plays a key role in determining the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding nature of DA crystals and the resultant molecular packing. In addition, the relevant thermochromic behavior was also observed from photopolymerized polydiacetylenes.&lt;/p&gt;

Hetero&#8208;bimetallic ruthenium(II)&#8208;ferrocenyl complexes with nanomolar potency towards cancer cell lines, which retain their activity in hypoxic conditions, show dose&#8208;dependent DNA damage and are active inhibitors of bacterial and fungal strains.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of new bis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate complexes, [(bpy)2Ru(Fc&#8208;acac)][PF6] (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; Fc&#8208;acac=functionalized ferrocenyl &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligand) are reported. Alongside clinical platinum drugs, these bimetallic ruthenium&#8208;iron complexes have been screened for their cytotoxicity against MIA PaCa&#8208;2 (human pancreatic carcinoma), HCT116 p53+/+ (human colon carcinoma, p53&#8208;wild type) and ARPE&#8208;19 (human retinal pigment epithelial) cell lines. With the exception of one complex, the library exhibit nanomolar potency against cancerous cell lines, and their relative potencies are up to 40x, 400x and 72x more cytotoxic than cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, the complexes remain cytotoxic (sub&#8208;micromolar range), highlighting their potential in targeting hypoxic tumor regions. The Comet assay was used to determine their ability to damage DNA, and results show dose dependent damage which correlates well with the cytotoxicity results. Their potential to treat bacterial and fungal strains has been determined, and highlight complexes have selective growth inhibition of up to 87&#8211;100&#8201;% against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.

         <title>From Carbohydrates to Complex Organofluorines: Synthesis, Conformation, and Lipophilicity of Multivicinal&#8208;Fluorine&#8208;Containing Hexitol Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3799-3805, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet organofluorines: Multi&#8208;vicinally fluorinated hexitol analogues have been synthesized. The solution and solid&#8208;state conformations of trifluorohexitol analogues were uncovered, and the stereochemistry of the fluorine atoms was found to show a preferential gauche effect, avoiding repulsive 1,3&#8208;interactions. Finally, the log&#8201;P values of a large set of polyfluorohexitols were obtained by using 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
There is growing interest in the preparation of fluorine&#8208;containing organic molecules. Multivicinal&#8208;fluorine analogues are among the most intriguing and promising compounds, but their physical and biological investigations are held back by challenging syntheses. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a large set of novel polyfluorohexitols. The dominant solution&#8208;state conformation of all trifluorohexitols was determined, and the solid&#8208;state conformations of some analogues were compared. Finally, the lipophilicity of a large set of polyfluorinated hexopyranose and hexitol analogues was attributed by using a log&#8201;P determination method based on 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;Cl Borylation of Fluorinated Aryl Chlorides</title>

The best base is no base! We report an efficient method for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;Cl borylation of aryl chlorides containing two ortho&#8208;fluorines. The reactions are conducted under base&#8208;free conditions to avoid decomposition of the products which are sensitive to base.







Abstract
Catalytic C&#8722;X borylation of aryl halides containing two ortho&#8208;fluorines has been found to be challenging, as most previous methods require stoichiometric amounts of base and the polyfluorinated aryl boronates suffer from protodeboronation, which is accelerated by ortho&#8208;fluorine substituents. Herein, we report that a combination of Pd(dba)2 (dba=dibenzylideneacetone) with SPhos (2&#8208;dicyclohexylphosphino&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl) as a ligand is efficient to catalyze the C&#8208;Cl borylation of aryl chlorides containing two ortho&#8208;fluorine substituents. This method, conducted under base&#8208;free conditions, is compatible with the resulting di&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluorinated aryl boronate products which are sensitive to base.

Cd&#8208;based MOF SXU&#8208;4 can selectively and sensitively detect trace amount of DMSO in various solvents through a turn&#8208;on based luminescence mechanism. It can be used as luminescent probe for rapid DMSO residual detection.







Abstract
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a universally used solvent in various synthetic reactions, and trace amounts of DMSO residual are often seen on the surface of chemical product. It is difficult to quickly determine whether the residual DMSO is washed completely. This work reports a CdII metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) SXU&#8208;4 which can detect trace amounts of DMSO in various solvents. Fluorescence experiments reveal its turn&#8208;on fluorescence effect toward DMSO with high selectivity and sensitivity, indicating that it can be used as an effective luminescent probe for rapid chemical product purity detection by testing the washing solution. Crystallographically characterized DMSO loaded SXU&#8208;4 (DMSO@SXU&#8208;4), in combination with computational results uncover that the enhanced DMSO&#8211;MOF conjugation through multiple DMSO&#8211;MOF supramolecule interactions and charge rearrangement are the main causes of fluorescence intensification.

         <title>Understanding the C&#8722;F Bond Activation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Crucial Role of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions</title>

C&#8722;F activation: The activation of single C&#8722;F bonds in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups mediated by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) exhibits a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where non&#8208;covalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role.







Abstract
The activation of a single C&#8722;F bond in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has been computationally explored by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. It is found that in this activation reaction the FLP partners exhibit a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where non&#8208;covalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role. In addition, the process proceeds through the intermediacy of a hypervalent species featuring a pentacoordinate carbon atom, which is rare in the chemistry of FLPs. The physical factors controlling this process as well as the bonding situation of these hypervalent intermediates have been quantitatively analyzed in detail by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods to not only rationalize the mechanism of the transformation but also to guide experimentalists towards the realization of these so far elusive hypervalent systems.

         <title>In CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film, the Surface Termination Layer Dominates the Moisture Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3729-3736, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different surface terminations on perovskite film determine the existence state of water molecules, which further restrain the humidity degradation process of MAPbI3 films. Under 85&#8201;% RH humidity treatment, MAI&#8208;terminated perovskite film degrades from MAPbI3 to MAPbI3&#8901;H2O and then to PbI2 layer by layer, whereas, for the PbI&#8208;terminated film, MAPbI3 decomposes directly into PbI2 by deprotonation degradation.







Abstract
Theoretical studies have shown that surface terminations, such as MAI or PbI layers, greatly affect the environmental stability of organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite. However, until now, there has been little effort to experimentally detect the existence of MAI or PbI terminations on MAPbI3 grains, let alone disclose their effects on the humidity degradation pathway of perovskite solar cell. Here, we successfully modified and detected the surface terminations of MAI and PbI species on polycrystalline MAPbI3 films. MAI&#8208;terminated perovskite film followed the moisture degradation process from MAPbI3 to hydrate MAPbI3&#8901;H2O and then into PbI2, with penetration of water molecules being the main driving force leading to the degradation of MAPbI3 layer by layer. In contrast, for the PbI&#8208;terminated perovskite film in a humid atmosphere, a deprotonation degradation pathway was confirmed, in which the film preferentially degraded directly from MAPbI3 into PbI2, here the iodine defects played a key role in promoting the dissociation of water molecules into OH&#8722; and further catalyzing the decomposition of perovskite.

         <title>Surface Engineering Strategy Using Urea To Improve the Rate Performance of Na2Ti3O7 in Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3875-3886, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe, controllable and affordable method using urea at mild temperatures to synthesise a series of sodium titanate samples with different levels of oxygen vacancies is reported. The formation of oxygen vacancies leads to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ ions in NTO, together with the formation of hydroxyl groups and a secondary phase, Na2Ti6O13.The urea&#8208;treated samples showed superior electrochemical performance at high rates with respect to pristine NTO.







Abstract
Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) is considered a promising anode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries due to its layered structure with an open framework and low and safe average operating voltage of 0.3&#8197;V vs. Na+/Na. However, its poor electronic conductivity needs to be addressed to make this material attractive for practical applications among other anode choices. Here, we report a safe, controllable and affordable method using urea that significantly improves the rate performance of NTO by producing surface defects such as oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups, and the secondary phase Na2Ti6O13. The enhanced electrochemical performance agrees with the higher Na+ ion diffusion coefficient, higher charge carrier density and reduced bandgap observed in these samples, without the need of nanosizing and/or complex synthetic strategies. A comprehensive study using a combination of diffraction, microscopic, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques supported by computational studies based on DFT calculations, was carried out to understand the effects of this treatment on the surface, chemistry and electronic and charge storage properties of NTO. This study underscores the benefits of using urea as a strategy for enhancing the charge storage properties of NTO and thus, unfolding the potential of this material in practical energy storage applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Planar Structures of Sterically Overcrowded Trialkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3700-3707, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even record&#8208;breaking steric stress cannot enforce complete planarization of the nitrogen atom in trialkylamines as shown, for example, for di&#8208;1&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;exo&#8208;2&#8208;norbornylamine with the help of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations in the solid phase as well as in the gas phase.







Abstract
Several amines with three bulky alkyl groups at the nitrogen atom, which exceed the steric crowding of triisopropylamine significantly, were synthesized, mainly by treating N&#8208;chlorodialkylamines with Grignard reagents. In six cases, namely tert&#8208;butyldiisopropylamine, 1&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;tert&#8208;butylisopropylamine, di&#8208;1&#8208;adamantylamines with an additional N&#8208;cyclohexyl or N&#8208;exo&#8208;2&#8208;norbonyl substituent, as well as 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine derivatives with N&#8208;cyclohexyl or N&#8208;neopentyl groups, appropriate single crystals were generated that enabled X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and analysis of the molecular structures. The four noncyclic amines adopt triskele&#8208;like conformations, and the sum of the three C&#8722;N&#8722;C angles is always in the range of 351.1&#176; to 352.4&#176;. Consequently, these amines proved to be structurally significantly flatter than trialkylamines without steric congestion, which is also signalized by the smaller heights of the NC3 pyramids (0.241&#8211;0.259&#8197;&#197;). There is no clear correlation between the heights of these pyramids and the degree of the steric crowding in the new amines, presumably because steric repulsion is partly compensated by dispersion interaction. In the cases of the two heterocyclic amines, the steric stress is smaller, and the molecular structures include quite different conformations. Quantum chemical calculations led to precise gas&#8208;phase structures of the sterically overcrowded trialkylamines exhibiting heights of the NC3 pyramids and preferred molecular conformers which are similar to those resulting from the X&#8208;ray studies.

Microsphere anode materials: Self&#8208;assembled FeSe2 microspheres are synthesized through a facile solvothermal method. The FeSe2 microspheres exhibit superior rate performance and long cycle stability in both sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;ion batteries have attracted intensive attention recently as low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries with naturally abundant resources. However, the large ionic radii of Na+ and K+ render their slow mobility, leading to sluggish diffusion in host materials. Herein, hierarchical FeSe2 microspheres assembled by closely packed nano/microrods are rationally designed and synthesized through a facile solvothermal method. Without carbonaceous material incorporation, the electrode delivers a reversible Na+ storage capacity of 559&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current rate of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable rate performance with a capacity of 525&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. As for K+ storage, the FeSe2 anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 393&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current rate of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a discharge capacity of 322&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be achieved, which is among the best high&#8208;rate anodes for K+ storage. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the favorable morphological structure and the use of an ether&#8208;based electrolyte during cycling. Moreover, quantitative study suggests a strong pseudocapacitive contribution, which boosts fast kinetics and interfacial storage.

         <title>Morpholine&#8208;Substituted Rhodamine Analogue with Multi&#8208;Configurational Switches for Optical Sensing of pH Gradient under Extreme Acidic Environments</title>

         <dc:description>
A new type of rhodamine&#8208;based pH&#8208;responsive molecule displaying stable two&#8208;step structural and color conversion in response to pH has been developed. This rhodamine analogue could be applied to optical sensing of pH gradient under extreme acidic environments both in solution and on hydrogel. Furthermore, this multi&#8208;responsive character enabled optical memory of different pH information.







Abstract
Superior pH&#8208;responsive molecules are required for the development of functional materials applicable to advanced molecular technologies. Despite having been widely developed, many rhodamine&#8208;based pH&#8208;responsive molecules exhibit a single configurational switch for &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;. Herein, we report a new type of rhodamine&#8208;based pH&#8208;responsive molecule with multi&#8208;configurational switches displaying stable two&#8208;step structural and color conversion in response to pH. This rhodamine analogue could be successfully applied to optical sensing of pH gradient under extreme acidic environments both in solution and on hydrogel through high&#8208;contrast color change. We demonstrated that this multi&#8208;responsive character enabled optical memory of different pH information.

Ambiphilic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, indol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IdY), is reported. The ambiphilicity is characterized by IdY&#8208;supported materials. The nonclassical hydrogen bonding (NCHB) of IdY&#8211;Se complex is characterized by X&#8208;ray and computational studies. Furthermore, the carboboration of terminal alkynes using IdY&#8211;Cu complexes can be performed within 30 minutes with good yields and high regioselectivity.







Abstract
The synthesis of ambiphilic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, indol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IdY, A), is described. A series of indolenium precursors (2&#8201;a&#8211;f) were prepared on a gram scale in good yields. Trapping experiments with elemental selenium, [RhCl(cod)]2 and CuCl provided the expected carbene adducts. Further computational and spectroscopic studies supported the ambiphilicity of IdY, which lies between cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAAC&#8208;5) and cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC). The copper complexes (6) show high percent buried volume (%&#8201;Vbur = 58.1) and allow for carboboration of terminal alkynes within 30 minutes in a demonstration of synthetic utility with good yields and high regioselectivity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Syngas Production over Defective ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3786-3792, February 19, 2021. </description>

Efficient syngas production from CO2 photoreduction is achieved by S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets. The critical role of S vacancies in tuning catalysis activity and selectivity is emphasized.







Abstract
Photocatalytic syngas (CO and H2) production with CO2 as gas source not only ameliorates greenhouse effect, but also produces valuable chemical feedstocks. However, traditional photocatalytic systems require noble metal or suffers from low yield. Here, we demonstrate that S vacancies ZnIn2S4 (VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4) nanosheets are an ideal photocatalyst to drive CO2 reduction into syngas. It is found that building S vacancies can endow ZnIn2S4 with stronger photoabsorption, efficient electron&#8211;hole separation, and larger CO2 adsorption, finally promoting both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The syngas yield of CO and H2 is therefore significantly increased. In contrast to pristine ZnIn2S4, the syngas yield over VS&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can be improved by roughly &#8776;4.73&#8197;times and the CO/H2 ratio is modified from 1:4.18 to 1:1. Total amount of syngas after 12&#8197;h photocatalysis is as high as 63.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 without use of any noble metals, which is even higher than those of traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts in the reported literatures. This work demonstrates the critical role of S vacancies in mediating catalytic activity and selectivity, and highlights the attractive ability of defective ZnIn2S4 for light&#8208;driven syngas production.

         <title>Cover Feature: Non&#8208;Planar Structures of Sterically Overcrowded Trialkylamines (Chem. Eur. J. 11/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3571-3571, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even record&#8208;breaking steric stress cannot enforce complete planarization of the nitrogen atom in trialkylamines. This is demonstrated for several examples with the aid of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Moreover, quantum chemical calculations generate the precise gas&#8208;phase structures of the sterically overcrowded tertiary amines showing heights of the NC3 pyramids and preferred molecular conformers, which are similar to those resulting from the X&#8208;ray analysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Banert, M. W&#246;rle, A.&#8197;D. Boese, et&#8197;al. on page 3700.

         <title>Frontispiece: Spotlight on Photoinduced Aryl Migration Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rearrangement reactions are a very powerful tool for the conversion of simple substrates into highly functionalized products in organic chemistry. In combination with an attractive initiation process, such as visible&#8208;light catalysis, these reactions are particularly powerful. Read more about recent progress on visible&#8208;light aryl migration reactions, focusing especially on Smiles rearrangement and related reactions in the Review by E. Brachet et&#8197;al. on page 3581.

         <title>Frontispiece: How to Build Prussian Blue Based Water Oxidation Catalytic Assemblies: Common Trends and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of cyanoferrate ions (yellow solution) with cobalt ions (pink solution) affords CoFe Prussian blue assemblies with cubic structures. As soon as the liquids are mixed (and this can be done even in a simple glassware), the solution turns orange&#8208;brown, and precipitation occurs. Such assemblies have been acknowledged as efficient, robust, and precious&#8208;metal free heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts. The Minireview by F. Karadas and co&#8208;workers on page 3638 highlights the common strategies to design and prepare cyanide&#8208;based electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical assemblies and explores the role of structural units in cobalt&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues for the establishment of structure&#8211;catalytic&#8208;activity relationship.

Thermal ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutaphenanthrenes into thermodynamically stable o&#8208;quinodimethanes is reported in this work. In the cover artwork, the balance of the Lady Justice indicates that energy difference between the energy loss due to dearomatization of the benzene ring in cyclobutaphenanthrene and the strain energy of the four&#8208;membered ring is decisive for ring&#8208;opening. The o&#8208;quinodimethanes obtained through this strategy can be used as a reactive platform to access novel polycyclic aromatic compounds. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Hamura et&#8197;al. on page 3665.

A crystalline and ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) film was successfully synthesized at the air/water interface through [2+2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition. The self&#8208;assembly process induced from the strong donor&#8211;acceptor interactions realizes the pre&#8208;organization of the monomers which is the key role to keep the highly ordered structure in the subsequent photo&#8208;polymerization. Various microscopy techniques demonstrated the successful formation of the ultrathin, large&#8208;area, and free&#8208;standing 2DP film. TERS technology was applied to verify the successful polymerization. More importantly, the molecular structure of the 2DP was explicitly analyzed by a combination of SAED pattern and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation. More information can be found in the Communication by L. Sun, Y. Zhao, et&#8197;al. on page 3661.

         <title>Cover Feature: The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity (Chem. Eur. J. 11/2021)</title>

One&#8208;pot domino reactions of indigo with propargyl derivatives produce structurally diverse heterocycles including new pyrazinodiindolodiones, azepinodiindolones, and oxazinoindolones. Mechanistic and DFT studies show propargyl moieties behaving as electrophiles when terminally substituted, thereby competing with leaving groups. Photophysical properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy reveal polarity&#8208;dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;A. Keller et&#8197;al. on page 3708.

         <title>As Nice as &#960;: Aromatic Reactions Activated by &#960;&#8208;Coordination to Transition Metals</title>

Easy as &#960;: &#960;&#8208;Coordination of aromatic compounds to transition metals dramatically alters the reactivity of the arene. In this Minireview, the authors highlight reactions that exploit this increased activity, selecting examples that are both stoichiometric and catalytic in the activating metal. The advantages and limitations of the activation strategy are discussed and it is considered which areas of future research will benefit from this technique.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Coordination of aromatic molecules to metals dramatically alters their reactivity. For example, coordinated carbons become more electrophilic and C&#8722;H bonds of coordinated rings become more acidic. For many years, this change in reactivity has been used to trigger reactions that would not take place for uncoordinated arenes, however, there has been a recent resurgence in use of this technique, in part due to the development of catalytic reactions in which &#960;&#8208;coordination is transient. In this Minireview, we describe the key reaction chemistry of arenes coordinated to a range of transition metals, including stereoselective reactions and industrially relevant syntheses. We also summarise outstanding examples of catalytic processes. Finally, we give perspectives on the future direction of the field, with respect to both reactions that are stoichiometric in activating metals and those employing catalytic metal.

         <title>How to Build Prussian Blue Based Water Oxidation Catalytic Assemblies: Common Trends and Strategies</title>

Blue is the color: Cobalt&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (CoFe PBAs) have been established as one of the well&#8208;known non&#8208;oxide bulk water oxidation catalysts, which can operate even under harsh acidic conditions. This review presents the common synthetic strategies to enhance their catalytic activities and general trends in Prussian blue based photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical assemblies.







Abstract
Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have at least a three&#8208;century&#8208;long history in coordination chemistry. Recently, cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts. Given the flexibility in their synthesis, the structure and morphology of cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been modified for enhanced catalytic activity under electrochemical (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Here, in this review, the work on cobalt&#8208;based PBAs is presented in four sections: i)&#8197;electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii)&#8197;photocatalytic processes in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii)&#8197;photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv)&#8197;the utilization of PBA&#8208;PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers through the structure and catalytic activity relationship in cobalt&#8208;based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component. Furthermore, this review aims to provide insight into common strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of PBAs.

         <title>Spotlight on Photoinduced Aryl Migration Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3581-3607, February 19, 2021. </description>

All smiles: This review summarizes recent reports on photoinduced aryl migration reactions to allow the access to a broad range of functionalized structures. These transformations occur by remote rearrangements and functional&#8208;group modifications. The use of such a strategy opens the way to a plethora of structures under mild and efficient conditions.







Abstract
Rearrangement reactions are certainly one of the most useful approaches towards complex structures in organic chemistry. With efficient conditions, it is indeed possible to convert simple substrates into highly functionalized products. Moreover, combining this approach with an attractive initiation process, such as visible&#8208;light catalysis, makes these reactions particularly powerful. Recently, tremendous improvements have been made, owing to a better understanding of photoredox mechanisms. In this review, recent progress on visible&#8208;light aryl migration reactions is discussed, focusing especially on Smiles rearrangement and related reactions.

         <title>Lanthanoid Complexes as Molecular Materials: The Redox Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3608-3637, February 19, 2021. </description>

The redox&#8208;activity of lanthanoid complexes can arise from metal, ligand or rarely, both components. Harnessing the synergy between metal and ligand redox&#8208;activity will ultimately facilitate the development of new molecular materials with novel and enhanced functionality.







Abstract
The development of molecular materials with novel functionality offers promise for technological innovation. Switchable molecules that incorporate redox&#8208;active components are enticing candidate compounds due to their potential for electronic manipulation. Lanthanoid metals are most prevalent in their trivalent state and usually redox&#8208;activity in lanthanoid complexes is restricted to the ligand. The unique electronic and physical properties of lanthanoid ions have been exploited for various applications, including in magnetic and luminescent materials as well as in catalysis. Lanthanoid complexes are also promising for applications reliant on switchability, where the physical properties can be modulated by varying the oxidation state of a coordinated ligand. Lanthanoid&#8208;based redox activity is also possible, encompassing both divalent and tetravalent metal oxidation states. Thus, utilization of redox&#8208;active lanthanoid metals offers an attractive opportunity to further expand the capabilities of molecular materials. This review surveys both ligand and lanthanoid centered redox&#8208;activity in pre&#8208;existing molecular systems, including tuning of lanthanoid magnetic and photophysical properties by modulating the redox states of coordinated ligands. Ultimately the combination of redox&#8208;activity at both ligands and metal centers in the same molecule can afford novel electronic structures and physical properties, including multiconfigurational electronic states and valence tautomerism. Further targeted exploration of these features is clearly warranted, both to enhance understanding of the underlying fundamental chemistry, and for the generation of a potentially important new class of molecular material.

         <title>Coordination Behavior of a P4&#8208;Butterfly Complex towards Transition Metal Lewis Acids: Preservation versus Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3675-3681, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly flexible: By coordination to Lewis acids the P4 butterfly complex can preserve the initial P4 butterfly scaffold and act as a 4&#963; e&#8722; donor. However, in the presence of weakly ligated d6 metals, the P4 unit tends to rearrange. This leads to a rare octaphospha&#8208;cobalt&#8208;sandwich complex in which the P4 units have isomerized into aromatic cyclo&#8208;P4[Fe]2 units ([Fe]=Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2). Additionally, also a dimerization to an all&#8208;phosphorus derivative of bicylo[3.3.0]octane is observed.







Abstract
The reactivity of the P4 butterfly complex [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;P4)] (1, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) towards divalent Co, Ni and Zn salts is investigated. The reaction with the bromide salts leads to [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#956;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4){MBr2}] (M=Co (2Co), Ni (2Ni), Zn (2Zn)) in which the P4 butterfly scaffold is preserved. The use of the weakly ligated Co complex [Co(NCCH3)6][SbF6]2, results in the formation of [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#956;3,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Co][SbF6]3 (3), which represents the second example of a homoleptic&#8208;like octaphospha&#8208;metalla&#8208;sandwich complex. The formation of the threefold positively charged complex&#8197;3 occurs via redox processes, which among others also enables the formation of [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}4(&#956;5,&#951;4:1:1:1:1&#8208;P8){Co(CO)2}][SbF6] (4), bearing a rare octaphosphabicyclo[3.3.0]octane unit as a ligand. On the other hand, the reaction with [Zn(NCCH3)4][PF6]2 yields the spiro complex [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#956;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Zn][PF6]2 (5) under preservation of the initial structural motif.

This leads to a rare octaphospha&#8208;cobalt&#8208;sandwich complex in which the P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units have isomerized into aromatic &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units ([Fe]=Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Additionally, also a dimerization to an all&#8208;phosphorus derivative of bicylo[3.3.0]octane is observed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of the P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; butterfly complex [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) towards divalent Co, Ni and Zn salts is investigated. The reaction with the bromide salts leads to [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;){MBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] (M=Co (&lt;b&gt;2Co&lt;/b&gt;), Ni (&lt;b&gt;2Ni&lt;/b&gt;), Zn (&lt;b&gt;2Zn&lt;/b&gt;)) in which the P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; butterfly scaffold is preserved. The use of the weakly ligated Co complex [Co(NCCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, results in the formation of [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;4:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), which represents the second example of a homoleptic&#8208;like octaphospha&#8208;metalla&#8208;sandwich complex. The formation of the threefold positively charged complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; occurs via redox processes, which among others also enables the formation of [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;4:1:1:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;){Co(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), bearing a rare octaphosphabicyclo[3.3.0]octane unit as a ligand. On the other hand, the reaction with [Zn(NCCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields the spiro complex [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) under preservation of the initial structural motif.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions Induced Interfacial Synthesis of an Ultrathin Fluoric 2D Polymer by Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3661-3664, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin 2DP film based on a photo&#8208;triggered [2+2] cycloaddition was prepared at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8211;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing the highly ordered structure.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a preparation of ultrathin 2DP film based on photo&#8208;triggered [2+2] cycloaddition at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8211;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing the highly ordered structure. The precise structure and chemical compositions of the continuous 2DP films were proved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Higher Nuclearity Polyazanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3670-3674, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain gang: Polyazanes of up to five &#963;&#8208;bonded nitrogen atoms were prepared by sequential addition to diazo reagents. Structural analyses showed that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation maintained by the carboxyl substituents. The conformations persist in solution. Polyazanes are increasingly less reducing the more N atoms are in the chain.







Abstract
Polyazanes (i.e., higher nuclearity homologues of hydrazines) with increasing numbers of bound nitrogen atoms (from 3 to 5), including the first pentazane ever described, were prepared by the addition of lower&#8208;order polyazanes to diazo reagents. A structure was obtained. It was shown that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation. DFT modeling shows that the arrangement persists in solution. Although the polyazanes are all reducing agents, they become less so as the number of nitrogens increases.

         <title>Photoinduced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dicarbofunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3694-3699, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes at room temperature is achieved using simple, bench&#8208;stable alkyl iodides and a second molecule of alkyne as coupling partner. This alkylation&#8211;alkynylation sequence allows the one&#8208;step synthesis of 1,3&#8208;enynes including heteroarenes and biologically active compounds with high efficiency without exogenous photosensitizers or oxidants.







Abstract
Herein, a conceptually distinct approach was developed that allowed for the dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes at room temperature using simple, bench&#8208;stable alkyl iodides and a second molecule of alkyne as coupling partner. Specifically, the photochemical activation of palladium complexes enabled this strategic dicarbofunctionalization via addition of alkyl radicals from secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides and formation of an intermediate palladium vinyl complex that could undergo subsequent Sonogashira reaction with a second alkyne molecule. This alkylation&#8211;alkynylation sequence allowed the one&#8208;step synthesis of 1,3&#8208;enynes including heteroarenes and biologically active compounds with high efficiency without exogenous photosensitizers or oxidants and now opens up pathways towards cascade reactions via photochemical palladium catalysis.

P beats N: A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is reported. Importantly, the reaction has a broad functional group tolerance and is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, while operating at room temperature. The design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products.







Abstract
A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is herein reported. Importantly, the reaction is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, and operates at room temperature. Moreover, the design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products, a rarely documented effect. This electro&#8208;oxidative coupling process also displays exceptional tolerance of many fragile easily oxidized functional groups such as hydroxy, aldehyde, olefin, alkyne, as well as neighboring benzylic positions. The enantiomeric enrichment of some chiral alcohols is moreover preserved during this electro&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction, making it overall a promising synthetic tool.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>

In this study, the emission of xanthene dye is pushed to the NIR region by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. The newly developed KRhs display intense fluorescence peaks at 700&#8197;nm (&#934;F 0.64) and, more importantly, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support super&#8208;resolution imaging. These KRh derivatives display great potential for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.







Abstract
Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display an intense NIR emission peak at 700&#8197;nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability, respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.

Isolable o&#8208;quiondimethanes are prepared by thermal ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutaphenanthrenes. In addition to benzo&#8208;annulation on parent benzocyclobutene, sterically congested aryloxy or siloxy groups on the four&#8208;membered ring promote the ring&#8208;opening, affording a thermodynamically stable &#960;&#8208;extended o&#8208;quinodimethane.







Abstract
Thermal isomerization of cyclobutaphenanthrene to o&#8208;quinodimethane was investigated. Sterically congested substituents or electron&#8208;donating substituents on the four&#8208;membered ring promoted the ring&#8208;opening, affording o&#8208;quinodimethane in a relatively stable form. Isolation of the newly prepared o&#8208;quinodimethane allowed its structural elucidation and investigation of its potential reactivities. Dual [4+2] cycloaddition of an aryne and o&#8208;quinodimethane afforded tetrabenzopentacene, demonstrating the synthetic application of the isolated compound.

         <title>An Electron&#8208;Accepting aza&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
Shine, little molecule, shine: A molecule that is bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent owing to a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state was developed based on a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure comprising a pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY analog (PPAB) as an acceptor. Its high external quantum efficiency of 3.7&#8201;% in electroluminescence studies and low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of circa 80&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 indicate the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
A bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) approach using an aza&#8208;BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron&#8208;accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) to develop a D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with an enhanced fluorescence brightness of up to 5.2&#215;104&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and the PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behavior in emission. Transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7&#8201;% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Photoswitchable Fluorescent Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles with High Photostability</title>

Get the glow: Photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance are constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) as a coordination acceptor via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer.







Abstract
In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance have been constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (BTE) as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) (Pt&#8208;F) as a coordination acceptor. The photo&#8208;triggered reversible transformation between the ring&#8208;open and ring&#8208;closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR, 31P&#8197;NMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This unique property enabled a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remained structurally intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. The photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get the glow&lt;/b&gt;: Photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance are constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) as a coordination acceptor via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance have been constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (&lt;b&gt;BTE&lt;/b&gt;) as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) (&lt;b&gt;Pt&#8208;F&lt;/b&gt;) as a coordination acceptor. The photo&#8208;triggered reversible transformation between the ring&#8208;open and ring&#8208;closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P&#8197;NMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This unique property enabled a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remained structurally intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. The photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Postsynthetic&#8208;Modified PANI/MOF Composites with Tunable Thermoelectric and Photoelectric Properties</title>

SC&#8208;SC PSM: Postsynthetic single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal modification of metal&#8211;organic framework Co&#8208;MOF with electrically conducting EtpyBr and photoconductive AgNO3 produced Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF. Incorporation of conductive polyaniline (PANI) into these MOF matrices yielded three PANI/MOFs with outstanding conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). PANI/Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and PANI/Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF show enhanced Seebeck coefficient and photocurrent density, respectively.







Abstract
A 3D Co&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Co&#8208;MOF) with two kinds of large pores filled by free Co2+ ions and ligands was synthesized and characterized. To expand the MOF structure and conductivity, the free Co2+ ions and ligands were exchanged by conductive ionic liquid EtpyBr and photosensitive AgNO3 through single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal transformation, which produced structure&#8208;changed 3D MOFs Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF, which were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Incorporating small quantities of doped polyaniline (PANI) with redox activity into the pores could further tune the stability and conductivity of the three MOFs. The PANI/MOFs all show outstanding electrical conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and PANI/Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br has the largest p&#8208;type Seebeck coefficient of 66.6&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;K&#8722;1. PANI/Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and PANI/Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF have 4 and 15 times higher photocurrent density compared with PANI/Co&#8208;MOF, respectively. This work sheds light on the design of advanced electrically conductive 3D MOFs.

         <title>Mimicking Biological Recognition: Lessons in Binding Hydrophilic Guests in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic guests are particularly challenging to selectively bind in water, but selective recognition of hydrophilic molecules is vital in biological processes. In this Review, strategies to develop synthetic receptors that address this challenge are highlighted, with application to nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This body of work provides general insights as well as future directions for the field.







Abstract
Selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic guests in water plays a fundamental role in a vast number of biological processes, but synthetic mimicry of biomolecular recognition in water still proves challenging both in terms of achieving comparable affinities and selectivities. This Review highlights strategies that have been developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry to selectively and non&#8208;covalently bind three classes of biologically relevant molecules: nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. As several groups have systematically modified receptors for a specific guest, an evolutionary perspective is also provided in some cases. Trends in the most effective binding forces for each class are described, providing insight into selectivity and potential directions for future work.

         <title>Photoinduced DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;Linking by 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biphenyl Analogues: Substituents and Leaving Groups Combine to Determine the Efficiency of Cross&#8208;Linker</title>

DNA cross&#8208;linking: Two series of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L=OAc, OCH3, OCHCH=CH2, OCH2Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph3P+) are synthesized and their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism are investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent.







Abstract
Two series of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L=OAc, OCH3, OCHCH=CH2, OCH2Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph3P+) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350&#8197;nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depended on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8211;43&#8201;%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (2&#8201;a), ether (2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;c), or triphenylphosphonium salt (2&#8201;g) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8776;30&#8201;%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Selective Mannich Reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones with Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Imino Ester: Divergent Synthesis of Cyclocanaline and Tetrahydro Pyridazinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two roads diverged: Direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;selective Mannich reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with cyclic &#945;&#8208;imino ester is realized by a dinuclear zinc catalyst giving Mannich adducts with high enantioselectivity. These products could be used as common intermediates in the synthesis of multisubstituted cyclocanalines, tetrahydro pyridazinones, and 4H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]benzoxazine derivatives.







Abstract
The first regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective direct Mannich reaction of &#946;,&#947;,&#8208;unsaturated ketones with benzoxazinone cyclic imines was enabled by Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base cooperative catalysis. The dinuclear zinc complex catalyzed the reaction of a broad range of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones to proceed at the &#945;&#8208;site exclusively, leading to corresponding adducts with two consecutive tertiary carbon stereocenters in diastereomeric ratios of up to &gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities generally in the 90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee range. These products were used as general intermediates in the synthesis of multisubstituted cyclocanalines, tetrahydro pyridazinones, and 4H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]benzoxazine derivatives.

         <title>Potential Applications of Cucurbit[n]urils and Their Derivatives in the Capture of Hazardous Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be their guest! Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s), consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups, have a rigid hydrophobic inner cavity and two polar outer portals lined with carbonyl groups, so Q[n]s not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity, but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters. This Minireview focuses on the recent advances in the potential application of Q[n]s and their derivatives for the capture and adsorption of hazardous chemicals.







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) are a relatively young family of macrocycles, consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups, and their unique structures have attracted extensive attention from chemists in recent decades. Due to the presence of a rigid hydrophobic inner cavity and two polar outer portals lined with carbonyl groups, Q[n]s not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity, but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters. Considerable achievements have been obtained in the fields of Q[n]s&#8208;based host&#8211;guest chemistry, coordination chemistry, as well as the combination of host&#8211;guest and coordination chemistry. Furthermore, the outer surface of Q[n]s has been demonstrated to be capable of interacting with definite species to generate supramolecular architectures in recent years. With more in&#8208;depth research into Q[n]s, their application studies have also emerged as a hot topic. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the potential applications of solid&#8208;state materials based on Q[n]s and their derivatives for the capture and adsorption of hazardous chemicals from a solution or a gas mixture.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Nanomaterials Toward Efficient Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, the advanced progress of polyoxometalate&#8208;based nanomaterials for cancer diagnosis and therapy including magnetic resonance imaging, biological nanoprobes, photothermal therapy, radiotherapy, chemodynamic therapy and multimodal imaging&#8208;guided combined therapy are summarized.







Abstract
As an emerging class of inorganic metal oxides, organically functionalized polyoxometalates (POMs) or POM&#8208;based nanohybrids have been demonstrated promising potential for the inhibition of various cancer types by the virtue of their diversity in structures and significantly reduced toxicity. This contribution summarizes the latest achievement of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials in cancer diagnosis and various therapeutics to put forward our fundamental viewpoints on the design principles of modified POMs based on their application. In addition, major challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed. We expect that this review will provide a valuable and systematic reference for the further development of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin&#8197;B: Study of the Challenging &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylations**

Selective synthe&#8208;cis: The total synthesis of tiacumicin&#8197;B has been achieved. Through the combined use of a phenylsulfoxide leaving&#8208;group and a remote 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group on the donors, we have solved the problem of 1,2&#8208;cis glycosylation and reached remarkable facial &#946;&#8208;selectivity relying on an H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed effect.







Abstract
We give a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin&#8197;B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin&#8197;B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosylation steps. We used sulfoxide anomeric leaving&#8208;groups in combination with a remote 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group on the donors that allowed highly &#946;&#8208;selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery. The rhamnosylated C1&#8211;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8211;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size&#8208;selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semiglycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2&#8208;naphthylmethyl ether on a phenol, and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin&#8197;B.

         <title>The Effect of Auxiliary Nitrogenated Linkers on the Design of New Cadmium&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Sensors for the Detection of Explosive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast explosive detection: New luminescent cadmium&#8208;based coordination polymers are presented. The nature of the ligand has a strong influence on the light&#8208;emitting properties of these materials. Their remarkable sensitivity and selectivity to highly explosive picric acid or nitrophenol together with their excellent recyclability render them promising candidates for the detection of explosives, where fast responses are needed.







Abstract
Three new cadmium&#8208;based coordination polymers, denoted [Cd(hfipbb)(4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipy)] (CdPF&#8208;1), [Cd(hfipbb)(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipy)] (CdPF&#8208;2), and [Cd(hfipbb)(1,10&#8208;phen)] (CdPF&#8208;3), have been hydrothermally synthesized by using the well&#8208;known V&#8208;shaped organic linker 4,4&#8217;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfipbb), together with different nitrogenated auxiliary linkers. Considering the d10 configuration of the transition metal selected, the luminescent properties for these CdPF&#8208;n materials were explored, finding that materials CdPF&#8208;2 and CdPF&#8208;3 act as excellent sensors in the detection of explosive nitro aromatic compounds. The photoluminescence properties of CdPF&#8208;2 and CdPF&#8208;3 revealed that significant and sensitive fluorescence quenching was observed toward NP (nitrophenol) for CdPF&#8208;2 and PA (picric acid) for CdPF&#8208;3 in MeOH suspensions.

         <title>Divergent Carbocatalytic Routes in Oxidative Coupling of Benzofused Heteroaryl Dimers: A Mechanistic Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative coupling of benzofused heteroaryl dimers proceeded via divergent mechanistic routes depending on the used substrate and carbocatalyst. DFT level calculations using molecular quinones to compare the thermodynamics between radical and arenium cationic pathways rationalized the experimental behaviour of 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole: HNO3 oxidized active carbon (AC) catalyst yielded carbazole derivative while air oxidized AC yielded COTs.







Abstract
Mildly thermal air or HNO3 oxidized activated carbons catalyse oxidative dehydrogenative couplings of benzo[b]fused heteroaryl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimers, e.g., 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole, to chiral 3,3&#8217;&#8208;coupled cyclooctatetraenes or carbazole&#8208;type migrative products under O2 atmosphere. DFT calculations show that the radical cation and the Scholl&#8208;type arenium cation mechanisms lead to different products with 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole, being in accord with experimental product distributions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mildly thermal air or HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oxidized activated carbons catalyse oxidative dehydrogenative couplings of benzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]fused heteroaryl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimers, e.g., 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indole, to chiral 3,3&#8217;&#8208;coupled cyclooctatetraenes or carbazole&#8208;type migrative products under O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. DFT calculations show that the radical cation and the Scholl&#8208;type arenium cation mechanisms lead to different products with 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indole, being in accord with experimental product distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interaction of Hydrogen with Ceria: Hydroxylation, Reduction, and Hydride Formation on the Surface and in the Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first attempt to establish the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) has been carried out by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk.







Abstract
The study reports the first attempt to address the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk. We show that, on a stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface, H2 dissociates and forms surface hydroxyls (OH). On the pre&#8208;reduced CeO2&#8722;x samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (Ce&#8722;H) are formed on the surface as well as in the bulk, accompanied by the Ce3+ &#8596; Ce4+ redox reaction. As the Ov concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surface hydroxyls can react to produce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, increasing its concentration, which controls the H2/CeO2 interaction. The results demonstrate a large diversity of reaction pathways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria&#8208;based catalysts in a hydrogen&#8208;rich atmosphere.

         <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Spin density guidelines: Characterization of T1 polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) reveals that spin density localizes on specific substructures, according to a hierarchy of motifs. A set of general guidelines is defined, allowing prediction of the location of spin density and Baird&#8208;antiaromaticity in PBHs of varying topology and, in addition, prediction of relative T1 energies and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited&#8208;state compounds. Herein, the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin&#8208;density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state is studied. Although a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, a set of guidelines is defined to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components, and subsequently tested on larger systems.

         <title>Chlorophyll&#8208;Based Organic Heterojunction on Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking schemes: Inspired by the interesting Z&#8208;scheme process, herein a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction employing chlorophyll derivatives, Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with two&#8208;dimensional accordion&#8208;like morphology, forming the Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx composite, is demonstrated.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme process is a photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer pathway in natural oxygenic photosynthesis involving electron transport from photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) to photosystem&#8197;I (PSI). Inspired by the interesting Z&#8208;scheme process, herein a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) employing chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives, Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with two&#8208;dimensional accordion&#8208;like morphology, forming Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx composite, is demonstrated. Due to the frontier molecular orbital energy alignments of Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, sublayer Chl&#8208;1 is a simulation of PSI, whereas upper layer Chl&#8208;2 is equivalent to PSII, and the resultant electron transport can take place from Chl&#8208;2 to Chl&#8208;1. Under the illumination of visible light (&gt;420&#8197;nm), the HER performance of Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was found to be as high as 143&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which was substantially higher than that of photocatalysts of either Chl&#8208;1@Ti3C2Tx (20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) or Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx (15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1).

Structure, sequence, spin: The structures of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons are analyzed in terms of the sequence of tricyclic annulations, revealing regularities in the location of spin density and Baird&#8208;antiaromaticity. The two properties localize onto specific tri&#8208; and tetracyclic substructures according to a hierarchy: linear, zig&#8208;zag, curved. The same preferences are reflected in the relative energy of the T1 systems and in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Gershoni&#8208;Poranne et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005248).

         <title>Ox&#8208;SLIM: Synthesis of and Site&#8208;Specific Labelling with a Highly Hydrophilic Trityl Spin Label</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxylated trityl spin label for proteins, called OxSLIM was synthesized. Given its high hydrophilicity, outstanding bioresistance, and short linkage, it combines the most recent advances in just a single molecule. Moreover, its improved relaxation behaviour allows for highly sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)&#8208;based distance measurements down to concentrations as low as 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The combination of pulsed dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) with site&#8208;directed spin labelling is a powerful tool in structural biology. Rational design of trityl&#8208;based spin labels has enabled studying biomolecular structures at room temperature and within cells. However, most current trityl spin labels suffer either from aggregation with proteins due to their hydrophobicity, or from bioconjugation groups not suitable for in&#8208;cell measurements. Therefore, we introduce here the highly hydrophilic trityl spin label Ox&#8208;SLIM. Engineered as a short&#8208;linked maleimide, it combines the most recent developments in one single molecule, as it does not aggregate with proteins, exhibits high resistance under in&#8208;cell conditions, provides a short linker, and allows for selective and efficient spin labelling via cysteines. Beyond establishing synthetic access to Ox&#8208;SLIM, its suitability as a spin label is illustrated and ultimately, highly sensitive PDS measurements are presented down to protein concentrations as low as 45&#8197;nm resolving interspin distances of up to 5.5&#8197;nm.

         <title>Hierarchical Spin&#8208;Crossover Cooperativity in Hybrid 1D Chains of FeII&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Trimers Linked by [Au(CN)2]&#8722; Bridges</title>

Hierarchical cooperativity: Crucial information on the nature, magnitude, and dimensional hierarchy of elastic coupling in spin&#8208;crossover systems is achieved in a family of materials consisting of trimers linked into coordination chains and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests.







Abstract
Foremost, practical applications of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) materials require control of the nature of the spin&#8208;state coupling. In existing SCO materials, there is a single, well&#8208;defined dimensionality relevant to the switching behavior. A new material, consisting of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;based trimers coordinated into 1D chains by [Au(CN)2]&#8722; and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests, underwent SCO defined by elastic coupling across multiple dimensional hierarchies. Detailed structural, vibrational, and theoretical studies conclusively confirmed that intra&#8208;trimer coupling was an order of magnitude greater than the intramolecular coupling, which was an order of magnitude greater than intermolecular coupling. As such, a clear hierarchy on the nature of elastic coupling in SCO materials was ascertained for the first time, which is a necessary step for the technological development of molecular switching materials.

         <title>Diazapentacenes from Quinacridones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piecing together a diazaacene: Starting from linear cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;quinacridones, the synthesis, characteristics and stability of four diazapentacenes are reported leading to a design rule for 12,14&#8208;alkynylated heteroacenes for organic electronics (see figure).







Abstract
Bis(silylethynylated) 5,7&#8208; and 5,12&#8208;diazapentacenes were synthesized from cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;quinacridone using protection, alkynylation and deoxygenation. The solid&#8208;state packing of the targets is determined by choice and position of the silylethynyl substituents. The position of the substituents and nitrogen atoms influence the optical properties of the targets.

         <title>HNO to NO Conversion Mechanism with Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase, Comparison with Heme Protein Mediated Conversions, and the Origin of Questionable Reversibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Similarities and differences: This reaction is important for NO formation and HNO detection. Calculations provide the first theoretical mechanistic information on the nonheme protein mediated process and many previously unknown mechanistic similarities and differences compared with those of conversions mediated by heme proteins. Importantly, the first kinetically feasible and thermodynamically favorable mechanism is shown.







Abstract
The interconversion of NO and HNO, via copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), is important in biomedicine and for HNO detection. Many mechanistic questions, including the decades&#8208;long debate on reversibility, were resolved in this work. Calculations of various active&#8208;site and full&#8208;protein models show that the basic mechanism is proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with a computed barrier of 10.98&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is in excellent agreement with experimental results (10.62&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and this nonheme protein&#8208;mediated reaction has many significant mechanistic differences compared with the conversions mediated by heme proteins due to geometric and electronic factors. The reasons for the irreversible nature of this conversion and models with the first thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible mechanism for the experimental reverse reaction were discovered. Such results are the first for nonheme enzyme mediated HNO to NO conversions, which shall facilitate other related studies and HNO probe development.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Functionalized Core&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Micelles and Nanogels with a Polycationic Outer Shell: Synthesis and Application in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Biphasic Hydrogenations</title>

Pretty polly: Stable latexes of size&#8208;controlled spherical and unimolecular polymers, made of a cross&#8208;linked and phosphine&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic core and a poly(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinylpyridinium) shell, are efficient nanoreactors for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation under aqueous biphasic conditions with excellent recyclability and negligible levels of leaching.







Abstract
Unimolecular amphiphilic nanoreactors with a poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (P4VPMe+I&#8722;) polycationic outer shell and two different architectures (core&#8208;cross&#8208;linked micelles, CCM, and nanogels, NG), with narrow size distributions around 130&#8211;150&#8197;nm in diameter, were synthesized by RAFT polymerization from an R0&#8208;4VPMe+I&#8722;140&#8208;b&#8208;S50&#8208;SC(S)SPr macroRAFT agent by either chain extension with a long (300 monomer units) hydrophobic polystyrene&#8208;based block followed by cross&#8208;linking with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA) for the CCM particles, or by simultaneous chain extension and cross&#8208;linking for the NG particles. A core&#8208;anchored triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligand functionality was introduced by using 4&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene (DPPS) as a comonomer (5&#8211;20&#8201;%&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) in the chain extension (for CCM) or chain extension/cross&#8208;linking (for NG) step. The products were directly obtained as stable colloidal dispersions in water (latexes). After loading with [RhCl(COD)]2 to yield [RhCl(COD)(TPP@CCM)] or [RhCl(COD)(TPP@NG)], respectively, the polymers were used as polymeric nanoreactors in Rh&#8208;catalyzed aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of the model substrates styrene and 1&#8208;octene, either neat (for styrene) or in an organic solvent (toluene or 1&#8208;nonanol). All hydrogenations were rapid (TOF up to 300&#8197;h&#8722;1) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar of H2 pressure, the biphasic mixture rapidly decanted at the end of the reaction (&lt;2&#8197;min), the Rh loss was negligible (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm in the recovered organic phase), and the catalyst phase could be recycled 10 times without significant loss of catalytic activity.

A core&#8208;anchored triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligand functionality was introduced by using 4&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene (DPPS) as a comonomer (5&#8211;20&#8201;%&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in the chain extension (for CCM) or chain extension/cross&#8208;linking (for NG) step. The products were directly obtained as stable colloidal dispersions in water (latexes). After loading with [RhCl(COD)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield [RhCl(COD)(TPP@CCM)] or [RhCl(COD)(TPP@NG)], respectively, the polymers were used as polymeric nanoreactors in Rh&#8208;catalyzed aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of the model substrates styrene and 1&#8208;octene, either neat (for styrene) or in an organic solvent (toluene or 1&#8208;nonanol). All hydrogenations were rapid (TOF up to 300&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, the biphasic mixture rapidly decanted at the end of the reaction (&amp;lt;2&#8197;min), the Rh loss was negligible (&amp;lt;0.1&#8197;ppm in the recovered organic phase), and the catalyst phase could be recycled 10 times without significant loss of catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reductive Coupling of (Fluoro)pyridines by Linear 3d&#8208;Metal(I) Silylamides of Cr&#8211;Co: A Tale of C&#8722;C Bond Formation, C&#8722;F Bond Cleavage and a Pyridyl Radical Anion</title>

Now that's radical! The reactions of linear metal(I) complexes (M=Cr&#8211;Fe) with simple pyridines leads to the reductive coupling of the substrates through intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation, which can be reversible, as shown for iron. For fluoropyridines, C&#8722;F bond cleavage is preferred, leading to rare low&#8208;coordinate metal(II) fluorides (see scheme). The structure of a rare 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;free pyridyl radical anion is also presented.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the facile reduction of pyridine (and its derivatives) by linear 3d&#8208;metal(I) silylamides (M=Cr&#8211;Co). This reaction resulted in intermolecular C&#8722;C coupling to give dinuclear metal(II) complexes bearing a bridging 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydrobipyridyl ligand. For iron, we demonstrated that the C&#8722;C coupling is reversible in solution, either directly or by reaction with substrates, via a presumed monomeric metal(II) complex bearing a pyridyl radical anion. In the course of this investigation, we also observed that the dinuclear metal(II) complex incorporating iron facilitated the isomerisation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene as well as equimolar amounts of benzene and cyclohexene. Furthermore, we synthesised and structurally characterised a non&#8208;3d&#8208;metal&#8208;bound pyridyl radical anion. The reactions of the silylamides with perfluoropyridine led to C&#8722;F bond cleavage with the formation of metal(II) fluoride complexes of manganese, iron and cobalt along with the homocoupling or reductive degradation of the substrate. In the case of cobalt, the use of lesser fluorinated pyridines led to C&#8722;F bond cleavage but no homocoupling. Overall, in this paper we provide insights into the multifaceted behaviour of simple (fluoro)pyridines in the presence of moderately to highly reducing metal complexes.

Trapped in ice: A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight MS study provides evidence of the generation of three previously elusive organosilicon molecules in silane&#8211;CO2 ices exposed to energetic electrons. The molecules were also identified through their isotope shifts in deuterated and 18O&#8208;substituted samples. PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS should help identify further complex silicon molecules that cannot be identified by traditional methods.







Abstract
The identification of silicon&#8208;substituted, complex organics carrying multiple functional groups by classical infrared spectroscopy is challenging because the group frequencies of functional groups often overlap. Photoionization (PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;fight mass spectrometry (ReTOF&#8208;MS) in combination with temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) holds certain advantages because molecules are identified after sublimation from the matrix into in the gas phase based on distinct ionization energies and sublimation temperatures. In this study, we reveal the detection of 1&#8208;silaglycolaldehyde (HSiOCH2OH), 2&#8208;sila&#8208;acetic acid (H3SiCOOH), and 1,2&#8208;disila&#8208;acetaldehyde (H3SiSiHO)&#8212;the silicon analogues of the well&#8208;known glycolaldehyde (HCOCH2OH), acetic acid (H3CCOOH), and acetaldehyde (H3CCHO), in the gas phase after preparation in silane (SiH4)&#8211;carbon dioxide ices exposed to energetic electrons and subliming the neutral reaction products formed within the ices into the gas phase.

         <title>Applications of Low&#8208;Melting&#8208;Point Metals in Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;melting&#8208;point metals: Alloying chemistry affords high Li/Na/K content per formula and therefore high capacities. In particular, metals with low melting points (LMP) are thermodynamically preferable for the electrochemical alloying process, some of which also exhibit high flexibility, ductility, or even fluidity, which facilitates electrode fabrication. This minireview summarizes the recent progress of typical LMP metals such as In, Ga, and Hg in rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Low&#8208;melting&#8208;point (LMP) metals represent an interesting family of electrode materials owing to their high ionic conductivity, good ductility or fluidity, low hardness and/or superior alloying capability, all of which are crucial characteristics to address battery challenges such as interfacial incompatibility, electrode pulverization, and dendrite growth. This minireview summarizes recent research progress of typical LMP metals including In, Ga, Hg, and their alloys in rechargeable metal batteries. Emphasis is placed on mainstream electrochemical storage devices of Li, Na, and K batteries as well as the representative multi&#8208;valent metal batteries. The fundamental correlations between unique physiochemical properties of LMP metals and the battery performance are highlighted. In addition, this article also provides insights into future development and potential directions of LMP metals/alloys for practical applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Photophysical Properties of a New Class of Inherently Chiral Boron(III) Chelates&#8212;The tert&#8208;Leucine Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral boron(III) chelates form under mild conditions from tert&#8208;leucine derivatives without needing resolution of diastereoisomers. These weakly fluorescent complexes possess two chiral centres, namely the B(III) atom and the C atom imported with the leucine fragment, and full stereochemical assignment is made by CD spectroscopy. X&#8208;ray structures show a distorted geometry at the B(III) site, with the crystal exhibiting amplified emission.







Abstract
A new family of boron(III) chelates is introduced whereby molecular chirality, confirmed by circular dichroism, is imported during synthesis such that isolation of the diastereoisomers does not require separation procedures. The photophysical properties of two members of the family have been examined: the N,O,O&#8208;salicylaldehyde&#8208;based derivative shows pronounced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character in fluid solution and is weakly fluorescent, with a large Stokes shift. The corresponding 2&#8208;methylamino&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8208;derived N,N,O&#8208;chelate absorbs and fluoresces in the visible region with a much smaller Stokes shift. Orange fluorescence is also observed for this compound as a cast film. Temperature&#8208;dependence studies show that decay of the fluorescent state is weakly activated but emission is less than quantitative at 77&#8197;K. Quite rare for boron(III)&#8208;based chelates, this derivative undergoes intersystem crossing to form a meta&#8208;stable triplet&#8208;excited state. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are reported for both compounds, along with simulated ECD spectra.

         <title>Merging Pd0/PdII Redox and PdII/PdII Non&#8208;redox Catalytic Cycles for the Allylarylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles enables an allylarylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with aryl boronates and allylic carbonates to allow access to a wide variety of carbon skeletons.







Abstract
An allylarylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with aryl boronates and allylic carbonates has been developed. This method allows access to a wide variety of carbon skeletons from readily available starting materials. Mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is enabled by a cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles.

Containers of chemical species: The painting illustrates a bottle and a vase containing chemical species. In a bottle, like in the case of SAPO&#8208;18 and similar structures, the species that are larger than the bottleneck cannot exit and remain trapped inside (ship in a bottle). Contrariwise, in a vase with no bottleneck, like in the case of ZSM&#8208;5 and similar structures, these species can exit and few remain trapped.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Postfunctionalization of Dye Layers on TiO2 &#8212; A Tool for Enhancing Injection in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered approach to capture the sun: We present a sequential covalent/non&#8208;covalent functionalization pathway for metal oxide nanoparticles. Initially a first ligand layer is attached via covalent anchoring of carboxylates, followed by a highly versatile addition of a second dye layer via hydrogen bonding. The resulting hierarchical hybrid architectures were investigated regarding their photophysical properties and finally implemented in sandwich&#8208;type dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) configurations, resulting in an efficiency increase of up to 43&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report on newly tailored dye layers, which were employed, on one hand, for covalent deposition and, on the other hand, for non&#8208;covalently post&#8208;functionalizing TiO2 nanoparticle films. Our functionalization concept enabled intermixing a stable covalent attachment of a first layer with a highly versatile and reversible hydrogen bonding through the Hamilton receptor&#8211;cyanuric acid binding motif as a second layer. Following this concept, we integrated step&#8208;by&#8208;step a first porphyrin layer and a second porphyrin/BODIPY layer. The individual building blocks and their corresponding combinations were probed with regard to their photophysical properties, and the most promising combinations were implemented in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Relative to the first porphyrin layer adding the second porphyrin/BODIPY layers increased the overall DSSC efficiency by up to 43&#8201;%.

         <title>Spin State Tunes Oxygen Atom Transfer towards FeIVO Formation in FeII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin control: The formation of oxoiron(IV) complexes by the reaction of iron(II) precursors bearing tetradentate N ligands with IO4&#8722; occurs through a fast spin&#8208;crossover pre&#8208;equilibrium followed by rate&#8208;determining substitution to form an intermediate that leads rapidly to the FeIV=O species. The experimental kinetic and activation parameters highlight a key role played the spin in controlling the reaction.







Abstract
Oxoiron(IV) complexes bearing tetradentate ligands have been extensively studied as models for the active oxidants in non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzymes. These species are commonly generated by oxidation of their ferrous precursors. The mechanisms of these reactions have seldom been investigated. In this work, the reaction kinetics of complexes [FeII(CH3CN)2L](SbF6)2 ([1](SbF6)2 and [2](SbF6)2) and [FeII(CF3SO3)2L] ([1](OTf)2 and [2](OTf)2 (1, L=Me,HPytacn; 2, L=nP,HPytacn; R,R&#8242;Pytacn=1&#8208;[(6&#8208;R&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]&#8208;4,7&#8208; di&#8208;R&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane) with Bu4NIO4 to form the corresponding [FeIV(O)(CH3CN)L]2+ (3, L=Me,HPytacn; 4, L=nP,HPytacn) species was studied in acetonitrile/acetone at low temperatures. The reactions occur in a single kinetic step with activation parameters independent of the nature of the anion and similar to those obtained for the substitution reaction with Cl&#8722; as entering ligand, which indicates that formation of [FeIV(O)(CH3CN)L]2+ is kinetically controlled by substitution in the starting complex to form [FeII(IO4)(CH3CN)L]+ intermediates that are converted rapidly to oxo complexes 3 and 4. The kinetics of the reaction is strongly dependent on the spin state of the starting complex. A detailed analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and kinetic data for the triflate complexes reveals that the experimental values of the activation parameters for both complexes are the result of partial compensation of the contributions from the thermodynamic parameters for the spin&#8208;crossover equilibrium and the activation parameters for substitution. The observation of these opposite and compensating effects by modifying the steric hindrance at the ligand illustrates so far unconsidered factors governing the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer leading to high&#8208;valent iron oxo species.

         <title>Modulating Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Interfaces on Nickel&#8211;Copper Double Hydroxide Nanotyres to Pre&#8208;activate Alkaline Ammonia Oxidation Reactivity</title>

The more the merrier: Hierarchical porous NiCu double hydroxide nanotyres (NiCu DHTs) with hydroxyl&#8208;rich interfaces are designed to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency, exhibiting excellent activity, stability, and sensitivity for the ammonia oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The surface hydroxyl groups of NixCu1&#8722;x(OH)2 play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8722;xOx(OH)2&#8722;x during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, the rational design of hierarchical porous NiCu double hydroxide nanotyres (NiCu DHTs) was reported for the first time by considering hydroxyl&#8208;rich interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e., annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;function relationship was conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31&#8197;V with 7.52&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#8197;V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9&#8197;&#956;m), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors. This work deepens the understanding of the crucial role of surface hydroxyl groups on determining the catalytic performance in alkaline medium.

         <title>Metal Sulfide Nanoparticles: Precursor Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation on large scales: Precursor&#8211;solvent combinations used to produce metal sulfide nanoparticles through multiple pathways are discussed herein. The production of metal sulfide nanoparticles, which are valuable in a plethora of applications, is discussed and it is highlighted how the establishment of new methods will help to standardize and increase production capabilities.







Abstract
Fascination with and the need for evermore increasing efficiency, power, or strength have been the cornerstones for developing new materials and methods for their creation. Higher solar cell conversion efficiencies, increased battery storage power, and lightweight strong materials are some that have been at the forefront of attention for these efforts. Materials created for most applications start as simple chemical compounds. A study of how these chemicals have been used in the past can be used to create new materials and new methods of production. Herein, a class of materials that are valuable in a multitude of applications, metal sulfide nanoparticles, are examined, along with how they are being produced and how new methods can be established that will help to standardize and increase production capabilities. Precursor&#8211;solvent combinations that can be used to create metal sulfide nanoparticles in the gas phase are also explored.

Nickela&#8208;electrothiolation: A nascent co&#8208;operation between nickel catalysis and electrochemical synthesis to bring forth cross&#8208;electrophile thiolation of alkyl bromides.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing molecules are of utmost topical importance towards the effective development of pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we present an efficient and mild electrochemical thiolation by cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl bromides with functionalized bench&#8208;stable thiosulfonates to access alkyl sulfides with excellent efficacy and broad functional group tolerance. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic analysis were performed to elucidate mechanistic insights into this electrocatalytic thiolation reaction.

         <title>Mediated Generation of Conjugate Acid by UV and Blue Sensitizers with Upconversion Nanoparticles at 980&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make it acidic with long wavelength invisible light: Upconversion nanoparticles generate blue and UV light needed to excite a sensitizer absorbing in the UV or blue whose reaction with an onium salt results in conjugate acid. Rhodamine B lactone helps to quantify it and gives a drawback for initiation of cationic polymerization. Different efficiencies were found appearing in distinct deep red color.







Abstract
NIR and UV exposure of systems comprising upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) based on NaYF4:Tm/Yb@NaYF4, a sensitizer absorbing either in the blue or UV region, and an onium salt with weak coordinating anion resulted in formation of conjugate acid (con&#8208;H+). That was namely Ivocerin (di(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)diethylgermane), ITX (2&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl thioxanthone), anthracene, pyrene, rubrene, camphore quinone, and a strong fluorescent coumarin (1,1,6,6,8&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahyhdro&#8208;1H,4H&#8208;11&#8208;oxa&#8208;3a&#8208;aza&#8208;benzo[de]anthracene&#8208;10&#8208;one). Quantification occurred by treatment with Rhodamine B lactone whose color switched to intensive red after photolytic formation of con&#8208;H+. Exposure with a NIR laser at 980&#8197;nm resulted in less con&#8208;H+ compared to 395&#8197;nm where all sensitizers absorb radiation. UCNP did not mainly interfered formation of con&#8208;H+. The different rates obtained in both experiments responsibly explain the failure and success to initiate polymerization of epoxides applying ether 980&#8197;nm or 395&#8197;nm excitation, respectively.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Diene with Amine and Disilane under a Mild Re&#8208;oxidation System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a one&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds under base, acid, and ligand&#8208;free conditions using molecular oxygen as terminal re&#8208;oxidant. This reaction provided allylic silane including allylic amine framework along with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity via oxidative amination mechanism.







Abstract
A highly regioselective and stereoselective difunctionalization reaction of 1,3&#8208;diene with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds via a one&#8208;step Pd/Cu/O2 system is disclosed. The difunctionalization reaction affords allylic silanes, including the allylic amine moiety, in up to 92&#8201;% yield in the absence of any acid, base, or external ligand. The developed synthetic methodology can be scaled to 100&#8197;g in high yield with high Z&#8208;selectivity, which demonstrates the feasibility of the reaction for industrial applications.

         <title>Mixed Organometallic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Assemblies Based on the Diarsene Complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;As2)], AgI Salts and N&#8208;Donor Organic Molecules</title>

Hybrid coordination polymers: The AgI monomer [Ag{[Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)]}3][TEF] ([TEF]=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]) was obtained by reaction of the organometallic diarsene complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)] with Ag[TEF]. In solution, this compound is in equilibrium with another monomeric species, [Ag{[Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)]}2][TEF], exhibiting a less&#8208;saturated AgI center. This solution mixture reacts with a variety of ditopic pyridine&#8208;based organic linkers to afford selectively 1D and 2D organometallic&#8208;organic hybrid assemblies, including a helix&#8208;like 1D structure.







Abstract
The reaction of the organometallic diarsene complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)] (1) with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (Ag[TEF]) yielded the AgI monomer [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;1)3][TEF] (2). This compound exhibits dynamic behavior in solution, which allows directed selective synthesis of unprecedented organometallic&#8211;organic hybrid assemblies upon its reaction with N&#8208;donor organic molecules by a stepwise pathway, which is supported by DFT calculations. Accordingly, the reaction of 2 with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrimidine (L1) yielded the dicationic molecular compound [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)2Ag}2(&#956;&#8208;L1)][TEF]2 (3) or the 1D polymer [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}(&#956;&#8208;L1)]n[TEF]n (4) depending on the ratio of the reactants. However, its reactions with the pyridine&#8208;based linkers 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (L2), 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (L3) and 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne (L4) allowed the formation of the 2D polymers [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}2(&#956;&#8208;Lx)3]n[TEF]2n [Lx=L2 (5), L3 (6), L4 (7), respectively]. Additionally, this concept was extended to step&#8208;by&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reactions of 1, [Ag(CH3CN)3][Al{OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4] ([Ag(CH3CN)3][TEFCl]) and linkers L2&#8211;L4 to produce the 2D polymers [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}2(&#956;,Lx)3]n[TEFCl]2n [Lx=L2 (8), L3 (9), L4 (10), respectively].

         <title>The Combined Use of Gold Nanoparticles and Infrared Radiation Enables Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold run: The inability of most proteins to transverse the cellular membrane hampers the development of protein therapeutics for intracellular targets. In this work, we describe the use of catalytic amounts of gold nanorods combined with near infrared laser irradiation as a strategy to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery remains elusive. The inability of most proteins to cross the cellular membrane is a huge hurdle. Here we explore the unique photothermal properties of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins. Both partners, protein and AuNRs, are modified with a protease&#8208;resistant cell&#8208;penetrating peptide with nuclear targeting properties to induce internalization. Once internalized, spatiotemporal control of protein release is achieved by near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation in the safe second biological window. Importantly, catalytic amounts of AuNRs are sufficient to trigger cytosolic protein delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that AuNRs with their maximum of absorption in the second biological window are used to deliver proteins into the intracellular space. This strategy represents a powerful tool for the cytosolic delivery of virtually any class of protein.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture and Utilization with Isomeric Forms of Bis(amino)&#8208;Tagged Zinc Bipyrazolate Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural ZnII MOFs built with isomeric forms of diamino&#8208;tagged 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazolate linkers have been prepared and exploited in CCS/CCU applications. They are good CO2 adsorbents (because of the basic &#8722;NH2 groups) and better CO2 epoxidation catalysts if compared with their mono&#8208;amino analogue.







Abstract
Aiming at extending the tagged zinc bipyrazolate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) family, the ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (3,3&#8217;&#8208;H2L) has been synthesized in good yield. The reaction with zinc(II) acetate hydrate led to the related MOF Zn(3,3&#8217;&#8208;L). The compound is isostructural with its mono(amino) analogue Zn(BPZNH2) and with Zn(3,5&#8208;L), its isomeric parent built with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole. The textural analysis has unveiled its micro&#8208;/mesoporous nature, with a BET area of 463&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Its CO2 adsorption capacity (17.4&#8197;wt.&#8201;% CO2 at pCO2 = 1&#8197;bar and T = 298&#8197;K) and isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst = 24.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) are comparable to that of Zn(3,5&#8208;L). Both Zn(3,3&#8217;&#8208;L) and Zn(3,5&#8208;L) have been tested as heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction of CO2 with the epoxides epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin to give the corresponding cyclic carbonates at T = 393&#8197;K and pCO2 = 5&#8197;bar under solvent&#8208; and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. In general, the conversions recorded are higher than those found for Zn(BPZNH2), proving that the insertion of an extra amino tag in the pores is beneficial for the epoxidation catalysis. The best catalytic match has been observed for the Zn(3,5&#8208;L)/epichlorohydrin couple, with 64&#8201;% conversion and a TOF of 5.3&#8197;mmol(carbonate)&#8201;(mmolZn)&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. To gain better insights on the MOF&#8208;epoxide interaction, the crystal structure of the [epibromohydrin@Zn(3,3&#8217;&#8208;L)] adduct has been solved, confirming the existence of Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(H)&#8722;N non&#8208;bonding interactions. To our knowledge, this study represents the first structural determination of a [epibromohydrin@MOF] adduct.

         <title>Sensitive and Visual Detection of Phosgene by a TICT&#8208;Based BODIPY Dye with 8&#8208;(o&#8208;Hydroxy)aniline as the Active Site</title>

Sense and sensitivity: The fluorescent probe with 8&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy)phenyl as the active site (o&#8208;Pha) exhibits better sensing performance than the 8&#8208;(3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy)phenyl (o&#8208;Pah). Furthermore, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe (o&#8208;Phae) has been contrasted through extending conjugation of o&#8208;Pha for colorimetric and fluorescent detections of phosgene and its substitutes in both solutions and gas phase.







Abstract
Phosgene and its substitutes (diphosgene and triphosgene) are widely utilized as chemical industrial materials and chemical warfare agents and pose a threat to public health and environmental safety due to their extreme toxicity. Research efforts have been directed to develop selective and sensitive detection methods for phosgene and its substitutes. In this paper, we have prepared two BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes, o&#8208;Pah and o&#8208;Pha, which are two isomers with different active sites, ortho&#8208;aminohydroxy (3&#8242;,4&#8242; or 4&#8242;,3&#8242;) phenyls at meso position of BODIPY, and compared their sensing performance toward triphosgene. The probe with o&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl), o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the o&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl), o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34&#8197;nm vs. 1.2&#8197;nm), and more rapid response (10&#8197;s vs. 200&#8197;s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of o&#8208;Pha. The probe o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60&#8197;s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD=0.88&#8197;nm), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&lt;2&#8197;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.

         <title>Small Figure&#8208;Eight Luminophores: Double&#8208;Twisted Tethered Cyclic Binaphthyls Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In this study, we found that the reported rigid figure&#8208;eight molecules exhibit remarkable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The g&#8208;value of the asymmetry factor, which indicates the degree of polarization in circularly polarized light, was considerably high (gCPL=0.016) compared to other single organic molecules.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

Impossible object in the molecular world: a stereogenic figure&#8208;eight molecule, which exhibits remarkable CPL properties, is depicted in the cover image. Electrons confined to the rigid and twisted molecule contribute greatly to the amplification of CPL in the excited state. The widely delocalized electrons in the molecule are described as if they were cats walking across a mysterious impossible object in the world of M.&#8197;C. Escher.

         <dc:description>
The discovery of new chemical species often reveals novel bonding modes, whose further development represents an urgent task on the interface between fundamental chemistry and materials science. This work reports the synthesis of a hexacoordinated antimony&#8208;centered dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+ and the determination of its solid&#8208;state structure. The picture illustrates that [(ppy)3Sb]2+ is unearthed from crystals of &#8216;stibnite&#8217;, which is a representative naturally occurring antimony ore.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library based on peptide macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives, based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1,254,838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the properties of MOF&#8208;808 via defect engineering and metal nanoparticle encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect engineering and metal&#8208;encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO  2  adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Co3O4/Carbon Heteroaerogels with Ultrahigh Capacitance via Polyethyleneimine Intercalation of Co2BIM4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework Co2BIM4 nanosheets&#8208;based Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC heteroaerogel is developed as a novel supercapacitor electrode through polyethyleneimine intercalation strategy, which shows ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2568&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, remarkable rate capability (1747&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1at a drastically increased current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance preservation of 92.7&#8201;% after 10000&#8201;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs&#8208;derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we developed a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co2BIM4, BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co3O4/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC heteroaerogels were obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co2BIM4 nanosheets and following by carbonizing the resulting Co2BIM4/PEI composite. The Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC electrode possessed 3D conductive framework with an overlapped hetero&#8208;interface and expanded interlayers, leading to fast and stable charge transfer/diffusion and an enhanced pseudocapacitance performance. Therefore, the Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC electrode showed ultrahigh capacitance of 2568&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 1747&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and excellent long cycling time with a capacitance preservation of 92.7&#8201;% following 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is very promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.

         <title>Cations and Anions of Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene and Reduction of a Dibenzo[a,e]pentalenophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic character in a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) was observed upon chemical oxidation to the cation radical and dication and reduction to the anion radical, as found from solid&#8208;state structures. In a bent DBP&#8208;phane aromaticity could not be reached upon reduction, and stabilization though proton abstraction occurred.







Abstract
Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a non&#8208;alternant conjugated hydrocarbon with antiaromatic character and ambipolar electrochemical behavior. Upon both reduction and oxidation, it becomes aromatic. We herein study the chemical oxidation and reduction of a planar DBP derivative and a bent DBP&#8208;phane. The molecular structures of its planar dication, cation radical and anion radical in the solid state demonstrate the gained aromaticity through bond length equalization, which is supported by nucleus independent chemical shift&#8208;calculations. EPR spectra on the cation radical confirm the spin delocalization over the DBP framework. A similar delocalization was not possible in the reduced bent DBP&#8208;phane, which stabilized itself by proton abstraction from a solvent molecule upon reduction. This is the first report on structures of a DBP cation radical and dication in the solid state and of a reduced bent DBP derivative. Our study provides valuable insight into the charged species of DBP for its application as semiconductor.

         <title>A Robust Mesoporous Al2O3&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Catalyst for Abundant NOx Storage with Rational Design of Pt and Ba Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocomposite Ba/Pt@Al2O3 catalyst, showing abundant NOx storage property in spherical mesoporous Al2O3 particles, can be rationally designed through one&#8208;pot spray&#8208;drying of a precursor solution containing Pt species and amphiphilic organic molecules followed by impregnation of Ba species after full crystallization of the Al2O3 frameworks during calcination, which is applied for proposing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous catalysts based on synergetic catalytic effects at the nanometer scale.

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superbasic tetraphosphazene is a thieving magpie on the hunt for the shiny proton. Phenols are readily deprotonated and the respective non&#8208;coordinated anions are formed in the presence of weakly Lewis&#8208;acidic phosphazenium counterions. Strongly nucleophilic non&#8208;coordinated phenolates excel as reducing agents for the generation of radical anion salts and for the activation of SF6. Their high Lewis&#8208;basicity is accompanied by a pronounced tendency for hydrogen bonding, which is perceptible in their chemical behavior. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Hoge et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005123).

         <title>Photocatalytic Giese&#8208;Type Reaction with Alkylsilicates Bearing C,O&#8208;Bidentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reaction using alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as stable alkyl radical precursors has been reported. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals but also elusive methyl radicals could be generated using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. Theoretical calculations provide an insight on the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Morofuji, N. Kano et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005300).

Ruby Red: Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed butadiene&#8208;mediated benzannulation enables the first synthesis of 3,10&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl)rubicene and its N&#8208;doped derivatives as well as preliminary studies on their photophysical properties.

         <title>Biological and medical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, e.g. bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, e.g. against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and evaluation of novel ring&#8208;strained noncanonical amino acids for residue&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions in living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions are ideally suited to selectively modify proteins in complex environments, even in vivo. Kinetics and product stability of these reactions are crucial parameters to evaluate their usefulness for specific applications. Strain promoted inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions (SPIEDAC) between tetrazines and strained alkenes or alkynes are particularly popular, as they allow ultrafast labeling inside cells. In combination with genetic code expansion (GCE)&#8212;a method that allows to site&#8208;specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in vivo&#8212;these reactions enable residue&#8208;specific fluorophore attachment to proteins in living mammalian cells. Several SPIEDAC capable ncAAs have been presented and studied under diverse conditions, revealing different instabilities ranging from educt decomposition to product loss due to &#946;&#8208;elimination. To identify which compounds yield the best labeling inside living mammalian cells has frequently been difficult. In this study we present a) the synthesis of four new SPIEDAC reactive ncAAs that cannot undergo &#946;&#8208;elimination and b) a fluorescence flow cytometry based FRET&#8208;assay to measure reaction kinetics inside living cells. Our results, which at first sight can be seen conflicting with some other studies, capture GCE specific experimental conditions&#8212;such as long&#8208;term exposure of the ring&#8208;strained ncAA to living cells&#8212;that are not taken into account in other assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic squaraine dendrimers for background&#8208;free imaging of integrin receptors in cancer cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (~2,300,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (~25%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3 nM) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1&#8208;BR  2  &#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=N]&#8208;C  6  H  4  (  3  &#8208;  6  ) [BR  2  = BMes  2  (  3  ), BC  12  H  8  , (  4  ), BBN (  5  ), BBNO (  6  )] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis. These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8208;H, C&#8208;H, N&#8208;H, O&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H, B&#8208;H and C=O bonds.  4  and  5  deprotonated terminal alkynes to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR  2  )&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]&#8208;C  6  H  4  (R = Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH  2  and pyrrolidine, to generate the adducts 1&#8208;(R  2  HN&#8594;BR  2  )&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]&#8208;C  6  H  4  , where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition,  5  was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H  2  CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise,  5  is capable of cleaving H  2  , HBPin and PhSiH  3  to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family.&#160; In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation&#160; of previously unrecognized sulfur tetra hydride ( C 4v &#8208;symmetric SH 4 ) from &#160;hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) on the ground state potential energy surface.&#160; The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH 4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF 4 ( C 2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. &#160;The distressed character of SH 4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH 4 ) n and mixed (SH 4 &#183;&#183;&#183;H 2 S) n composition. &#160;We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH 4 &#183;&#183;&#183;H 2 S) n &#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH 3 &#8221; stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing multiconfigurational states by spectroscopy:&#160;The cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS spectra of CeO2  and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with&#160;ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed&#160;spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the&#160;relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron&#160;occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO  2  and cerocene&#160;exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction&#160;configurational&#160;composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated&#160;GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements&#160;using peak areas&#160;(nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3&#8208;edge is&#160;rationalized from the perspective&#160;of the relaxed orbitals for the GS and core ESs. The&#160;states&#160;underlying the different peaks&#160;differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1  vs. 4f0  sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene&#160;spectral peaks is associated with&#160;4f2  sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in&#160;terms of Ce IV and III ONs, as long assumed, with Ce II states additionally appearing in the&#160;cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the&#160;accuracy of the conventional&#160;approach to determining  nf  &#160;from Ce L3&#8208;edge, imitations are highlighted in terms of the&#160;ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states.&#160;The need to determine the origins of  nf  &#160;by calculations&#160;is stressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N  2  adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8208;0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH  3  production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Carbonylation of Amines to Oxalamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago which usually need the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. Herein, we describe the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light. Our new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago which usually need the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. Herein, we describe the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light. Our new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that Pd(I) was formed and Pd(0) was the active species. Both nitrogen&#8208; and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catechol&#8208;coordinated framework film&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors with AC line filtering performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymer frameworks (CPFs) have broad applications due to their excellent features, including stable structure, intrinsic porosity, etc. However, preparation of thin film CPFs for energy storage and conversion remains challenge because of poor compatibility between conductive substrates and CPFs and crucial condition for thin film preparation. In this work, a CPF film is prepared by the coordination of the anisotropic four&#8208;armed ligand and Cu(II) at liquid&#8208;liquid interface. Such film based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) is fabricated through high energy scribing and electrolytes soaking. As&#8208;fabricated MSCs display high volumetric specific capacitance of 121.45 F cm  &#8208;3  . Besides, the volumetric energy density of MSCs reaches 52.6 mWh cm  &#8208;3  , which exceeds the electrochemical performance of most reported CPF&#8208;based MSCs. Especially, the device exhibits alternating current (AC) line filtering performance (&#8208;84.2&#176; at 120 Hz) and a short resistance&#8208;capacitance constant of 0.08 ms. This work not only provides a new CPF for MSCs with AC line filtering performance but also paves the way for thin film CPFs preparation with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of MOFs with CAU&#8209;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type framework of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,2,4,6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2, respectively are formed. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), while the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2_np. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Cyano &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alkanes by Light Mediated Single Electron Transfer between Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing &#946;&#8208;aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (  N  &#8208;oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox&#8208;neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal&#8208; or organic&#8208;based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the &#945;&#8208;cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the  N  &#8208;oxy ester is facilitated by blue&#8208;light via their electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. The &#945;&#8208;cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a &#946;&#8208;proton to form a &#960;&#8208;resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic &#946;&#8208;position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal&#8208;free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of  cis  &#8208;aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubsitituted quaternary carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable synthesis of porous SiFe@C composite with excellent lithium storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a novel porous SiFe@C composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including suitable ball milling, partial etching and carbon layer coating. The novel pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase and a uniform carbon layer (12~16 nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilize the SEI film and markedly enhance the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g&#8208;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30%. Meanwhile, it shows larger discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles at 2 and 4 A g&#8208;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a bright prospect for the commercial production of high lithium storage capacity silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling emissive properties by intramolecular hydrogen bonds: alkyl and aryl meso&#8208;substituted porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, fourfold  meso&#8208;  substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents this effect is small. To explain this difference, we synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208; substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208; and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl&#8208; derivatives. Analysis of structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of six porphycenes, combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations shows a clear correlation between the strength of intramolecular NH&#183;&#183;&#183;N H&#8208;bonds and the efficiency of radiationless depopulation of the lowest excited singlet state. This result leads to a model that postulates that delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. Finding of correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N &#8209;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.</dc:description>

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208; t Bu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th(IV) compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8208; fragments. Therefore, although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(II) when reacted with Ph2E2 (E = S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co&#8208;C)&#8208;Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally&#8208;Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how  para&#8208; vs.  meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in  ET  of 0.24 eV in the different media &#8211; sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device &#8211; with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower  ET  values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high  ET  materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in selective oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8208;organic frameworks consisted of 8&#8208;connected Zr  6  &#8208;clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. Low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H  2  O  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One&#8208;Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17&#8208;keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17&#8208;ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side&#8208;chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one&#8208;pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids. In addition, simultaneous anodic C17 side&#8208;chain cleavage and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of a steroid has been demonstrated, rendering a convenient and highly atom economic procedure for the synthesis of saturated androgens</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide in toluene at 60 &#176;C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac&#8208;lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191 &#176;C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination&#8208;insertion mechanism with the carbene&#8208;phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the &#8211;OH Groups within Mn12 Clusters in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water&#8208;soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,5DHMn  12  &#8221;) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,4,5THMn  12  &#8221;) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one &#8211;OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate&#8208;Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water&#8208;soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,5DHMn  12  &#8221;) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,4,5THMn  12  &#8221;) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one &#8211;OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate&#8208;Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8208;hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#956;molg  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi&#8208;Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near&#8208;IR probe to unveil a rapid excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer&#8594;charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization and Coordination Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4).

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2&#8208; Hybrid Materials and Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core&#8208;shell hybrid materials based on a TiO  2  core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;  graft  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  ). The PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO  2  core. This resulted in high visible light&#8208;driven H  2  generation. The enhanced light&#8208;driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core&#8208;shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  was possible by introducing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  cluster anions as hydrogen evolution&#8208;cocatalyst. This novel design approach is one example for a multi&#8208;component system where reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the results from previous high&#8208;pressure experiments on the gadolinite&#8208;type mineral datolite,&#160;CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates &#946;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;and &#946;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;have been studied by synchrotron&#8208;based in situ high&#8208;pressure single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120 GPa, both borate layer&#8208;structures are preserved. Additionally, at ~114&#160;GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high&#8208;pressure modification&#160;&#947;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;features a rearrangement of the corner&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings. The new phase&#160;&#947;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;contains ten&#8208;membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra with exceptionally short B&#8211;O and B&#183;&#183;&#183;B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low&#8208;energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of crystal structures of SF  5  &#8208; or SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F&#183;&#183;&#183;H over F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts are below 95% of the van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF  5  groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules, the study focused on SF  4  Cl compounds, including the first solid&#8208;state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph&#8208;SF  5  derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F&#183;&#183;&#183;X contact formation (X = F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph&#8208;SF  5  , which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host&#8208;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N&#8208;rich antennae investigated in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green light emitting NDI is yet to be established. Herein we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric &#8211;NH2 substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8208;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8211;NH2 substituted NDI (2) revealed quantum yield, &#1060;f of ~81% and ~68% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the &#1060;f by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the ESIPT process. Our synthetic protocol applies Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8211;NH2 group integration at NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonds in excited&#8208;state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as emerging fluorinated groups: synthesis under photoredox catalysis and determination of the lipophilicity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico&#8208;chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive &#945;&#8208;Desulfonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from&#160;&#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated&#160;&#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the&#160;&#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones too.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from&#160;&#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated&#160;&#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the&#160;&#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones too. In addition, a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst&#8208;dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C&#8208;S cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Au  2  Fe, Ag  2  Fe and Cu  2  Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ], [Ag{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8242; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8242; in [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147  o  . The Fe(CO)  5  ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  . The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8242; fragments and  D  2  symmetry for the copper and silver cations and  D  4  d  symmetry for the gold cation.&#160; The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)  5  ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  show the order M = Au (  D  e  = 137.2 kcal/mol) &gt; Cu (  D  e  = 109.0 kcal/mol) &gt; Ag (  D  e  = 92.4 kcal/mol). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8208;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)  5  ]&#8594;M  +  &#8592;[Fe(CO)  5  ] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)  5  ]&#8592;M  +  &#8594;[Fe(CO)  5  ] backdonation.</dc:description>

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8208;carbenium interaction present in these complexes.&#160; Here, we show that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9&#8208; N &#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au &#8211; Acr distance.&#160; Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O &#8211; carbenium interaction.&#160; These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.&#160; These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Metal&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a&#160;  meta  &#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2&#8217;&#8208;position. Usually, a 120&#176; bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and&#160;  1  H,&#160;  13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen&#8208;bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a Re(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system we explore is a&#160;  fac  &#8208; [ Re(CO)  3  (TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl ] &#160;complexe, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ = 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[  i  ]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;  c  ]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirm the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived&#160;  3  MLCT state is observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remains as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8208;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  &#8208;H and C  sp3  &#8208;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  &#8208;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  &#8208;Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  &#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis &#8208;[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As).

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro&#173;chemical reactions that involve the production of OH &#8208; and the con&#173;sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re&#173;duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro&#173;gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activi&#173;ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt&#8208;nano&#173;sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#173;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular  pcu  &#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer MOFs [Zn  2  (dicarboxylate)  2  (NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8729;  x  DMF&#8729;  y  H  2  O, where dicarboxylate  =  1,4&#8208;bdc (  1  ), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (  2  ), NH  2  &#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (  3  ), 2,6&#8208;ndc (  4  ), and bpdc (  5  ), have been engineering tailored. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  feature two&#8208;fold degree of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1%, respectively. N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1&#8242;  &#8210;  5&#8242;  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. While  1&#8242;  and  3  &#8242;  &#8722;  5&#8242;  exhibited type I adsorption isotherms of CO  2  at 195 K,  2&#8242;  showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO  2  . Further,  3  &#8242;  also showed significant influence of amine functions in CO  2  uptake at high temperature due to the CO  2  &#8722;framework interactions. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  &#956;  M, respectively, and the Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 &#215; 10  3  , 1.79 &#215; 10  3  , 3.78 &#215; 10  3  , 4.04 &#215; 10  3  , and 3.21 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8722;1  , respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@  3  , has provided direct evidences to ensure the binding sites, which show strong host&#8210;guest &#960;&#8210;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions for benefiting donor&#8211;acceptor electron&#8208;transfer to result in fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance, since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia,  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry.

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (pXRD), UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co&#8208;catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values.

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>
