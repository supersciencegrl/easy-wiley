         <title>Carbazole&#8208; and Fluorene&#8208;fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs: NIR Fluorophores with High Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties were prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (  TPAB  ): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700 cm  &#8208;1  ) and emission maximum (up to 2270 cm  &#8208;1  ); almost 3&#8208;fold increase of molar absorption coefficients (to around 230,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and significant increase of the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8208;66%. Owing to the combination of these properties the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit is also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100 nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on  TPAB  chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Propensity of different Fluorine Atom Types: An Analysis of Experimentally&#8208; and Computationally&#8208;derived Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions. Over the last few years new and stronger evidences have emerged for the direct involvement of fluorine in weak hydrogen bond (HB) formation. However, not all the fluorine atom types can act as weak HBA. In this work we have analyzed the differential HBA propensity of various types of fluorine atoms with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. This is carried out by evaluating  ab initio  computed parameters, experimental  19  F NMR chemical shifts and small molecule crystallographic structures (extracted from the CSD database). According to this analysis, shielded (with reference to the  19  F NMR chemical shift) mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl motifs display the highest HBA propensity in agreement with solution studies. Although much weaker than other well characterized HB complexes, the fragile HBs formed by these fluorinated motifs have important implications for the chemical&#8208;physical and structural properties of the molecules, chemical reactions and protein/ligand recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Metallodrugs as Chemotherapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates for patients, with chemotherapy still the gold standard for treatment. This review collects information on all metallodrugs studied in TNBC cells and tumors, focusing on mechanistic and in vivo studies. An outlook towards TNBC metallodrugs with translational potential is provided.







Abstract
This review focuses on studies of coordination and organometallic compounds as potential chemotherapeutics against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates from all breast cancer types. At present, chemotherapy is still the standard of care for TNBC since only one type of targeted therapy has been recently developed. References for metal&#8208;based compounds studied in TNBC cell lines will be listed, and those of metal&#8208;specific reviews, but a detailed overview will also be provided on compounds studied in&#8197;vivo (mostly in mice models) and those compounds for which some preliminary mechanistic data was obtained (in TNBC cell lines and tumors) and/or for which bioactive ligands have been used. The main goal of this review is to highlight the most promising metal&#8208;based compounds with potential as chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC.

         <title>Scaling Up DNA Origami Lattice Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted assembly of DNA origami lattices is a promising technique for fabricating functional surfaces. Here, the formation of a homogeneous DNA origami lattice on mica over a total surface area of 18.75 cm2 is demonstrated. Atomic force and fluorescence microscopy mapping reveal the high uniformity and homogeneity of the lattice over almost the entire surface area. The total DNA costs amount to &#8364;0.12 per cm2.







Abstract
The surface&#8208;assisted hierarchical assembly of DNA origami nanostructures is a promising route to fabricate regular nanoscale lattices. In this work, the scalability of this approach is explored and the formation of a homogeneous polycrystalline DNA origami lattice at the mica&#8208;electrolyte interface over a total surface area of 18.75&#8197;cm2 is demonstrated. The topological analysis of more than 50 individual AFM images recorded at random locations over the sample surface showed only minuscule and random variations in the quality and order of the assembled lattice. The analysis of more than 450 fluorescence microscopy images of a quantum dot&#8208;decorated DNA origami lattice further revealed a very homogeneous surface coverage over cm2 areas with only minor boundary effects at the substrate edges. At total DNA costs of &#8364;&#8197;0.12 per cm2, this large&#8208;scale nanopatterning technique holds great promise for the fabrication of functional surfaces.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and an&#160;in situ&#160;irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Au&#8208;catalyzed Enynamide&#8208;Yne Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allows for an efficient access to a variety of  N  &#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8208;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In the present article, we report our complete experimental and computational investigations on the mechanism of such a transformation. Support for a dual gold catalysis has been found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety.

A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8208;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In the present article, we report our complete experimental and computational investigations on the mechanism of such a transformation. Support for a dual gold catalysis has been found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in 3 stages: 1) formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2) cyclization to produce a  gem  &#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3) catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This transformation relied on the the possible electrochemical oxidation of an&#160;  in situ  &#160;formed borate. This anodic oxidation performed in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a putative boryl radical, which reacted on the alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Withaferin A Inspired Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and functional properties of withaferin A suggested the design of a new candidate for Hedgehog pathway inhibitions. The enantioselective synthesis permitted the identification of two promising hits.







Abstract
Withanolides constitute a well&#8208;known family of plant&#8208;based alkaloids characterised by widespread biological properties, including the ability of interfering with Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. Following our interest in natural products and in anticancer compounds, we report here the synthesis of a new class of Hh signalling pathway inhibitors, inspired by withaferin A, the first isolated member of withanolides. The decoration of our scaffolds was rationally supported by in silico studies, while functional evaluation revealed promising candidates, confirming once again the importance of natural products as inspiration source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. A stereoselective approach, based on Brown chemistry, allowed the obtainment and the functional evaluation of the enantiopure hit compounds.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have been seldom explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc  2  , the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.</dc:description>

Direct C&#8722;N atroposelectivity: Recent studies have demonstrated that a preexisting C&#8722;N bond is not necessary for the direct enantioselective construction of valuable scaffolds comprising a rotationally hindered aromatic C&#8722;N bond.







Abstract
The atroposelective formation of C&#8722;N bonds has recently emerged within the field of amination reactions. On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class of organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8722;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.

PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 25, Page 7239-7251, May 3, 2021. </description>

The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ce L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; edge XAS spectra of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cerocene [Ce(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 4f&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; from Ce L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; by calculations, is stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 25, Page 7300-7306, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Accessing Lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;Lanthanide Energy Transfer in a Family of Site&#8208;Resolved [LnIIILnIII&#8242;] Heterodimetallic Complexes</title>

Lanthanides: A new method to prepare a large number of different heterometallic [LnLn&#8242;] dinuclear complexes is exploited for unique visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and NIR&#8208;to&#8208;NIR energy transfer (ET) within molecules, by using the [EuYb] and [NdYb] analogues, respectively. This demonstrates intramolecular sensitisation of Yb3+ by Nd3+, which acts as an ET donor.







Abstract
The ligand H3L (6&#8208;[3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propionyl]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), which exhibits two different coordination pockets, has been exploited to engender and study energy transfer (ET) in two dinuclear [LnIIILnIII&#8242;] analogues of interest, [EuYb] and [NdYb]. Their structural and physical properties have been compared with newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu], and [GdYb]) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, which have been previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between EuIII and YbIII does not occur to a significant extent, whereas emission from YbIII originates from sensitisation of the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two NdIII centres in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], in which YbIII luminescence is thus, in part, sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 25, Page 7275-7282, May 3, 2021. </description>

Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

Introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. For more information, see the Review by Z. Nairoukh et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;7193&#8197;ff.

The puzzling two&#8208;peaked X&#8208;ray absorption structure at the Ce L3 edge provides a wealth of information about the electronic structure of Ce complexes, such as the Ce 4f occupation and oxidation state and the extent of metal&#8208;ligand covalency. Multiconfigurational wavefunction calculations of the Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2, reveal the identity of the two&#8208;peaked edge structures and connection with the configurational admixture of the spectroscopically probed electronic states. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8208;C. Sergentu, C.&#8197;H. Booth, and J. Autschbach. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100145).

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Liu, Q.&#8208;X. Tong, et&#8197;al. on page 7275.

B12&#8208;derived phenyl&#8208;corrins are antivitamins B12 that resist the enzymatic cleavage of their Co&#8722;C bond. Surprisingly, as shown by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID, the Co&#8722;Csp2 bonds of phenyl&#8208;corrins are weaker than Co&#8722;Csp3 bonds of analogous methyl&#8208;corrins, contrasting the known effect of the hybridization on bond strengths. Hence, for the behavior of phenyl&#8208;cobalamins as antivitamins B12, stereo&#8208;electronic restrictions of the nucleophilic displacement are more critical than Co&#8722;C bond strengths. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Kr&#228;utler, P. Chen, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004589).

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 25, Page 7214-7230, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noncontact temperature sensors&lt;/b&gt; are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required.

Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Reactions on a 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Moiety of a Fullerene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 25, Page 7235-7238, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

         <title>Iridoid Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in Aphids Mimics Iridoid&#8208;Producing Plants</title>

Natural product biosynthesis in animals: Chemical synthesis of isotopically&#8208;labelled molecular probes and topical application using female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, are deployed along with coupled GC&#8208;mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) to show that biosynthesis of the female&#8208;produced aphid sex pheromone components (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) may follow a broadly similar route to that characterized for plants.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) in plants involves iridoid synthase (ISY), an atypical reductive cyclase that catalyses the reduction of 8&#8208;oxogeranial into the reactive enol of (S)&#8208;8&#8208;oxocitronellal, and cyclization of this enol intermediate, either non&#8208;enzymatically or by a nepetalactol&#8208;related short chain dehydrogenase enzyme (NEPS) that yields the nepetalactols. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis in&#8197;vivo of 1 and 2 in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of 2H4&#8722;lactol 1 and 2H4&#8722;lactone 2. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (S)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 25, Page 7188-7188, May 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Many studies on cerium compounds relate back to CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 when it comes to assigning the metal oxidation state and other ground&#8208;state wavefunction characteristics. It was therefore very important to establish, from first principles, how the ground states and the core&#8208;excited states in the different peaks exactly relate to each other. The Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 have never been calculated without prior assumptions about the excited states or within an ab initio formalism that considers explicitly the differential wavefunction relaxation of the ground&#8208;states and the core&#8208;excited states. We decided to take this task upon us.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;7239&#8197;ff.

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Prof. Jochen Autschbach and Dr. Dumitru&#8208;Claudiu Sergentu of State University of New York at Buffalo, and Dr. Corwin H. Booth of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The image depicts high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray beams as lightnings probing Ce at the L3 edge in the iconic covalent&#8208;bonded Ce(C8H8)2 and in CeO2. The mountain peaks in the background represent the double&#8208;peaked L3 edges. The peaks turn out to be intuitively interpreted in terms of localized orbitals and hence metal oxidation states.

     alt="Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;Many studies on cerium compounds relate back to CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ce(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when it comes to assigning the metal oxidation state and other ground&#8208;state wavefunction characteristics. It was therefore very important to establish, from first principles, how the ground states and the core&#8208;excited states in the different peaks exactly relate to each other. The Ce L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; edges in CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ce(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have never been calculated without prior assumptions about the excited states or within an ab initio formalism that considers explicitly the differential wavefunction relaxation of the ground&#8208;states and the core&#8208;excited states. We decided to take this task upon us&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;7239&#8197;ff.

Booth of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The image depicts high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray beams as lightnings probing Ce at the L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; edge in the iconic covalent&#8208;bonded Ce(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and in CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The mountain peaks in the background represent the double&#8208;peaked L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; edges. The peaks turn out to be intuitively interpreted in terms of localized orbitals and hence metal oxidation states.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of an o&#8208;Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted Three&#8208;Coordinate Borane Radical Anion</title>

Stabilization via three&#8208;coordinate boron allows the isolation of a paramagnetic radical anion of ortho&#8208;carborane. A photophysical, electrochemical and crystallographic study backed by DFT calculations shines light on closo&#8208;nido intermediate structures, charge transfer processes and electron accepting ability.







Abstract
Bis(1&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;carboran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;(4&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;borane [(1&#8208;(4&#8208;MeC6H4)&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10&#8208;2&#8208;)2(4&#8208;MeC6H4)B] (1), a new bis(o&#8208;carboranyl)&#8208;(R)&#8208;borane was synthesised by lithiation of the o&#8208;carboranyl precursor and subsequent salt metathesis reaction with (4&#8208;tolyl)BBr2. Cyclic voltammetry experiments on 1 show multiple distinct reduction events with a one&#8208;electron first reduction. In a selective reduction experiment the corresponding paramagnetic radical anion 1.&#8722; was isolated and characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analyses allow an in&#8208;depth comparison of 1, 1.&#8722;, their calculated geometries, and the S1 excited state of 1. Photophysical studies of 1 show a charge transfer (CT) emission with low quantum yield in solution but a strong increase in the solid state. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to identify transition&#8208;relevant orbitals.

         <title>d/f&#8208;Polypnictides Derived by Non&#8208;Classical Ln2+ Compounds: Synthesis, Small Molecule Activation and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As), were obtained by usage of non&#8208;classical divalent lanthanide compounds as reducing agents. While their optical properties were investigated by fs&#8208;spectroscopy, their reactivity was studied by P4 activation. The latter resulted in a selective expansion of the P5 rings ([K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd)).







Abstract
Reduction chemistry induced by divalent lanthanides has been primarily focused on samarium so far. In light of the rich physical properties of the lanthanides, this limitation to one element is a drawback. Since molecular divalent compounds of almost all lanthanides have been available for some time, we used one known and two new non&#8208;classical reducing agents of the early lanthanides to establish a sophisticated reduction chemistry. As a result, six new d/f&#8208;polyphosphides or d/f&#8208;polyarsenides, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(E5)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd; E=P, As) were obtained. Their reactivity was studied by activation of P4, resulting in a selective expansion of the P5 rings. The obtained compounds [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Ln(P7)FeCp*] (Ln=La, Nd) are the first examples of an activation of P4 by a f&#8208;element&#8208;polypnictide complex. Additionally, the first systematic femtosecond (fs)&#8208;spectroscopy investigations of d/f&#8208;polypnictides are presented to showcase the advantages of having access to a broader series of lanthanide compounds.

         <title>A Novel M8L6 Cubic Cage That Binds Tetrapyridyl Porphyrins: Cage and Solvent Effects in Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and application of a novel caged cobalt porphyrin catalyst is reported. The effects of the solvent and/or the cage on the catalytic performance in cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions were investigated for the free and confined catalyst. Encapsulation of the catalyst led to a three times more active catalyst compared to the well&#8208;established cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin and leads to a substantially increased TON.







Abstract
Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post&#8208;functionalization. This is a rare example of a metal&#8208;coordination cage able to bind catalytically active porphyrins that is soluble in solvents spanning a wide variety of polarity. This system was used to investigate the combined effects of the solvent and the cage on the catalytic performance in the cobalt catalyzed cyclopropanation of styrene, which involves radical intermediates. Kinetic studies show that DMF has a protective influence on the catalyst, slowing down deactivation of both [Co(TPP)] and Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, leading to higher TONs in this solvent. Moreover, DFT studies on the [Co(TPP)] catalyst show that the rate determining energy barrier of this radical&#8208;type transformation is not influenced by the coordination of DMF. As such, the increased TONs obtained experimentally stem from the stabilizing effect of DMF and are not due to an intrinsic higher activity caused by axial ligand binding to the cobalt center ([Co(TPP)(L)]). Remarkably, encapsulation of Co&#8722;G led to a three times more active catalyst than [Co(TPP)] (TOFini) and a substantially increased TON compared to both [Co(TPP)] and free Co&#8722;G. The increased local concentration of the substrates in the hydrophobic cage compared to the bulk explains the observed higher catalytic activities.

         <title>Reductive Rearrangement of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>

1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornenes (PAN) are shown to be suitable starting materials for novel bridged 7&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles (using lithium aluminium hydride as reducing agent) or lithium phospholide (with elemental lithium as reducing agent). Artwork by Dr. Christoph Selg.







Abstract
The reduction of the 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene derivate endo&#8208;1 with lithium aluminium hydride leads to an unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene, while a phospholide anion is formed with lithium. The latter can be protonated resulting in formation of an unusual 2H&#8208;phosphole dimer. Furthermore, 3H&#8208;phospholes, previously assumed to have no synthetic relevance as intermediates, were proposed to act as dienophile in the dimerisation of 3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylphosphole at elevated temperatures based on theoretical calculations.

         <dc:description>Owing to their highly designable and tunable features, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively investigated and developed in a wide range of applications. However, due to their crystalline nature, poor manipulation and processability restrict their practical implementation. In this context, the development of membranous MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid materials is an effective approach to address these shortcomings. This minireview provides a systematic overview on the construction of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and emphasizes their functions, including separation, ion conduction, and sensing, and points out a perspective on their future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8208;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behavior between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2, 3) (Cp = 1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L = 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy,  1[PF6]n), 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5'&#8208;dmbpy,  2[PF6]n) and 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4'&#8208;dmbpy,  3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized.&#160;The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru center from H, 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order:  13+  &lt;  23+  &lt;  33+  , and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order  14+  &gt;  34+  &gt;  24+  . The &#160;potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centers for  N[PF6]2  are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centers would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF  4  ] involving heteroanionic units. Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs  3  (B  3  O  3  F  6  )&#183;Cs(BF  4  ). The influence of [BF  4  ] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF  4  ] units.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;  &#160;  = 100%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, we developed various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, we studied the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired and Eco&#8208;friendly Synthesis of 3D Spongy Meso&#8208;Microporous Carbons from CO2 for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO  2  in molten carbonate Li  2  CO  3  &#8208;Na  2  CO  3  &#8208;K  2  CO  3  at 580&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO  2  at 4 A for 0.5 h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  , excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9 % of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for  L  &#8208;cysteine (  L  &#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co  3  O  4  composite (NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  ) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co  3  O  4  , NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co  3  O  4  and multi&#8208;electron NiMo  6  clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo  6  , and the optimized NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive  L  &#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023 &#956;M  &#8208;1  and the detection limit at least 0.018 &#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8722;20 &#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Nanosheets Stacked Hierarchical &#8220;Honey Stick&#8208;like&#8221; MFI Zeolite by Aromatic Heterocyclic Dual&#8208;functional Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft template designing is the most promised strategy for synthesis of zeolites nanosheets. So far, MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component), can be found frequently. However, the MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft template with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.g. s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, nanosheets stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized utilizing a triply branched s&#8208;triazine based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM was endowed with abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430 m  2  &#8236;&#183;g  &#8208;1  ). The 1 wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture yield (from 66% to 85%) in oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Bright GFP&#8208;Like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Here, we report a novel fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of ~100,000 M  &#8722;1  &#183;cm  &#8722;1  . Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8208;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Functionalized Derivatives of the Virulence&#8208;Associated Sugar Pseudaminic Acid: Chiral Pool Synthesis and Labeling of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made derivatives of pseudaminic acid (Pse) allow for the detection of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid. The synthesis of azido&#8208;labeled Pse derivatives starting from d&#8208;glucose and respective labeling studies are described.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is a significant prokaryotic monosaccharide found in important Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This unique sugar serves as a component of cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated glycans or glycoproteins and is associated with their virulence. We report the synthesis of azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse derivatives as part of a search for Pse&#8208;derived metabolic labeling reagents. The synthesis was initiated with d&#8208;glucose (Glc), which served as a cost&#8208;effective chiral pool starting material. Key synthetic steps involve the conversion of C1 of Glc into the terminal methyl group of Pse, and inverting deoxyaminations at C3 and C5 of Glc followed by backbone elongation with a three&#8208;carbon unit using the Barbier reaction. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that, of the four Pse derivatives, ester&#8208;protected C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;Pse successfully labeled cells of Pse&#8208;expressing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains. No labeling was observed in cells of non&#8208;Pse&#8208;expressing strains. The ester&#8208;protected and C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse is thus a useful reagent for the identification of bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid.

Key synthetic steps involve the conversion of C1 of Glc into the terminal methyl group of Pse, and inverting deoxyaminations at C3 and C5 of Glc followed by backbone elongation with a three&#8208;carbon unit using the Barbier reaction. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that, of the four Pse derivatives, ester&#8208;protected C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;Pse successfully labeled cells of Pse&#8208;expressing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains. No labeling was observed in cells of non&#8208;Pse&#8208;expressing strains. The ester&#8208;protected and C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse is thus a useful reagent for the identification of bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoinduced Electron vs. Concerted Proton Electron Transfer Pathways in SnIV (l&#8208;Tryptophanato)2 Porphyrin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) occur in tin(IV) porphyrin&#8208;tryptophan conjugates in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state which point out how peculiar the l&#8208;tryptophan amino acid is with respect to charge transfer reactions.







Abstract
Aromatic amino acids such as l&#8208;tyrosine and l&#8208;tryptophan are deployed in natural systems to mediate electron transfer (ET) reactions. While tyrosine oxidation is always coupled to deprotonation (proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer, PCET), both ET&#8208;only and PCET pathways can occur in the case of the tryptophan residue. In the present work, two novel conjugates 1 and 2, based on a SnIV tetraphenylporphyrin and SnIV octaethylporphyrin, respectively, as the chromophore/electron acceptor and l&#8208;tryptophan as electron/proton donor, have been prepared and thoroughly characterized by a combination of different techniques including single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The photophysical investigation of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 in the presence of pyrrolidine as a base shows that different quenching mechanisms are operating upon visible&#8208;light excitation of the porphyrin component, namely photoinduced electron transfer and concerted proton electron transfer (CPET), depending on the chromophore identity and spin multiplicity of the excited state. The results are compared with those previously described for metal&#8208;mediated analogues featuring SnIV porphyrin chromophores and l&#8208;tyrosine as the redox active amino acid and well illustrate the peculiar role of l&#8208;tryptophan with respect to PCET.

         <title>Imide Condensation as a Strategy for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Diversified G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands with Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activity**
</title>

The rigid rules of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization: A library of amphiphiles has been synthesized in one step, using a simple imide condensation reaction. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization, anti&#8208;cancer and anti&#8208;parasitic activity of the library has been investigated, uncovering the important factors that govern G&#8208;quadruplex binding and selectivity, yielding a promising new core&#8208;motif and a compound with potent trypanosomacidal activity.







Abstract
A facile imide coupling strategy for the one&#8208;step preparation of G&#8208;quadruplex ligands with varied core chemistries is described. The G&#8208;quadruplex stabilization of a library of nine compounds was examined using FRET melting experiments, and CD, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and NMR titrations, identifying several compounds that were capable of stabilizing G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with interesting selectivity profiles. The best G4 ligand was identified as compound 3, which was based on a perylene scaffold and exhibited 40&#8208;fold selectivity for a telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex over duplex DNA. Surprisingly, a tetra&#8208;substituted flexible core, compound 11, also exhibited selective stabilization of G4 DNA over duplex DNA. The anticancer and antiparasitic activity of the library was also examined, with the lead compound 3 exhibiting nanomolar inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei with 78&#8208;fold selectivity over MRC5 cells. The cellular localization of this compound was also studied via fluorescence microscopy. We found that uptake was time dependant, with localization outside the nucleus and kinetoplast that could be due to strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of small amounts of DNA.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Factors of ortho&#8208;Benzyne Formation in Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (HDDA) Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights the mechanism of ortho&#8208;aryne formation via hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, based on quantum chemical calculations, as well as kinetic, preparative and ultrafast spectroscopic experiments. The influence of the steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of substituents attached to diyne/diynophile pairs and linked yne&#8208;diynes provide crucial insight into the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
With the rapid development of the hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (HDDA) from its first discovery in 1997, the question of whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism better describes the thermally activated formation of ortho&#8208;benzyne from a diyne and a diynophile has been debated. Mechanistic and kinetic investigations were able to show that this is not a black or white situation, as minor changes can tip the balance. For that reason, especially, linked yne&#8208;diynes were studied to examine steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of their terminal substituents on the reaction mechanism and kinetics. Furthermore, the influence of the nature of the linker on the HDDA reaction was explored. The more recently discovered photochemical HDDA reaction also gives ortho&#8208;arynes, which display the same reactivity as the thermally generated ones, but their formation might not proceed by the same mechanism. This minireview summarizes the current state of mechanistic understanding of the HDDA reaction.

         <title>A Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Salvinorin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divine sage: The potent KOR agonist (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only sixteen steps by modification of our previous route to the racemic title compound. Transition to asymmetric synthesis succeeded by a highly enantioselective propargylation to install the stereogenic center at C&#8208;12. Shortening of the original reaction sequence by two steps was finally achieved using a chemoselective Mitsunobu esterification of a cyclic syn 1,2&#8208;diol. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.







Abstract
A concise enantioselective total synthesis of the neoclerodane diterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A is reported. The stereogenic center at C&#8208;12 was installed by catalytic asymmetric propargylation with excellent enantioselectivity, and the remaining six stereogenic centers were set up highly diastereoselectively under substrate control. As for our previous synthesis of racemic salvinorin A, two intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions were applied to generate the tricyclic core. A chemoselective Mitsunobu inversion of a syn 1,2&#8208;diol allowed for further streamlining of the original reaction sequence by two steps. Overall, (&#8722;)&#8208;salvinorin A was synthesized in only 16 steps starting from 3&#8208;furaldehyde with 1.4&#8201;% total yield. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder strategy employing a 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene moiety was investigated.

         <title>Paramagnetic Solid&#8208;State NMR to Localize the Metal&#8208;Ion Cofactor in an Oligomeric DnaB Helicase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR enables the positioning of the metal&#8208;ion co&#8208;factor in the ATP&#8208;fueled bacterial helicase DnaB from Helicobacter pylori. Diamagnetic Mg2+ is exchanged by paramagnetic Mn2+ and Co2+ leading to paramagnetic relaxation enhancements and pseudo&#8208;contact shifts in the NMR spectra. The Co2+ pseudo&#8208;contact shift surface reveals insights into DNA binding.







Abstract
Paramagnetic metal ions can be inserted into ATP&#8208;fueled motor proteins by exchanging the diamagnetic Mg2+ cofactor with Mn2+ or Co2+. Then, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) or pseudo&#8208;contact shifts (PCSs) can be measured to report on the localization of the metal ion within the protein. We determine the metal position in the oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with the transition&#8208;state ATP&#8208;analogue ADP:AlF4&#8722; and single&#8208;stranded DNA using solid&#8208;state NMR and a structure&#8208;calculation protocol employing CYANA. We discuss and compare the use of Mn2+ and Co2+ in localizing the ATP cofactor in large oligomeric protein assemblies. 31P PCSs induced in the Co2+&#8208;containing sample are then used to localize the DNA phosphate groups on the Co2+ PCS tensor surface enabling structural insights into DNA binding to the DnaB helicase.

         <title>Excited State Properties of Lanthanide(III) Complexes with a Nonadentate Bispidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of a nonadentate bispidine derivative were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand, and the identical emission spectra in the solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields, making these complexes a possible basis for interesting biological probes.







Abstract
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of the nonadentate bispidine derivative L2 (bispidine=3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand L2 that enforces to all LnIII cations a common highly symmetrical capped square antiprismatic (CSAPR) coordination geometry (pseudo C4v symmetry). The well&#8208;resolved identical emission spectra in solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields ([EuIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.51&#8197;ms, &#966;=0.35; [TbIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.95&#8197;ms, &#966;=0.68). Together with the very high kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities, these complexes are a possible basis for interesting biological probes.

A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 is presented. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized and isolated. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as universal building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.







Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 was developed. Based on sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalizations, chiral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized via stepwise cyclopropanation of C60 with suitable macrocyclic tri&#8208; and bifunctional cyclomalonate tethers. The four resulting stereoisomers were isolated using chiral HPLC. The corresponding pairs of enantiomers show mirror image behavior in their CD&#8208;spectra. The pentakis&#8208;adducts served as suitable building blocks for the spatially controlled synthesis of mixed hexakis&#8208;adducts. Implementation of functional group&#8208;bearing monomalonates afforded octahedral [3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1] hexakis&#8208;adducts suitable for the construction of larger molecular and supramolecular fullerene architectures in excellent yield.

         <title>Cationic Aluminium Complexes as Catalysts for Imine Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#175; salts. Their catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation depends strongly on the substituents in the BDI ligand. DFT calculations on the mechanism reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles. Hydrogen is activated either by Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine or Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pairs.







Abstract
Strongly Lewis acidic cationic aluminium complexes, stabilized by &#946;&#8211;diketiminate (BDI) ligands and free of Lewis bases, have been prepared as their B(C6F5)4&#8722; salts and were investigated for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. The backbone (R1) and N (R2) substituents on the R1,R2BDI ligand (R1,R2BDI=HC[C(R1)N(R2)]2) influence sterics and Lewis acidity. Ligand bulk increases along the row Me,DIPPBDI&lt;Me,DIPePBDI&#8776;tBu,DIPPBDI&lt;tBu,DIPePBDI; DIPP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Me2&#8208;phenyl, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;C(H)Et2&#8208;phenyl. The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test showed acceptor numbers of: (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 85.6, (tBu,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 85.9, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ 89.7, (Me,DIPePBDI)AlMe+ 90.8, (Me,DIPPBDI)AlH+ 95.3. Steric and electronic factors need to be balanced for catalytic activity in imine hydrogenation. Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (tBu,DIPPBDI)AlMe+ shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalysed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine cycle is energetically favoured.

Open, highly Lewis acidic, cations strongly coordinate imine rendering it inactive as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP). The bulkiest cations do not coordinate imine but its combination is also not an active catalyst. The cation (&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu,DIPP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)AlMe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shows the best catalytic activity for various imines and is also an active catalyst for the Tishchenko reaction of benzaldehyde to benzylbenzoate. DFT calculations on the mechanism of imine hydrogenation catalysed by cationic Al complexes reveal two interconnected catalytic cycles operating in concert. Hydrogen is activated either by FLP reactivity of an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;imine couple or, after formation of significant quantities of amine, by reaction with an Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine couple. The latter autocatalytic Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amine cycle is energetically favoured.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polythiolactone&#8208;Decorated Silica Particles: A Versatile Approach for Surface Functionalization, Catalysis and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer&#8208;decorated precursor particles: Silica particles functionalized with polythiolactone polymer brushes are precursor particles for molecular surface functionalization, nanoparticle assemblies for catalysis, and polymer capsules for payload delivery applications.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of colloidal silica has tremendous effects on its properties and applications. Commonly the design of silica particles is based on their de novo synthesis followed by surface functionalization leading to tailormade properties for a specific purpose. Here, the design of robust &#8220;precursor&#8221; polymer&#8208;decorated silica nano&#8208; and microparticles is demonstrated, which allows for easy post&#8208;modification by polymer embedded thiolactone chemistry. To obtain this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material, silica particles (SiO2P) were functionalized via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA)&#8208;poly(thiolactone acrylamide (PThlAm) co&#8208;polymer brushes. Exploiting the versatility of thiolactone post&#8208;modification, a system was developed that could be used in three exemplary applications: 1) the straightforward molecular post&#8208;functionalization to tune the surface polarity, and therefore the dispersibility in various solvents; 2) the immobilization of metal nanoparticles into the polymer brushes via the in&#8197;situ formation of free thiols that preserved catalytic activity in a model reaction; 3) the formation of redox&#8208;responsive, permeable polymer capsules by crosslinking the thiolactone moieties with cystamine dihydrochloride (CDH) followed by dissolution of the silica core.

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate CuII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a bulky carbazolyl substituent, heteroleptic dicoordinate copper complexes with CuII character were synthesised. Delocalisation of the spin density in the ligand scaffold as well as dispersion forces apparently play a role in the stabilisation of these compounds.







Abstract
In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate CuII complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (1). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X=monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO3Et (2), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf2)2] (3) and RCuNTf2 (4) could be isolated. Spectroscopic indications corroborate more CuI than CuII character in all RCuX derivatives.

         <title>Consequences of amide connectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrins: spectroscopic observations rationalized by theoretical modelling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between molecular structure and mechanism of supramolecular polymerizations is a topic of great interest, with a special focus on the pathway complexity of porphyrin assemblies. Their cooperative polymerization typically yields highly ordered, long 1D polymers and is driven by a combination of &#960;&#8208;stacking due to solvophobic effects and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subtle changes in molecular structure, however, have significant influence on the cooperativity factor and yield different aggregate types (J&#8208; versus H&#8208;aggregates) of different lengths. In this study we investigate the influence of amide connectivity on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of porphyrin based supramolecular monomers. While in apolar solvents C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling, we shed light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrate the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, we present their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert &#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert &#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.</dc:description>

The highly economic, insensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;  absorbance average  s  ulfur  a  mount in  p  olysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative  13  C NMR. Also, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and unsymmetrical polysulfides was obtained.</dc:description>

Nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene was realized by a very facile and highly efficient approach, which includes a first&#8208;step patterned fluorination with a very high degree of functionalization, realized by laser writing, and a subsequent nucleophilic substitution of the attached fluorine atoms with thiophene groups.







Abstract
A very facile and efficient protocol for the covalent patterning and properties tuning of graphene is reported.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nanoscale patterning&lt;/b&gt; and tailoring of graphene was realized by a very facile and highly efficient approach, which includes a first&#8208;step patterned fluorination with a very high degree of functionalization, realized by laser writing, and a subsequent nucleophilic substitution of the attached fluorine atoms with thiophene groups.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very facile and efficient protocol for the covalent patterning and properties tuning of graphene is reported. Highly reactive fluorine radicals were added to confined regions of graphene directed by laser writing on graphene coated with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylbenziodoxole. This process allows for the realization of exquisite patterns on graphene with resolutions down to 200&#8197;nm. The degree of functionalization, ranging from the unfunctionalized graphene to extremely high functionalized graphene, can be precisely tuned by controlling the laser irradiation time. Subsequent substitution of the initially patterned fluorine atoms afforded an unprecedented graphene nanostructure bearing thiophene groups. This substitution led to a complete switch of both the electronic structure and the polarization within the patterned graphene regions. This approach paves the way towards the precise modulation of the structure and properties of nanostructured graphene.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;Carboxydeoxycytidines as Oxidative Lesions and Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exact UHPLC&#8208;MS2 quantifications were used to determine the oxidative lesion and epigenetically induced levels of the non&#8208;canonical bases hmdC, fdC and cadC and of the levels of base excision repair intermediates.







Abstract
The four non&#8208;canonical nucleotides in the human genome 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;, 5&#8208;formyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;carboxydeoxycytidine (mdC, hmdC, fdC and cadC) form a second layer of epigenetic information that contributes to the regulation of gene expression. Formation of the oxidized nucleotides hmdC, fdC and cadC requires oxidation of mdC by ten&#8208;eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes that require oxygen, Fe(II) and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate as cosubstrates. Although these oxidized forms of mdC are widespread in mammalian genomes, experimental evidence for their presence in fungi and plants is ambiguous. This vagueness is caused by the fact that these oxidized mdC derivatives are also formed as oxidative lesions, resulting in unclear basal levels that are likely to have no epigenetic function. Here, we report the xdC levels in the fungus Amanita muscaria in comparison to murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), HEK cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to obtain information about the basal levels of hmdC, fdC and cadC as DNA lesions in the genome.

         <title>Tuning J&#8208;aggregate Formation and Emission Efficiency in Cationic Diazapentacenium Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new diazapentacenium salts have been obtained from a new synthetic methodology and shown to display a drastic increase of fluorescence quantum yields induced by aggregation (AIE phenomena) in poor solvents and associated to a particular type of aggregates organization: J&#8208;aggregates. A simple structural modification (4 H in D1 vs 4 F in D2) changes the contribution of J&#8208;aggregates which is quantitatively followed by time resolved fluorescence.







Abstract
Enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of two new diazapentacenium salts (D1 and D2) of more than 55 for D1 and 22 times for D2) in poor solvents, acetonitrile and/or dichloromethane, was observed and rationalized as formation of emissive J&#8208;aggregates. Both compounds displaying 4&#8208;n&#8208;decylphenyl substituents at the 7,14&#8208;carbons and phenyl (D1) or 2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl (D2) substituents at the quaternary nitrogen atoms in 5,12&#8208;positions have been synthetized in a two&#8208;step procedure involving a two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig&#8208;type CN cross&#8208;coupling and an electrophilic Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization. The optical properties of the dicationic diazapentacenium salts in various solvents and in thin films have been investigated by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. In thin films and in good solvents, isolated molecules coexist with aggregates. Nonetheless, D1 is seven times more emissive than D2, reflecting a higher J&#8208;aggregate contribution in the former.

         <title>The Mechanism of Cleavage of RNA Phosphodiesters by a Gold Nanoparticle Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;phosphodiesters are easily cleaved by gold nanozymes functionalized with Zn(II) ligands with a nucleophilic mechanism. The catalytic site requires two metal ions for catalysis and at least a third one for binding of the uridine nucleobase.







Abstract
The cleavage of uridine 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphodiesters bearing alcohols with pKa ranging from 7.14 to 14.5 catalyzed by AuNPs functionalized with 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Zn(II) complexes has been studied to unravel the source of catalysis by these nanosystems (nanozymes). The results have been compared with those obtained with two Zn(II) dinuclear catalysts for which the mechanism is fairly understood. Binding to the Zn(II) ions by the substrate and the uracil of uridine was observed. The latter leads to inhibition of the process and formation of less productive binding complexes than in the absence of the nucleobase. The nanozyme operates with these substrates mostly via a nucleophilic mechanism with little stabilization of the pentacoordinated phosphorane and moderate assistance in leaving group departure. This is attributed to a decrease of binding strength of the substrate to the catalytic site in reaching the transition state due to an unfavorable binding mode with the uracil. The nanozyme favors substrates with better leaving groups than the less acidic ones.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven gem Hydrogenation: An Orthogonal Entry into &#8220;Second&#8208;Generation&#8221; Ruthenium Carbene Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
On the spot: Light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation elicits the inherent vic&#8208;dicarbene character of a triple bond. This unusual reactivity mode can be harnessed in the form of a novel, safe, convenient and efficient approach to second&#8208;generation &#8220;Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8221;&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes for olefin metathesis that relies on the use of alkynes rather than diazoalkanes as the ultimate carbene sources.







Abstract
The newly discovered light&#8208;driven gem hydrogenation of alkynes opens an unconventional yet efficient entry into five&#8208;coordinate Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes with cis&#8208;disposed chloride ligands. Representatives of this class featuring a chelate substructure formed by an iodo&#8208;substituted benzylidene unit react with (substituted) 2&#8208;isopropoxystyrene to give prototypical &#8220;second&#8208;generation&#8221; Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda complexes for olefin metathesis. The new approach to this venerable catalyst family is safe and versatile as it uses a triple bond rather than phenyldiazomethane as the ultimate carbene source and does not require any sacrificial phosphines.

         <title>Rerouting and Improving Dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol Synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae to a High Yielding Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Daucenol Synthase (DcS) from Streptomyces venezuelae was redirected using substrate analogues with additional, shifted, or lacking methyl groups to yield molecules from a naturally difficult to access chemical space, and improved in its catalytic efficiency through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of surface residues, turning DcS into a high yielding biocatalyst.







Abstract
The dauc&#8208;8&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae was investigated for its catalytic activity towards alternative terpene precursors, specifically designed to enable new cyclisation pathways. Exchange of aromatic amino acid residues at the enzyme surface by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis led to a 4&#8208;fold increase of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results from an increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of a Druggable Site on Virulence Factor of Drug Resistant Burkholderia cenocepacia**

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new druggable site for anti&#8208;adhesive therapy. We used fragment&#8208;based virtual screening to explore the druggability of a region in the vicinity of the fucose binding site in a lectin from an opportunistic and highly drug&#8208;resistant pathogen. The crystal structure of the target protein complexed with the lead fragment validated the existence of a secondary binding site, paving the way for the design of potent ligands to be employed in anti&#8208;adhesive therapy.







Abstract
Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic Gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes infections in patients suffering from chronic granulomatous diseases and cystic fibrosis. It displays significant morbidity and mortality due to extreme resistance to almost all clinically useful antibiotics. The bacterial lectin BC2L&#8208;C expressed in B. cenocepacia is an interesting drug target involved in bacterial adhesion and subsequent deadly infection to the host. We solved the first high resolution crystal structure of the apo form of the lectin N&#8208;terminal domain (BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt) and compared it with the ones complexed with carbohydrate ligands. Virtual screening of a small fragment library identified potential hits predicted to bind in the vicinity of the fucose binding site. A series of biophysical techniques and X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening were employed to validate the interaction of the hits with the protein domain. The X&#8208;ray structure of BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt complexed with one of the identified active fragments confirmed the ability of the site computationally identified to host drug&#8208;like fragments. The fragment affinity could be determined by titration microcalorimetry. These structure&#8208;based strategies further provide an opportunity to elaborate the fragments into high affinity anti&#8208;adhesive glycomimetics, as therapeutic agents against B. cenocepacia.

         <title>Fluorinated Azobenzenes Switchable with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular photoswitches find rapidly growing applications in biocompatible materials and photopharmacology. ortho&#8208;Fluorinated azobenzenes bearing conjugated sp2 substituents can be effectively photoisomerized with light wavelengths above 630&#8197;nm, within the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;, which enables deep penetration of soft human tissues. This observation may therefore facilitate the design of new&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive therapeutics.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches triggered with red or NIR light are optimal for photomodulation of complex biological systems, including efficient penetration of the human body for therapeutic purposes (&#8220;therapeutic window&#8221;). Yet, they are rarely reported, and even more rarely functional under aqueous conditions. In this work, fluorinated azobenzenes are shown to exhibit efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with red light (PSS660nm &gt;75&#8201;% Z) upon conjugation with unsaturated substituents. Initially demonstrated for aldehyde groups, this effect was also observed in a more complex structure by incorporating the chromophore into a cyclic dipeptide with propensity for self&#8208;assembly. Under physiological conditions, the latter molecule formed a supramolecular material that reversibly changed its viscosity upon irradiation with red light. Our observation can lead to design of new photopharmacology agents or phototriggered materials for in&#8197;vivo use.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Silicon Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revisiting the chemical bond on silylene&#8208;carbonyl species reveals a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction between the CO and the silylene. The bonding can be conventionally understood as a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Nonetheless, an unrecognized &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbital faithfully explains the relationship between structure and stability.







Abstract
Although silylene&#8208;carbonyl complexes are known for decades, only recently isolable examples have been accomplished. In this work, the bonding situation is re&#8208;evaluated to explain the origins of their remarkable stability within the Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory framework. It is shown that the chemical bond can be understood as CO interaction with the silylene via a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction: a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Notably, it was established that the driving force behind the surprisingly stable Si&#8722;CO compounds, however, is another &#960;&#8208;back donation from a perpendicular bonding R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Consequently, the pyramidalization of the central silicon atom cannot be associated with the strength of the &#960;&#8208;back donation, in sharp contrast to the established chemical bonding model. Considering this additional bonding interaction not only shed light on the bonding situation, but is also an indispensable key for broadening the scope of silylene&#8208;carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: Reactivity Trends across the Periodic Table</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic reactivity trends! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how various weakly interacting Lewis acids across the periodic table, based on hydrogen, pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds, accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate by amplifying the degree of asynchronicity and reducing the Pauli repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The catalytic effect of various weakly interacting Lewis acids (LAs) across the periodic table, based on hydrogen (Group&#8197;1), pnictogen (Group&#8197;15), chalcogen (Group&#8197;16), and halogen (Group&#8197;17) bonds, on the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate was studied quantum chemically by using relativistic density functional theory. Weakly interacting LAs accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen&lt;hydrogen&lt;chalcogen&lt;pnictogen&#8208;bonded LAs, i.&#8201;e., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering catalysis concept.

The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen&amp;lt;hydrogen&amp;lt;chalcogen&amp;lt;pnictogen&#8208;bonded LAs, &lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the &lt;i&gt;Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering catalysis&lt;/i&gt; concept.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of Bicarbonate Unravelled**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new assay to study bicarbonate transport is reported, which is based on a europium complex that is encapsulated inside liposomes and reports changes in the intravesicular concentration of bicarbonate in a direct and highly sensitive way. This assay was used to reveal that synthetic anion transporters can act via different mechanisms: 1) actual transport of HCO3&#8722; anions; 2) CO2 diffusion coupled to dissipation of the resulting transmembrane pH gradient.







Abstract
Anion receptors can be used to transport ions across lipid bilayers, which has potential for therapeutic applications. Synthetic bicarbonate transporters are of particular interest, as defects in transmembrane transport of bicarbonate are associated with various diseases. However, no convenient method exists to directly observe bicarbonate transport and study the mechanisms involved. Here, an assay is presented that allows the kinetics of bicarbonate transport into liposomes to be monitored directly and with great sensitivity. The assay utilises an encapsulated europium(III) complex, which exhibits a large increase in emission intensity upon binding bicarbonate. Mechanisms involving CO2 diffusion and the dissipation of a pH gradient are shown to be able to lead to an increase in bicarbonate concentration within liposomes, without transport of the anion occurring at all. By distinguishing these alternative mechanisms from actual bicarbonate transport, this assay will inform the future development of bicarbonate transporters.

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydrogenative C(sp2)&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Power'ful Aminations. A simple transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic amination strategy has been developed. The transformation takes place in the absence of any electrocatalyst by using cheap and easily available graphite electrodes. The reaction allows for the synthesis of carbazole derivatives via intramolecular C&#8722;H amination and also cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)arenes and various N&#8208;arylamides in an undivided cell set up. The usage of an acidic solvent was beneficial as it eliminated the requirement of additional supporting electrolytes for the electrolysis.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic C&#8722;H amination involving an electrochemically generated nitrenium ion intermediate has been developed. The electrosynthesis takes place in the absence of any organoiodine catalysts and is enabled by an in&#8197;situ generated electrolyte. A novel, efficient intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8722;H amination has been demonstrated using a simple reaction setup.

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs Different Bonding Pattern</title>

         <dc:description>In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr  2  . High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr  2  in comparison to prototypical MoSi  2  shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved using amines, difluorocarbene (generated  in situ  ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO  2  . Various  tert  &#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification using column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained via computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0 &#176;C without any additives was discovered. Furthermore, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.</dc:description>

         <title>An Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [N^C^N]Au(III) Pincer Complexes by Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [N^C^N]Au(III) complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer&#8208;complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only byproduct. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in case of a transmetallation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [N^C^N]Au(III) pincer&#8208;complex was synthesized by using this technology.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Hydride Shifts &#8211; What controls Guaiane Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic computational study addressing the entire chemical space of guaianes in conjunction with an analysis of all known compounds shows that 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts are rare events in guaiane biosynthesis. As demonstrated here, 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts towards guaianes can only be realized for two stereochemically well defined out of numerous possible stereoisomeric skeletons. One example is given by the mechanism of guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from California poplar, an enzyme that yields guaiane sesquiterpenes with unusual stereochemical properties. The generalizing results from DFT calculations were experimentally verified through isotopic labeling experiments with guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase.</dc:description>

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of traditional ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitizers with low&#8208;cost and abundant iron analogs is a key step for the advancement of scalable and sustainable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells. Herein this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we utilize a pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore to construct a cyanide&#8208;based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. The iron&#8208;sensitized photoanode exhibits exceptional stability for at least 5 hours at pH 7 and features its photosensitizing ability with an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion capacity up to 500 nm with nanosecond scale excited state lifetime. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other for charge separation via short bridging cyanide groups and for injection to the semiconductor in our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoelectrochemical device. The reorganization of the excited states due to the mixing of electronic states of metal&#8208;based orbitals subsequently tailor the electron transfer cascade during the photoelectrochemical process. This breakthrough in chromophore&#8208;catalyst assemblies will spark interest in dye&#8208;sensitization with robust bulk systems for photoconversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks toward Diverse Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs in photocatalytic oxidation of organics: Hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 offers a fascinating alternative photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of valuable small organics such as amines, ethers, thioethers and pyridinium salts. By means of its superior photocatalytic ability in molecular oxygen activation and inherent heterogenous nature, the present protocol exhibits impressive efficiency, selectivity and sustainability.







Abstract
Photoactive two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have become promising heterogenous photocatalysts in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformations. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven selective aerobic oxidation of various small organic molecules by using 2D&#8208;COFs as the photocatalyst was developed. In this protocol, due to the remarkable photocatalytic capability of hydrazone&#8208;based 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 on molecular oxygen activation, a wide range of amides, quinolones, heterocyclic compounds, and sulfoxides were obtained with high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance under very mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, benefiting from the inherent advantage of heterogenous photocatalysis, prominent sustainability and easy photocatalyst recyclability, a drug molecule (modafinil) and an oxidized mustard gas simulant (2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide) were selectively and easily obtained in scale&#8208;up reactions. Mechanistic investigations were conducted using radical quenching experiments and in&#8197;situ ESR spectroscopy, all corroborating the proposed role of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;1 in photocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Programmed Multiple C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization of the Privileged 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline Template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of substituents on a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline was selectively achieved by directed multiple C&#8722;H functionalizations. It could be decorated on four positions, successively at C&#8208;8, C&#8208;2, C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;5, three of which by using transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.







Abstract
The introduction of substituents on bare heterocyclic scaffolds can selectively be achieved by directed C&#8722;H functionalization. However, such methods have only occasionally been used, in an iterative manner, to decorate various positions of a medicinal scaffold to build chemical libraries. We herein report the multiple, site selective, metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of a &#8220;programmed&#8221; 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. This medicinally privileged template indeed possesses multiple reactive sites for diversity&#8208;oriented functionalization, of which four were targeted. The C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;8 decorations were directed by an N&#8208;oxide, before taking benefit of an O&#8208;carbamoyl protection at C&#8208;4 to perform a Fries rearrangement and install a carboxamide at C&#8208;3. This also released the carbonyl group of 4&#8208;quinolones, the ultimate directing group to functionalize position 5. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8722;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emitters Exhibiting Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Derived from Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Triplet States of Naphthalenediimide&#8722;Halobenzoate Triad Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple naphthalenediimide derivative with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in both solid and aqueous dispersion is demonstrated. The spin&#8208;orbit coupling values are evaluated using TD&#8208;DFT calculations and show that the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interaction and the positions of iodine as heavy atom are essential to realize efficient RTP.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters have attracted significant attention. However, purely organic RTP emitters in red to near&#8208;infrared region have not been properly investigated. In this study, a series of naphthalenediimide&#8722;halobenzoate&#8208;linked molecules are synthesized, one of which exhibits efficient RTP properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in solid and aqueous dispersion. Spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis have shown that the difference in the stacking modes of compounds affects the optical properties, and the formation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes of naphthalenediimide&#8722;halobenzoate moiety results in a bathochromic shift of absorption and RTP properties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations showed that the formation of charge&#8208;transfer triplet states and the external heavy atom effect of the halogen atom enhance the intersystem crossing between excited singlet and triplet states.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A simple naphthalenediimide&lt;/b&gt; derivative with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in both solid and aqueous dispersion is demonstrated. The spin&#8208;orbit coupling values are evaluated using TD&#8208;DFT calculations and show that the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interaction and the positions of iodine as heavy atom are essential to realize efficient RTP.

         <title>Natural&#8208;Like Spirocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Butenolides Obtained from Diazo Homophthalimides</title>

         <dc:description>
Natural&#8208;like &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides were accessed via Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed O&#8722;H insertion into propiolic acids followed by DIPEA&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Michael addition. The resulting spirocyclic Michael acceptors were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein cancer target. Moreover, some of these compounds were shown to selectively bind selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Diazo homophotalimides were reacted with various propiolic acids on Rh2(esp)2 catalysis. The resulting propiolate esters were transformed into novel, heterocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides in good to excellent product yields. The approach represents a fundamentally novel entry into natural&#8208;like &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides present in many biologically active natural products as well as fully synthetic compounds endowed with diverse biological activities. The &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;spirobutenolides thus obtained were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenocysteine enzyme target for cancer. Moreover, for the best compound in the series (TrxR IC50 1.49&#177;0.08&#8197;&#956;M), by using MALDI&#8208;TOF mass&#8208;spectrometry it was shown that it selectively binds selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine. This validates the new compound as a promising lead for anticancer therapy development.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Derived from Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Cross&#8208;Linked Triazine Polymers for Simultaneously Achieving CO2 Capture and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high surface area and high nitrogen content porous carbon was obtained by the rational design and pyrolysis of cross&#8208;linked triazine polymers. Such porous carbon as a CO2 adsorbent, exhibits a high CO2 adsorption capability at 5.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298.15&#8197;K and excellent stability. As an anode for supercapacitors, it delivers A&#8201;good specific capacitance of 158.8&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
It is highly desirable to design advanced heteroatomic doped porous carbon for wide application. Herein, N&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) was developed via the fabrication of high nitrogen cross&#8208;linked triazine polymers followed by pyrolysis and activation with controllable porous structure. The as&#8208;synthesized NPC at the pyrolysis temperature of 700&#8201;&#176;C possessed rich nitrogen content (up to 11.51&#8201;%) and high specific surface area (1353&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which led to a high CO2 adsorption capability at 5.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298.15&#8197;K and 5&#8197;bar pressure and excellent stability. When the activation temperature was at 600&#8201;&#176;C, such NPC exhibited a superior electrochemical performance as anode for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 158.8 and 113&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 6&#8197;M KOH at a current density of 1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Notably, it delivered an excellent stability with capacity retention of 97.4&#8201;% at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1after 6000 cycles.

         <title>Preparation and Properties of Benzylsulfonyl&#8208;Containing Silicone Copolymers via Ring&#8208;opening Copolymerization of Macroheterocyclosiloxane and Cyclosiloxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated for the first time. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. Notably, the obtained polymers with adjustable structures and benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane content possessed composition&#8208;dependent properties, including thermal, surface, and mechanical characteristics. The copolymers also emitted blue fluorescence due to the clustering&#8208;triggered emission and luminescence of nonconventional luminogens.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCP) of benzylsulfonyl macroheterocyclosiloxane (BSM) and five different cyclosiloxanes was systematically investigated. A general approach for the synthesis of benzylsulfonyl&#8208;containing silicone copolymers with various substituents, including methyl, vinyl, ethyl, and phenyl, was developed herein. A series of copolymers with variable incorporation (from 6&#8201;% to 82&#8201;%) of BSM were obtained by modifying the comonomer feed ratio and using KOH as the catalyst in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide and toluene. The obtained copolymers exhibited various composition&#8208;dependent properties and unique viscoelasticity. Notably, the surface and fluorescent characteristics as well as the glass transition temperatures of the copolymers could be tailored by varying the amount of BSM. Unlike typical sulfone&#8208;containing polymers, such as poly(olefin sulfone)s, the prepared copolymers displayed excellent thermal and hydrolytic stability. The universal strategy developed in the present study provides a platform for the design of innovative silicone copolymers with adjustable structures and performance.

         <title>Intertwined Analytical, Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Formation and Structure of a Copper Dienolate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intertwined analytical, experimental and theoretical study disclose the mechanism of formation of an organocopper dienolate reagent from its silylated precursor. The study shed light on the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction process, the Si to Cu exchange mechanism and finally the metallotropic equilibrium of the resulting copper dienolate.







Abstract
The reaction of a silyl dienolate, a Cu(II) salt and TBAT yielding the corresponding copper dienolate is addressed. A combined NMR and cyclic voltammetry analysis first highlight the role of TBAT in the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and the structure of the precatalytic species. From these first results a second set of NMR and theoretical studies enable the determination of the structure and the mechanism of formation of the copper dienolate catalytic species. Finally, we showed that that the copper catalyst promote the E/Z s&#8208;cis/s&#8208;trans equilibration of the silyl dienolate precursor through a copper dienolate intermediate. All of these results unveil some peculiarities of the catalytic and asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama reaction.

A combined NMR and cyclic voltammetry analysis first highlight the role of TBAT in the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction and the structure of the precatalytic species. From these first results a second set of NMR and theoretical studies enable the determination of the structure and the mechanism of formation of the copper dienolate catalytic species. Finally, we showed that that the copper catalyst promote the E/Z s&#8208;cis/s&#8208;trans equilibration of the silyl dienolate precursor through a copper dienolate intermediate. All of these results unveil some peculiarities of the catalytic and asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Insights into the Molecular Recognition Mechanism of the Cancer and Pathogenic Epitope, LacdiNAc by Immune&#8208;Related Lectins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular determinants that govern the binding of the tumour and pathogenic LacdiNAc (LDN) epitope by two human lectins, hGal&#8208;3 and hMGL, including the comparison with the natural LacNAc (LN) epitope, were unveiled. These findings are essential for chemical designing mimetics to selective target hGal&#8208;3 and hMGL.







Abstract
Interactions of glycan&#8208;specific epitopes to human lectin receptors represent novel immune checkpoints for investigating cancer and infection diseases. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we investigated the molecular determinants that govern the recognition of the tumour and pathogenic glycobiomarker LacdiNAc (GalNAc&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LDN), including their comparison with the ubiquitous LacNAc epitope (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LN), by two human immune&#8208;related lectins, galectin&#8208;3 (hGal&#8208;3) and the macrophage galactose C&#8208;type lectin (hMGL). A different mechanism of binding and interactions was observed for the hGal&#8208;3/LDN and hMGL/LDN complexes, which explains the remarkable difference in the binding specificity of LDN and LN by these two lectins. The new structural clues reported herein are fundamental for the chemical design of mimetics targeting hGal&#8208;3/hMGL recognition process.

         <title>Quadruple Photoresponsive Functionality in a Crystalline Hybrid Material: Photochromism, Photomodulated Fluorescence, Magnetism and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline hybrid material is reported with quadruple photoresponsive functionality, which shows photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence, magnetism, and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties. This work provides a general method to construct hybrid photochromic materials with multiple photoresponsive performances.







Abstract
As promising photoresponsive materials and potential smart materials, hybrid photochromic materials (HPMs), especially for crystalline HPMs (CHPMs), have been broadly explored for their potential in inheriting the merits of each constituents, and intriguing photomodulated functionality. Hitherto, the photoresponsive functionality in explored CHPMs mainly concentrate on dyad combination. By contrast, triple or quadruple photoresponsive properties are very rare because of the limited compatibility of multiple photoresponsive functionality in a single system. In this work, the electron&#8208;transfer (ET) and crystal engineering strategies were utilized to predesign CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive properties via the collaboration of paramagnetic metal ion (Dy3+), electron&#8208;donor (ED) ligand (benzene&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, H3BTA) and electron&#8208;acceptor (EA) ligand (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, phen). The resulting complex [Dy(BTA)(phen)2]&#8901;2H2O (1) shows hybrid chain with the intrachain Dy3+ ions bridged and chelated by tricarboxylate and phen ligands, respectively. After photostimuli, the ET between tricarboxylate and phen results in photogenerated radicals and the resultant quadruple photoresponsive properties. Considering the abundant resources of paramagnetic metal ions, ED&#8208; and EA&#8208;ligands, this work provides a general method to construct CHPMs with multiple photoresponsive performances via the collaboration of each unit under the guidance of ET and crystal engineering strategies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Multivalent Ag&#8208;SR Coordination Polymers with Phosphatase&#8208;Like Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;assembled multivalent Ag&#8208;SR coordination polymers with high phosphatase&#8208;like activity have been developed. This work represents a new alternative for the future rational design of highly efficient catalysts for hydrolysis of phosphates and carboxylates.







Abstract
We show herein the phosphatase&#8208;like catalytic activity of coordination polymers obtained after adding Ag+&#8208;ions to thiols bearing hydrophobic alkyl chains terminated with a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) group. The subsequent addition of Zn2+ &#8208;ions to the self&#8208;assembled polymers resulted in the formation of multivalent metal coordination polymers capable of catalysing the transphosphorylation of an RNA&#8208;model compound (2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate, HPNPP) with high reactivity. Analysis of a series of metal ions showed that the highest catalytic activity was obtained when Ag+&#8208;ions were used as the first metal ions to construct the backbone of the coordination polymer through interaction with the &#8208;SH group followed by Zn2+&#8208;ions as the second metal ions complexed by the TACN&#8208;macrocycle. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the catalytic activity could be modulated by changing the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Partially Saturated Fluorenyl&#8208;Derived [n]Helicenes Featuring an Overcrowded Alkene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blocking a molecular motor: The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (see figure), cyclic analogs of the well&#8208;known Feringa's molecular motors, are produced via a similar McMurry cyclization approach. While being composed of three diastereoisomers, they serve as valuable intermediates for the efficient, multi&#8208;gram scale access to the aromatic fluoreno[n]helicenes.







Abstract
The straightforward, multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes (n=5 or 7) featuring a central, overcrowded alkene is described. The key cyclization step was based on an intramolecular McMurry reaction from the corresponding 1,5&#8208;diketones. Chiral stationary phase HPLC analysis and isomer separation indicate that each helicenic compound is constituted of three diastereoisomers at room temperature, i.&#8201;e. the configurationally stable (R,R,P)/(S,S,M) pair of enantiomers and an apparently achiral compound resulting from the rapid interconversion between the (R,S,P) and (S,R,M) enantiomers. The partially saturated H6&#8208;fluoreno[n]helicenes are oxidatively aromatized to give an efficient access to the corresponding fluoreno[n]helicenes. The chiroptical properties (vibrational and electronic circular dichroism) of the chiral, enantiopure compounds have been measured and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, confirming their helicoidal nature.

The covalent functionalization of pristine graphene activated by metal substrates towards nitrenes is presented. Observed rate constants reveal that graphene supported on Ni (G/Ni) has the highest reactivity towards nitrenes, followed by G/Cu and then G/silicon wafer. DFT results indicate that increased charge transfer to graphene contribute to the higher reactivity with G/Ni. These results suggest that substrate activation represents an effective and novel strategy for functionalizing graphene using nitrenes potentially extending to other electron deficient reactants.







Abstract
Pristine graphene is fairly inert chemically, and as such, most application&#8208;driven studies use graphene oxide, or reduced graphene oxide. Using substrates to modulate the reactivity of graphene represents a unique strategy in the covalent functionalization of this otherwise fairly inert material. It was found that the reactivity of pristine graphene towards perfluorophenyl azide (PFPA) can be enhanced by a metal substrate on which graphene is supported. Results on the extent of functionalization, defect density, and reaction kinetics all show that graphene supported on Ni (G/Ni) has the highest reactivity toward PFPA, followed by G/Cu and then G/silicon wafer. DFT calculations suggest that the metal substrate stabilizes the physisorbed nitrene through enhanced electron transfer to the singlet nitrene from the graphene surface assisted by the electron rich metal substrate. The G/Ni substantially stabilizes the singlet nitrene relative to G/Cu and the free&#8208;standing graphene. The product structure is also predicted to be substrate dependent. These findings open up opportunities to enhance the reactivity of pristine graphene simply through the selection of the substrate. This also represents a new and powerful approach to increasing the reactivity of singlet nitrenes through direct electronic communication with graphene.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin and High&#8208;Spin Perferryl Intermediates in Non&#8208;Heme Iron Catalyzed Oxidations of Aliphatic C&#8722;H Groups</title>

Direct C&#8722;H activation: Investigation of the oxidation of aliphatic C&#8722;H groups in the presence of nonheme iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family exhibits no uniform correlation between the spin state and reactivity of the oxoiron(V) intermediates and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems, thus witnessing apparent violation of the common &#8220;reactivity&#8208;selectivity&#8221; principle for this reaction.







Abstract
The selectivity patterns of iron catalysts of the Fe(PDP) family in aliphatic C&#8722;H oxidation with H2O2 have been studied (PDP=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrolidine). Cyclohexane, adamantane, 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyloctane, 3,7&#8208;dimethyloctyl acetate, (&#8722;)&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;p&#8208;menthane, and cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane were used as substrates. The studied catalyst systems generate low&#8208;spin (S=1/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates or high&#8208;spin (S=3/2) oxoiron(V) intermediates, depending on the electron&#8208;donating ability of remote substituents at the pyridine rings. The low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates demonstrate lower stability and higher reactivity toward aliphatic C&#8722;H groups of cyclohexane than their high&#8208;spin congeners, according to the measured self&#8208;decay and second&#8208;order rate constants k1 and k2. Unexpectedly, there appears to be no uniform correlation between the spin state of the oxoiron(V) intermediates, and the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the corresponding catalyst systems in the oxidation of the considered substrates. This contrasts with the asymmetric epoxidations by the same catalyst systems, in which case the epoxidation enantioselectivity increases when passing from the systems featuring the more reactive low&#8208;spin perferryl intermediates to those with their less reactive high&#8208;spin congeners.

A dynamic covalent Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated and applied to the generation of dynamic catalyst systems. The systems exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives, as well as systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction.







Abstract
Understanding the emergence of function in complex reaction networks is a primary goal of systems chemistry and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life studies. Especially challenging is to create systems that simultaneously exhibit several emergent functions that can be independently tuned. In this work, a multifunctional complex reaction network of nucleophilic small molecule catalysts for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated. The dynamic system exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives. By utilizing selective reversibility of the products of the reaction set, systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction could also be introduced. To achieve this, a dynamic covalent MBH reaction based on adducts with internal H&#8208;transfer capabilities was developed. By careful tuning of the substituents, rate accelerations of retro&#8208;MBH reactions of up to four orders of magnitude could be obtained. This study thus demonstrates how efficient self&#8208;sorting of catalytic systems can be achieved through an interplay of several complex emergent functionalities.

         <title>Proton&#8208;transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pK  a  value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1 ps. With a pK  a  drop of 8.7 units to &#8208;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the  ortho  &#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a&#160;Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethyl acetate is an important chemical raw material and solvent. It is also a key volatile organic compound in the brewing industry and a marker for lung cancer. Materials that are highly selective toward ethyl acetate are needed for its separation and detection. Here, we report a trianglimine macrocycle ( TAMC ) that selectively adsorbs ethyl acetate by forming a solvate. Crystal structure prediction showed this to be the lowest energy solvate structure available. This solvate leaves a metastable, &#8216;templated&#8217; cavity after solvent removal. Adsorption and breakthrough experiments confirmed that imprinted TAMC has adequate adsorption kinetics to separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol, which is a challenging and energy&#8208;intensive industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Guanidine&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite with Strong Dichroism for Multiwavelength Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts. Here, for the first time, we fabricated the multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive detectors using single crystals of a guanidine&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  (where BA  +  is  n  &#8208;butylammonium and GA  +  is guanidium). Its unique 2D quantum&#8208;well structure results in strong crystallographic&#8208;dependence of optical absorption. Strikingly, our crystal&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a prominent photocurrent dichroic ratio (  I  max  /  I  min  ) of ~2.2 at 520 nm, higher than the typical 2D inorganic materials (GeSe, ~1.09, PdSe  2  , ~1.8). Besides, notable dichroic ratios of 1.29 and 1.23 at 405 nm and 637 nm are also created for the multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection. The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10  &#8208;11  A), considerable on/off ratio (~2&#215;10  3  ), high photodetectivity (~3.3&#215;10  11  Jones) and responsivity (~12.01 mA&#183;W  &#8208;1  ), make (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts.

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here we describe a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid  in silico  analysis of protein sequences. The method pinpoints 6&#8210;12 single mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various  d  /  l  &#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic DNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;based recognition promote an RNA&#8208;templated bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates which bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacant Manganese&#8208;Based Perovskite Fluorides@Reduced Graphene Oxides for Na&#8208;ion Storage with Pseudocapacitive Conversion/Insertion Dual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na&#8208;ion capacitors  (NICs) and Na&#8208;ion&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have been considered to be promising alternatives to traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) because of Na&#8208;ion abundance and low cost, but their energy density, power density and cycle life are limited.  Herein, d  ual vacancies (including K  +  and F  &#8208;  vacancies) perovskite fluoride K  0.86  MnF  2.69  @  reduced graphene oxide  (rGO) (recorded as Mn&#8208;G) as anode for NICs and Na&#8208;DIBs have been developed. The special conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion  energy storage mechanism  and pseudocapacitive dynamics are analyzed in detail.  The Mn&#8208;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8208;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs delivered  a maximum energy density of 92.7 Wh kg  &#8208;1  and 187.6 Wh kg  &#8208;1  , maximum power density of 20.2 kW kg  &#8208;1  and 21.12 kW kg  &#8208;1  , and long cycle performance of 61.3% and 68.4% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  , respectively. Moreover, Mn&#8208;G//AC NICs  and Mn&#8208;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs can work well in a wide range of temperatures (&#8208;20&#8208;40 &#176;C).  This result makes it competitive in Na&#8208;ion storage applications with high energy/power density in a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites for Low Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In an effort to combine the favorable catalytic properties of Co3O4 and CeO2, nanocomposites with different phase distribution and Co3O4 loading were prepared and employed for CO oxidation. Synthesizing Co3O4&#8208;modified CeO2 via three different sol&#8208;gel based routes, each with 10.4 wt% Co3O4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides and homogeneously dispersed Co. The reactivity of the resulting surface oxygen species towards CO were examined by temperature programmed reduction (CO&#8208;TPR) and flow reactor kinetic tests. The first morphology exhibited the best performance due to its active Co3O4 surface layer, reducing the light&#8208;off temperature of CeO2 by about 200 &#8451;. In contrast, intermixed oxides and Co&#8208;doped CeO2 suffered from lower dispersion and organic residues, respectively. The performance of Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites was optimized by varying the Co3O4 loading, characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption (BET). The 16&#8208;65 wt% Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 catalysts approached the conversion of 1 wt% Pt/CeO2, rendering them interesting candidates for low temperature CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Direct Electrochemical Methanol Reforming Enabled by CO&#8208;Immune Mo&#8208;based Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen storage in the form of intermediate artificial fuels such as methanol is important for future chemical and energy applications, and the electrochemical regeneration of hydrogen from methanol is thermodynamically favorable compared to direct water splitting. However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H  2  evolution catalysts and drastically reduce catalyst activity. In this study, we report and explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo&#8208;containing H  2  evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo&#8208;based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo in electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the HER in these systems. This specific property of Mo&#8208;based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons may be present.</dc:description>

         <title>Distorted Porphyrins with High Stability: Synthesis and Characteristic Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Nuclear Tricarbonyl Rhenium Tetraazaporphyrin Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin complexes (  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  ) are investigated and compared with Re(I) phthalocyanine complexes (  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ). Although  Re&#8322;Pc  is unstable in polar solvents, which easily undergoes demetallation reaction, the coordination of the TAP ligand significantly improves the tolerance toward polar solvents, affording more stability to  Re&#8322;TAP  . Additionally, the incorporation of [Re(CO)&#8323;]  +  unit(s) and the TAP ligand results in remarkable positive shifts in both oxidation and reduction potentials. Consequently, the more positive oxidation potentials of the ReTAP complexes significantly increase the tolerance toward oxidation, while the reduction potential indicates that  Re&#8322;TAP  is suitable for a soluble electron acceptor. In contrast to  Re&#8321;Pc  and  Re&#8322;Pc  ,  Re&#8321;TAP  and  Re&#8322;TAP  show unique broad Q bands, which can be attributed to the admixture of the &#960;&#8211;&#960;* and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characters, owing to the lowered &#960; orbital energy in the TAP complexes.&#160;This study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of a Uranium(III)&#8208;Carbon Multiple Bond Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent uranium&#8208;element multiple bond complexes are scarce, though there is burgeoning interest regarding to their bonding and reactivity. Herein, isolation of a uranium(III)&#8208;carbon double bond complex [(Cp*) 2 U(CDP)](BPh 4 ) ( 1 ) comprising a tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) as ligand is reported for the first time. Oxidation of 1 afforded the corresponding U(IV) complex [(Cp*) 2 U(CDP)](BPh 4 ) 2 ( 2 ). The interatomic distance between U and C in 2 is 2.481 &#197;, indicating a typical U=C double bond, which is further confirmed by quantum chemical &#160; calculations. Bonding analysis suggests that the CDP ligand serves as both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donor in complex 1 where a longer U&#8208;C bond (2.666(3) &#197;) is observed. The results indicate that 1 is the first mononuclear uranium(III) carbene complex that could be isolated. These results suggest that CDPs are promising ligands to establish other low&#8208;valent f &#8208;block metal&#8208;carbon multiple bond complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Tungsten Oxide: Recent Advances in Design, Synthesis&#160;and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide (WO3) has grown continuous attention and has been highly researched over the last decade credited to being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with a tunable yet widely stable band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights design and synthesis&#160; challenges of porous WO3  &#160;including methods, precursors, solvents effects, crystal phase, and &#160;the surface activity of the porous WO3  base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impacts the optical properties of tungsten but also allows&#160; tuning to operate on different energy levels which makes WO3  highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Click and Release Chemistry for Activity&#8208;Based Purification of &#946;&#8208;Lactam Targets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of antibiotic resistance requires innovative strategies for the identification of drug targets and the characterization of the emerging mechanisms of resistance. This is the case for the highly diverse and complex targets of &#946;&#8208;lactams that include essential biosynthetic enzymes, the transpeptidases, unessential hydrolases involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, and unknown enzymes. The findings reported here should have important implications in this context, as they propose an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Arthur, M. Fonvielle, M. Etheve&#8208;Quelquejeu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100653).

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of Bicarbonate Unravelled</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of synthetic bicarbonate transporters is of high interest for potential therapeutic applications. This work presents a new assay to study bicarbonate transport, based on a europium complex that is encapsulated inside liposomes and reports changes in the intravesicular concentration of bicarbonate in a direct and highly sensitive way. The assay revealed that transporters can act via different mechanisms, involving actual transport of HCO3&#8722; anions or passive diffusion of CO2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Butler, H. Valkenier, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100491).

         <title>Metal Cation&#8208;Driven Dynamic Covalent Formation of Imine and Hydrazone Ligands Displaying Synergistic Co&#8208;catalysis and Auxiliary Amine Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine and hydrazone formation is strongly driven by metal ions and the latter also displays a synergistic effect of both metal ions and an auxiliary amine. The rate acceleration occurs both in stoichiometric and catalytic conditions, displaying a true catalysis of imine and hydrazone formation. The synergistic metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis relates to the construction of complex dynamic systems.







Abstract
Optimizing C=N bond formation and C/N component exchange has major significance in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). Imine and hydrazone generation from their aldehyde, amine and hydrazine components showed large accelerations in presence of AgOTf or Zn(OTf)2, up to 104 for the Zn(II)&#8208;(p&#8208;anisidine)imine complex. Zn(OTf)2 and auxiliary p&#8208;anisidine together accelerated 630 times the formation of the Zn(II)&#8208;hydrazone complex, revealing a strong synergistic effect, traced to very fast initial formation of the reactive Zn(II)&#8208;imine complex presenting a C=N bond metallo&#8208;activated towards reaction with the hydrazine component. Reactions involving more entities showed kinetically faster and thermodynamically simpler outputs due to dynamic competition within a mixture of higher complexity. Catalytic amounts of metal salts and auxiliary amine gave similar marked rate accelerations and turnover, indicating true catalysis. The synergistic effect achieved by combining metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis points to a powerful co&#8208;catalysis strategy of bond&#8208;formation in DCC through interconnected chemical transformations.

         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. We developed a versatile synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1 g L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and turnover frequency (5.9 h&#8211;1) for at least 3 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS  2  &#160;nanosheets  via  &#160;a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS  2  &#160;and Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;alone, and the optimal WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. We proved that the addition of Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;can enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS  2  , and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W:Fe=2:1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows&#160;a low overpotential of ~&#160;0.172&#160;V at 10 mA&#160;cm  &#8208;  2  , low&#160;Tafel slope of ~&#160;53.47 mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst for HER.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Control of Peptide Conformation with Light and Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure whose conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Here, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and a shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. We find that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn  2+  . The other metal ions (Cu  2+  , Fe  3+  , Co  2+  , Mg  2+  and Ni  2+  ) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn  2+  supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azolesthrough Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalizations have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird's eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalizations of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship for Di&#8208; up to Tetranuclear Macrocyclic Ruthenium Catalysts in Homogeneous Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized two di&#8208; and tetranuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6'&#8208;dicarboxylate) macrocyclic complexes and investigated their catalytic activities in chemical and photochemical water oxidation in a comparative manner to our previously reported trinuclear congener. Our studies have shown that the catalytic activities of this homologous series of multinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles in homogeneous water oxidation are dependent on their size, exhibiting highest efficiencies for the largest tetranuclear catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) have increased from di&#8208; to tetranuclear macrocycles not only per catalyst molecule but more importantly also per Ru unit with TOF of 6 s&#8208;1 to 8.7 s&#8208;1 and 10.5 s&#8208;1 in chemical and 0.6 s&#8208;1 to 3.3 s&#8208;1 and 5.8 s&#8208;1 in photochemical water oxidation per Ru unit, respectively. Thus, for the first time, a clear structure&#8208;activity relationship could be established for this novel class of macrocyclic water oxidation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>From BN Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of benzoborole polyanions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2a and 2c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in excellent yield. Reaction of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with MeI yielded the lithium borate 4c, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work we report a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches. We show that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. We also demonstrate that host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t  1/2  = 107 hours vs t  1/2  = 1.2 hours for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO  2.67  (Ba  3  Co  3  O  8  &#9633;  1  ) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba  0.5  Sr  0.5  Co  0.8  Fe  0.2  O  3&#8722;  y  , confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05 eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3 kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn3&#8208;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructure substantially enhances comparing with pristine Mn  3  O  4  . Particularly, in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  with a typical diameter of 20 nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987 Fg  &#8208;1  at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 Ag  &#8208;1  , respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at a power density of 0.75 kW kg  &#8208;1  , which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Improbable Foldamer Shapes with Strained Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of some secondary amide functions with a dimethoxybenzyl (DMB) group in oligomers of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid destabilizes the otherwise favored helical conformations, and allows for cyclization to take place. A cyclic hexamer and a cyclic heptamer were produced in this manner. After DMB removal, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR show that the macrocycles adopt strained conformations that would be improbable in non&#8208;cyclic species. The high helix folding propensity of the main chain is partly expressed in these conformations, but it remains frustrated by macrocyclization. Despite being homomeric, the macrocycles possess inequivalent monomer units. Experimental and computational studies highlight specific fluxional pathways within these structures. Extensive simulated annealing molecular dynamics allow for the prediction of the conformations for larger macrocycles with up to sixteen monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Hydrazide as a Pluripotent Precursor for On&#8208;DNA Synthesis of Various Azole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phylogenic chemical transformation approach to synthesize on&#8208;DNA 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole, 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amine and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as pluripotent precursor are reported here, which shows great potential in facilitating rapid construction of azole&#8208;focused DELs.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar morphologies with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) are achieved by the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules. The driven force for the phase separation is attributed to the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. Upon the gamma ray radiation followed pyrolysis, ultra&#8208;thin two dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets are obtained due to polymerization of vinyl group in VPOSS.







Abstract
Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.&#8201;g., below 5&#8197;nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. In this work, the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains are presented. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.

         <title>Affinity selections of DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries on carbonic anhydrase IX&#8208;expressing tumor cells reveal a dependence on ligand valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; K  D  = 8.7 nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Formation, Solution Rearrangements, and Catalytic Behavior of a Polymorphic Ca/K Allyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical synthesis provides the metastable organocalciate K[CaA&#8217;3] (A&#8217;= 1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3), whose &#8216;first contact&#8217; with solvent determines how fast it rearranges to a more stable form: minutes (in hexanes) to days (in arenes). The latter form of the calciate initiates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene under mild conditions.







Abstract
Without solvents present, the often far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium environment in a mechanochemically driven synthesis can generate high&#8208;energy, non&#8208;stoichiometric products not observed from the same ratio of reagents used in solution. Ball milling 2&#8197;equiv. K[A&#8217;] (A&#8217;=[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3]&#8722;) with CaI2 yields a non&#8208;stoichiometric calciate, K[CaA&#8217;3], which initially forms a structure (1) likely containing a mixture of pi&#8208; and sigma&#8208;bound allyl ligands. Dissolved in arenes, the compound rearranges over the course of several days to a structure (2) with only &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligands, and that can be crystallized as a coordination polymer. If dissolved in alkanes, however, the rearrangement of 1 to 2 occurs within minutes. The structures of 1 and 2 have been modeled with DFT calculations, and 2 initiates the anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene; for the latter, under the mildest conditions yet reported for a heavy Group 2 species (one&#8208;atm pressure and room temperature).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R  3  P),  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8208;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8208;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8208;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8208;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8208;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective production of linear aldehydes and alcohols from alkenes using formic acid as syngas surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing carbonylation without the use of carbon monoxide for high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is an attractive yet challenging topic in sustainable chemistry. Herein, effective methods for producing linear aldehydes or alcohols selectively with formic acid as both carbon monoxide and hydrogen source have been described. Linear&#8208;selective hydroformylation of alkenes proceeds smoothly with up to 88% yield and &gt; 30 regioselectivity in the presence of single Rh catalyst. Strikingly, introducing Ru into the system, the dual Rh/Ru catalysts accomplish efficient and regioselective hydroxymethylation in one pot. The present processes utilizing formic acid as syngas surrogate operate simply under mild condition, which opens a sustainable way for production of linear aldehydes and alcohols without the need for gas cylinders and autoclaves. As formic acid can be readily produced via CO 2 hydrogenation, the protocols represent indirect approaches for chemical valorization of CO 2 .</dc:description>

A simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). After being carbonised at 700&#8201;&#176;C, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55&#8201;%) and the lowest impedance Rct (117&#8197;&#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PANIA&#8208;CF&#8208;700 to 190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Cyano Derivatives of 7&#8208;Aminoquinoline that are Highly Emissive in Water: Potential for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline was synthesized and found to be non&#8208;emissive in water, while the amino derivative 6CN&#8722;7AQ exhibits intense emission, making the azido/amino pair excellent in sensing H2S. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with peptide renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive composite that can be digested by proteinase&#8208;K, recovering intense 6CN&#8722;7AQ emission with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.







Abstract
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7AQ) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7AQ) were synthesized and found to exhibit intense emission with quantum yield as high as 63&#8201;% and 85&#8201;%, respectively, in water. Conversely, their derivatives 6&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7N3Q) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7N3Q) show virtually no emission, which makes them suitable to be used as recognition agents in azide reactions based on fluorescence recovery. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with a hydrophobic biomembrane&#8208;penetration peptide PFVYLI renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ&#8208;PFVYLI composite, which can be digested by proteinase K, recovering the highly emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement. The result provides an effective early confirmation for RT&#8208;qPCR in viral detection.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties as a function of their textural and chemical features. Experimental and theoretical data indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold. For the best performing COF, a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures were investigated, showing excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;Pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) ion&#8208;pair heteroditopic cryptands exhibit cooperative recognition of potassium halide salts. Incorporation of bidentate triazole&#8208;based ChB or XB donor motifs into a dibenzo&#8208;30&#8208;crown&#8208;10&#8208;based macrobicyclic receptor framework is demonstrated to profoundly influence selectivity and affinity behaviour towards the recognition of KBr and KI ion&#8208;pairs relative to hydrogen bonding analogues.







Abstract
A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated.

     alt="Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;Pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chalcogen bonding (ChB)&lt;/b&gt; and halogen bonding (XB) ion&#8208;pair heteroditopic cryptands exhibit cooperative recognition of potassium halide salts. Incorporation of bidentate triazole&#8208;based ChB or XB donor motifs into a dibenzo&#8208;30&#8208;crown&#8208;10&#8208;based macrobicyclic receptor framework is demonstrated to profoundly influence selectivity and affinity behaviour towards the recognition of KBr and KI ion&#8208;pairs relative to hydrogen bonding analogues.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated. Saliently, the co&#8208;bound potassium cation was determined to be crucial in switching on the bromide and iodide recognition properties of the respective cryptand receptor. Importantly, the nature of the sigma&#8208;hole mediated interaction employed in the anion recognition component is demonstrated to significantly augment the ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour, markedly so for the halogen bonding analogue. Most notably the incorporation of a chelating chalcogen bonding donor motif significantly improves the selectivity towards KBr over KI, relative to halogen and hydrogen bonding analogues.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of aza[6] and [7]helicene&#8208;like molecules have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 2&#8208;methoxynaphthalene&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;linked cyanodiynes.

         <title>The Versatile Electronic, Magnetic and Photo&#8208;electro Catalytic Activity of a New 2D MA2Z4 Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent successful growth of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayer led to the discovery of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MA2Z4 materials with no known 3D layered allotropes, which renders great possibilities to integrate diverse properties by proper design of sandwiched &#8220;MZ2&#8221; building blocks and &#8220;A&#8208;Z&#8221; passivation layers. In this work, we theoretically probe the dynamic stability, electronic properties, and surface reactivity of the new MA2Z4 family, in which M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, A refers to Si or Ge, and Z is N, P or As. Among the proposed 54 possible combinations, about 42 compositions are dynamically stable, which vary from non&#8208;magnetic, anti&#8208;ferromagnetic, to ferromagnetic semiconductors, metals and half&#8208;metal. In particular, the VB (V, Nb, Ta) MA2Z4 possesses robust intrinsic ferromagnetism that is essential for spintronics applications. In regards to surface activity, most of MA2Z4, particularly for N or P terminated IVB and VB MA2Z4, have high catalytic potential for hydrogen evolution, and the &#8710;GH of non&#8208;magnetic MA2Z4 is highly correlated to the highest occupied p electronic states of surface Z atom. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity is also evaluated, MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 within 4% tensile strain are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Our findings indicate the new 2D MA2Z4 family has fascinating properties and possesses strong potential for applications but not limited to electronics, spintronics and catalysts, which will stimulate the interests of experimental synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>First total synthesis of phytoprostanes with prostaglandin&#8208;like&#160;configuration, evidence for their formation in edible vegetable oils and orienting study of their biological activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(9&#8208;  epi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer&#160;  ent  &#8208;16&#8208;  epi  &#8208; PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(  ent  &#8208;9,16&#8208;  diepi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F  1  &#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F  2t  &#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF  2&#945;  &#160;(FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Src kinase activity by selective substrate recognition with pseudopeptidic cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective recognition of tyrosine (Tyr) residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibit their phosphorylation mediated by tyrosine kinases (TKs). Here we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect the substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. The most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates as shown by fluorescence emission titrations, with a very good correlation between the binding constants and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism by the selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heptacene (  1  ) was produced through a monoketone precursor (  2  ), which was prepared starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene through 9 steps in a total yield of 10%. Compound  2  was converted to  1  quantitatively by heating at 202 &#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of  1  as a material for  p  &#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), the top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum&#8208;deposition of  1  on a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO  2  /Si substrate. The best performance of hole mobility was 2.2 cm  2  V  &#8211;1  s  &#8211;1  . This is the first report that stable heptacene was used in an effective device and examined on its charge carrier property.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes With Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (  1a  +  ,  1b  +  ) or thioxanthylium (  1c  +  ) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism. UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  alongside diamagnetic forms  1a  +  &#8208;1c  +  , which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches.

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel photoswitches based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.







Abstract
A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to common types of Au(I) coordination, such as linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral units observed in extended solids, the square planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia, shown in the cover image, exhibits the 3&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8208;Tt&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn&#8208;Au (on her feathers), square planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her pendant), and linear &#8230;&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;&#8230; chains (her legs) that are characteristic of the novel equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds. The image was created by designer Grant Luhmann. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kovnir et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005312).
