         <title>Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalyzed Synthesis of Bifuran&#8208;Based Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel&#8208;bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine&#8208;substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon&#8208;based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis. The reported method avoids using a sacrificial anode by employing triethanolamine as an electron donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a]Pyridine Carboxamide and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite remarkable successes in linear and branched vinyl (hetero) arene synthesis, regiodivergent C&#8208;H olefination with a single catalytic system has remained underdeveloped. Overcoming this limitation, herein, we report Pd/MPAA mediated regiodivergent olefination protocol of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamide and unactivated alkenes to generate branched and linear olefinated products depending upon the electronic nature of alkenes. Moreover, this protocol can be applied for C&#8208;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O as deuterium source. Preliminary experimental studies combined with computational investigations (DFT studies) suggest that regiodivergent olefination can be controlled by olefin insertion and b&#8208;hydride elimination steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexanuclear Ln6L6&#160;Complex Formation by using an Unsymmetric Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinuclear, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes present clear opportunities as sensors and imaging agents. Despite the widely acknowledged potential of this class of supramolecule, synthetic and characterization challenges continue to limit systematic studies into their self&#8208;assembly restricting the number and variety of lanthanide architectures reported relative to their transition metal counterparts. Here we present the first study evaluating the effect of ligand backbone symmetry on multinuclear lanthanide complex self&#8208;assembly. Replacement of a symmetric ethylene linker with an unsymmetric amide at the centre of a homoditopic ligand governs formation of an unusual Ln6L6&#160;complex with coordinatively unsaturated metal centres. The choice of triflate as a counterion, and the effect of ionic radii are shown to be critical for formation of the Ln6L6&#160;complex. The atypical Ln6L6&#160;architecture is characterized using a combination of mass spectrometry, luminescence, DOSY NMR and EPR spectroscopy measurements. Luminescence experiments support clear differences between comparable Eu6L6&#160;and Eu2L3&#160;complexes, with relatively short luminescent lifetimes and low quantum yields observed for the Eu6L6&#160;structure indicative of non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Synthesis of the Gd6L6analogue allows three distinct Gd&#183;&#183;&#183;Gd distance measurements to be extracted using homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern Potentiometric Biosensing Based on Non&#8208;equilibrium Measurement Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membrane ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) have achieved new breakthroughs in sensitivity, selectivity, and stability and extended applications in environmental surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial analysis. Moreover, nonclassical potentiometry shows promise for many applications and opens up new opportunities for potentiometric biosensing. Here, we aim to provide a concept to summarize advances over the past decade in the development of potentiometric biosensors with polymeric membrane ISEs. This concept articulates sensing mechanisms based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques. In particular, we emphasize new trends in potentiometric biosensing based on attractive dynamic approaches. Representative examples are selected to illustrate key applications under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes. More importantly, fruitful information obtained from non&#8208;equilibrium measurements with dynamic responses can be useful for artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of ISEs with advanced AI techniques for effective data processing is also discussed. We hope that the concept will illustrate the great possibilities offered by non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques and AI in potentiometric biosensing and encourage further innovations in this exciting field.</dc:description>

         <title>Isocyanides as Catalytic Electron Acceptors in the Visible Light Promoted Oxidative Formation of Benzyl and Acyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic isocyanides are able to harvest visible light and promote the oxidative formation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations provide key data for mechanistic insights. Furthermore, a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds is reported.







Abstract
The recent disclosure of the ability of aromatic isocyanides to harvest visible light and act as single electron acceptors when reacting with tertiary aromatic amines has triggered a renewed interest in their application to the development of green photoredox catalytic methodologies. Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground&#8208;state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground&#8208; and the excited&#8208;state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provide key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide&#8208;based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry is demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven, Non&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion of Silicon Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small silacycles were obtained by small molecule activation with a bromosilylene. The silacycles were treated with isonitriles to induce ring expansion reactions. The saturated rings showed two subsequent isomerisation reactions.







Abstract
Silacycles are ubiquitous building blocks. Small silacycles can typically be expanded catalytically. A silirane, silirene and phosphasilirene as well as a siletane and a silolene were prepared starting from the base&#8208;free bromosilylene [(dtbpCbz)SiBr] (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). As these heterocycles were derived from a dicoordinated silylene, they are susceptible to reactions with an external base. The three&#8208;membered silacycles readily undergo non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion reactions with isonitriles yielding the related four&#8208;membered silacycles. Surprisingly, the ring&#8208;expanded derivatives of the silirane undergo up to two further isomerisation reactions, first by enamine formation and then by another ring expansion. DFT computations were utilised to gauge the scope of this reactivity pattern. Three&#8208;membered silacycles should essentially universally undergo a ring expansion with isonitriles, while for four&#8208;membered silacycles, only very few instances are predicted to accommodate more challenging kinetic requirements of this ring expansion. Larger silacycles lack the ring strain energy required for this ring expansion reaction and are not expected to be expanded.

The dehydropolymerization of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 using bis(imino)pyridine rhodium pre&#8208;catalysis reveals the &#963;&#8208;amine&#8722;borane complexes, nanoparticle formation, and polyaminoboranes with low residual metal content that can be chemically repurposed to N,N,N&#8208;trimethylcyclotriborazane.







Abstract
The sigma amine&#8722;borane complexes [Rh(L1)(&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;H3B&#8901;NRH2)][OTf] (L1=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine, R=Me, Et, nPr) are described, alongside [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf]. Using R=Me as a pre&#8208;catalyst (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 gives [H2BNMeH]n selectively. Added NMeH2, or the direct use of [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf], is required for initiation of catalysis, which is suggested to operate through the formation of a neutral hydride complex, Rh(L1)H. The formation of small (1&#8211;5&#8197;nm) nanoparticles is observed at the end of catalysis, but studies are ambiguous as to whether the catalysis is solely nanoparticle promoted or if there is a molecular homogeneous component. [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf] is shown to operate at 0.025&#8197;mol&#8201;% loadings on a 2&#8197;g scale of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 to give polyaminoborane [H2BNMeH]n [Mn=30,900&#8197;g/mol, &#208;=1.8] that can be purified to a low residual [Rh] (6&#8197;&#956;g/g). Addition of Na[N(SiMe3)2] to [H2BNMeH]n results in selective depolymerization to form the eee&#8208;isomer of N,N,N&#8208;trimethylcyclotriborazane [H2BNMeH]3: the chemical repurposing of a main&#8208;group polymer.

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99:1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesised from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalysed ring opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scaleable.</dc:description>

Magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the phenoxo&#8208;hydrazone scaffolded lanthanide dimers lead to first example of trityl&#8208;governed zero field Ln&#8208;SMMs







Abstract
The triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Trityl&#8208;appended mono&#8208; (HL1) and bis&#8208;compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1&#8211;4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1&#8211;6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1&#8211;4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotropic axes and corroborated magnetic relaxation mechanisms to be a combination of Raman and quantum tunnelling in zero dc field, the latter being cancelled in the optimum non&#8208;zero dc field. Our work represents the first study of magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the trityl Ln&#8208;SMMs, leading to generation of slowly relaxing zero&#8208;field dysprosium complexes within the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies.

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;Droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;Induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for labeling cells with microdroplet identifiers generated from a set of DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads is demonstrated. By employing a combinatorial approach, in which combinations of DNA barcodes from randomly encapsulated multiple DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads collectively serve as unique molecular identifiers, generating many unique identifiers becomes feasible. In microdroplets, DNA barcoding molecules released from microbeads tag cell membranes, which are then read by single&#8208;cell sequencing.







Abstract
A microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8211;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Herein, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serve as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community in silico in the single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and displaying 6 or 12&#8197;monofluorocyclooctyne units grafted onto their surface allowed the design of deoxynojirimycin clusters by copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry ligation. The dendrimers proved to be potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors and behave as pharmacological chaperones in Gaucher disease cells. These dendrimers functionalized by monofluorocyclooctynes units may find numerous applications to prepare multivalent objects for biological purposes.







Abstract
The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8208;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes whose inner surfaces were selectively oxidized work well as a nano&#8208;container for concentrated DNA molecules. The Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction is exerted between DNA phosphate groups and the carboxylate anions formed on the inner carbon surface and the interaction attracts DNA molecules to the inner space so as to make the total net charge of DNA equal to the charge of the carboxylate anions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35&#8197;nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.

         <title>Fluorinated Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;Porphyrin with Redox&#8208;Responsive 1H and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported that is capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and a 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.







Abstract
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The physical&#8208;chemical characterization of both redox states in DMSO&#8208;d6/H2O evidenced that the 1H relaxometric and 19F&#8197;NMR properties are appropriate for differential redox MRI detection. The Mn(III)&#8208;F distance (dMn&#8722;F=9.7&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;), as assessed by DFT calculations, is well tailored to allow for adequate paramagnetic effect of Mn(III) on 19F T1 and T2 relaxation times. Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 has a reversible Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox potential of 0.574&#8197;V vs. NHE in deoxygenated aqueous HEPES/ THF solution. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly, but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. The broad 1H and 19F&#8197;NMR signals of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 disappear in the presence of 1&#8197;equivalent ascorbate replaced by a shifted and broadened 19F&#8197;NMR signal from Mn(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.

The reduction of Mn(III)-TPP-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly, but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV-Vis spectrometry and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR. The broad &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR signals of Mn(III)-TPP-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; disappear in the presence of 1&#8197;equivalent ascorbate replaced by a shifted and broadened &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR signal from Mn(II)-TPP-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Addition of zinc hydride to the germanium(II) center results in zincagermanes with H&#8722;Zn&#8722;Ge&#8722;H core, which react with CO2 to give a digermylene and zinc formate.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (TMEDA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), zinc dihydride reacted with germanium(II) compounds (BDI&#8722;H)Ge (1) and [(BDI)Ge][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (3) (BDI&#8208;H = HC{(C=CH2)(CMe)(NAr)2}, BDI = [HC(CMeNAr)2]; Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) by formal insertion of the germanium(II) center into the Zn&#8722;H bond of polymeric [ZnH2]n to give neutral and cationic zincagermane with a H&#8722;Ge&#8208;Zn&#8722;H core [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (2) and [(BDI)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (4), respectively. Compound 2 eliminated [ZnH2] giving diamido germylene 1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Compound 2 and deuterated analogue 2&#8208;d2 exchanged with [ZnH2]n and [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA to give a mixture of 2 and 2&#8208;d2. Compounds 2 and 4 reacted with carbon dioxide (1&#8197;bar) at room temperature to form zincagermane diformate [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(OCHO)&#8208;(OCHO)Zn(tmeda)] (5) and formate bridged digermylene [({BDI}Ge)2(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)]+[B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (6) along with zinc formate [(tmeda)Zn(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)3Zn(tmeda)][B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (7), respectively. The hydridic nature of the Ge&#8722;H and Zn&#8722;H bonds in 2 and 4 was probed by reactions with Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acids.

High valent MnV=O at room temperature: This works highlights the identification and characterization of a transient MnV=O species with the help of an in&#8197;situ generated anionic moiety. The oxidative species are mapped to trigger intracellular redox modulation to prevent cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (mCPBA = m&#8208;Chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative MnV=O species at RT. The proposed MnV=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.

         <title>Photoactivation of Solid&#8208;State Fluorescence through Controllable Intermolecular [2+2] Photodimerization</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient photoactivation behavior of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence of a variety of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide derivatives luminogens is achieved based on a controllable self&#8208;assembly and efficient intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction, which provides a simple and effective pathway to construct smart photoresponsive materials and fresh AIEgens with excellent photostability in purely through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
Intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization provides a distinctive approach to construct photoresponsive fluorescent materials in a manner of switching on solid&#8208;state fluorescence. Herein, we report efficient photoactivation of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence based on controllable intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide (BTO) derivatives, which provides a simple and effective way to construct smart photoresponsive solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials. Rational choice of substituents in BTO molecular skeleton enables them to efficiently undergo photodimerization through regulating molecular stacking in crystal, and also leads to photoactivation of solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to the generation of brightly fluorescent photodimers. This intermolecular photodimerization reaction also offers an effective method to synthesize photostable AIEgens with purely through&#8208;space conjugation.

By the combination of an Ugi&#8208;4CR and a transition metal&#8208;free selective N&#8722;S bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond activation, diverse primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides were simultaneously obtained in a highly efficient, rapid, and step&#8208;economical manner. The reaction features broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and exclusive selectivity. Primary amides derived from the pharmaceuticals probenecid and febuxostat are also prepared.







Abstract
A novel method of transition metal&#8208;free N&#8722;S bond cleavage and subsequent C&#8722;N bond activation of Ugi&#8208;adducts was developed. Diverse primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides were prepared in a rapid, step&#8208;economical and highly efficient manner in two steps. This strategy features excellent chemoselectivity, high yield and functional&#8208;group tolerance. Primary amides derived from the pharmaceuticals probenecid and febuxostat were prepared. This method opens a new pathway for the simultaneous synthesis of primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in an environmentally friendly manner.

         <title>Superhydrophilic and Superaerophobic Ru&#8208;Loaded NiCo Bimetallic Hydroxide Achieves Efficient Hydrogen Evolution over All pH Ranges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile and effective strategy to synthesize Ru NPs anchored on NiCo&#8208;BH by spontaneous redox reactions as high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalysts at all pH values. The Ru&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) interfacial bond between Ru nanoparticles and Ni&#8722;Co is beneficial to mass transfer in HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68 and 80&#8197;mV, a 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively.







Abstract
Realizing an effective, binder&#8208;free, and super&#8208;wetting electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at full pH is essential for the creation of clean hydrogen. In this study, the Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide (Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH) catalyst was prepared by spontaneous redox reaction. The chemical interaction between Ru NPs and NiCo&#8208;BH by the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) interface bond, the electron&#8208;rich Ru active site, and the multi&#8208;channel nickel foam carrier make the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface advantageous for mass transfer in the HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68 and 80&#8197;mV, a 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes respectively. This work provides a reference for the rational development of universal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in the all pH ranges through simple design strategies.

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Excitation Induced Electron Transfer in Bis Donor&#8208;AzaBODIPY Push&#8208;Pull Systems; Role of Nitrogenous Donors in Promoting Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor constructs featuring azaBODIPY and nitrogenous donors have been newly designed, synthesized and characterized using a range of physico&#8208;chemical techniques. Excited state charge transfer and separation, as a function of solvent polarity, is demonstrated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
A far&#8208;red absorbing sensitizer, BF2&#8208;chelated azadipyrromethane (azaBODIPY) has been employed as an electron acceptor to synthesize a series of push&#8208;pull systems linked with different nitrogenous electron donors, viz., N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NND), triphenylamine (TPA), and phenothiazine (PTZ) via an acetylene linker. The structural integrity of the newly synthesized push&#8208;pull systems was established by spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and DFT computational methods. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry studies revealed different redox states and helped in the estimation of the energies of the charge&#8208;separated states. Further, spectroelectrochemical studies performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell revealed diagnostic peaks of azaBODIPY&#8901;&#8722; in the visible and near&#8208;IR regions. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed the charge separation from one of the covalently linked donors to the 1azaBODIPY* to yield Donor&#8901;+&#8208;azaBODIPY&#8901;&#8722; to be energetically favorable in a polar solvent, benzonitrile, and the frontier orbitals generated on the optimized structures helped in assessing such a conclusion. Consequently, the steady&#8208;state emission studies revealed quenching of the azaBODIPY fluorescence in all of the investigated push&#8208;pull systems in benzonitrile and to a lesser extent in mildly polar dichlorobenzene, and nonpolar toluene. The femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies revealed the occurrence of excited charge transfer (CT) in nonpolar toluene while a complete charge separation (CS) for all three push&#8208;pull systems in polar benzonitrile. The CT/CS products populated the low&#8208;lying 3azaBODIPY* prior to returning to the ground state. Global target (GloTarAn) analysis of the transient data revealed the lifetime of the final charge&#8208;separated states (CSS) to be 195&#8197;ps for NND&#8208;derived, 50&#8197;ps for TPA&#8208;derived, and 85&#8197;ps for PTZ&#8208;derived push&#8208;pull systems in benzonitrile.

         <title>Diastereoselective Petasis&#8208;Borono&#8208;Mannich Crotylation Reactions of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Heteroatom (F, OBz, OH) Aldehydes: Rapid Access to Valuable Mono and Bicyclic Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scope of the Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich reaction has been expanded to include crotylboronates as a variation of boronic ester. These have been examined in reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;heteroatom (F, OBz, OH) aldehydes and primary amines, to produce enantioenriched compounds up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 er. Examples have been converted to heterocyclic scaffolds with proof of absolute configuration.







Abstract
The crotylation reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;F, &#945;&#8208;OBz and &#945;&#8208;OH aldehydes under Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich conditions using (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;crotylboronates and primary amines resulted in &#947;&#8208;addition products in high dr and high er. &#945;&#8208;F and &#945;&#8208;OBz aldehydes gave 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn and 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;anti, products, respectively while an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde gave 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn products. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions of the former aldehydes can be explained using a six&#8208;membered ring transition state (TS) model in which a Cornforth&#8208;like conformation around the imine intermediate is favoured resulting in 1,2&#8208;anti products. The 2,3&#8208;stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open&#8208;TS involving H&#8208;bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;&#8208;OH group and the imine N atom. Representative products were converted to highly functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridines and 3H&#8208;oxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;ones which will be valuable scaffolds in synthesis.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of ABCD&#8208;Porphyrin Platinum(II) Complexes via Dehydrative Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes synthesis of ABCD&#8208;porphryin Pt(II) complexes via dehydrative aromatization in one&#8208;pot from corresponding dipyrrinatoPt(II) complexes and bisformyldipyrrins. This procedure also enables the construction of a C1&#8208;symmetrical ABCD&#8208;porphyrin with intrinsic chirality from achiral precursors. The photophysical properties of obtained molecules are also described in detail.







Abstract
Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization. Herein, we present a synthetic method to produce ABCD&#8208;porphyrins, including chiral ones, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving &#8220;coordination, cyclization, and dehydrative aromatization&#8221; using a mono&#8208;dipyrrinatoPt(II)Cl(COE) (COE=cyclooctene) complex as a platinum template.

Functionalized triose&#8208;, furanose and chromane&#8208;derivatives were synthesized by the titled reactions. The C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming cascade processes generate a functionalized sugar derivative with a quaternary stereocenter in a highly enantioselective fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) by using a simple combination of metal and chiral amine co&#8208;catalysts. Notably, the interplay between the chiral sugar substrate and the chiral amino acid derivative allowed for the construction of a functionalized sugar product with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) also when using a combination of racemic amine catalyst (0&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and metal catalyst.

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular copolymerization of chiral comonomers into helical assemblies can introduce competing polymerization pathways. Temperature can be used to control the composition of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based copolymers and thereby invert the helical screw&#8208;sense of the assemblies. By combining spectroscopy with computations, the authors show that the temperature&#8208;dependent helical structure originates from the copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.

         <title>Efficient Nitric Oxide Scavenging by Urea&#8208;Functionalized Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Modulates NO&#8208;Mediated Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The harmful effects of excess nitric oxide (NO) can be prevented by its scavenging. We show that a urea&#8208;functionalized molecule (Urea&#8208;eTCBD), rapidly binds to NO and forms a stable NONOate. The inhibition of NO&#8208;mediated, paw inflammation and corneal neovascularization by Urea&#8208;eTCBD, confirmed the biocompatibility and efficacy of the molecule. Additionally, Urea&#8208;eTCBD exhibited its potential for NO&#8208;sensing through a fluorescence turn&#8208;off mechanism.







Abstract
The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) were developed as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in&#8197;vitro, as a NO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.

Silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides afforded the corresponding p&#8208;sulfenylanilides in good to high yields with good para selectivity. The transformation has a high compatibility of functional groups, such as ester, bromo, and iodo groups. Mechanistic studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction proceeds through intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.

Abstract
A general pathway towards NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)&#8208;stabilized galliummonotriflates NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GaH2(OTf) (NHC=IDipp, 1&#8201;a; IPr2Me2, 1&#8201;b; IMes, 1&#8201;c; IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IPr2Me2=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(diisopropyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) is reported. Quantum chemical calculations give detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathway. The obtained NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GaH2(OTf) compounds were employed in reactions with donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes to synthesize the elusive cationic parent 13/15/13 chain compounds [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GaH2ER2E'H2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;D][OTf] (3&#8201;a: D=IDipp, E=P, E&#8217;=B, R=H; 3&#8201;b: D=NMe3, E=P, E&#8217;=B, R=H, 3&#8201;c: D=NMe3, E=P, E&#8217;=B, R=Ph, 3&#8201;d: D=IDipp, E=P, E&#8217;=Ga, R=H).

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;to&#8208;air, room&#8208;temperature RAFT polymerization procedure is employed in an automated platform to produce unprecedented complex macromolecular structures unobtainable manually. The precise structures made using this machine pave the way for the next generation of material design, harnessing large databases accessible using such automated material manufacturing.







Abstract
Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. This work combines an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. The highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system is reported, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>

Cards for improvement. Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were synthesized and found to display improved reactivity compared to the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. The stability and catalytic performance were generally improved by deuteration, though the improvement was structure dependent. In particular, an unexpectedly large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated catalyst.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.

Incorporating deuteriums into the correct positions of organocatalysts increases their stability and robustness, just like the story of &#8220;The Three Little Pigs&#8221;: the first two pigs hastily construct houses made of straw and sticks (non&#8208;deuterated and dideuterated catalysts), but they were quickly destroyed by the wolf&#8242;s huffing and puffing (OH&#8722;). In contrast, the third pig took time to build a sturdy house made of bricks (tetradeuterated catalyst), and the brick house remained intact. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Liu, H.&#8197;Naka, K.&#8197;Maruoka and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301866).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) can be prepared by a CVD technique using the straight and uniform nanochannels of an anodic aluminium oxide film as a template (top left). The CNTTs are readily dispersed in water. Importantly, a significant number of DNA molecules are specifically attracted to the inner space of CNTTs (bottom left). This is due to the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA and the inner carbon surface. The numerous small yellow spheres in the cover represent Ca2+ cations. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Kyotani, T. Itoh, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301422).

         <title>Quantifying Catalysis at the Origin of Life
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origin of life theories often invoke catalytic mechanisms, but catalysis of biologically relevant reactions in geologically plausible scenarios has been until recently experimentally elusive. In this perspective, we suggest that researchers move toward decreased catalyst loading, increased yields, as well as before/after characterization of metals or minerals to demonstrate true catalysis.







Abstract
The construction of hypothetical environments to produce organic molecules such as metabolic intermediates or amino acids is the subject of ongoing research into the emergence of life. Experiments specifically focused on an anabolic approach typically rely on a mineral catalyst to facilitate the supply of organics that may have produced prebiotic building blocks for life. Alternatively to a true catalytic system, a mineral could be sacrificially oxidized in the production of organics, necessitating the emergent &#8216;life&#8217; to turn to virgin materials for each iteration of metabolic processes. The aim of this perspective is to view the current &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; literature through the lens of materials chemistry to evaluate the need for higher catalytic activity and materials analyses. While many elegant studies have detailed the production of chemical building blocks under geologically plausible and biologically relevant conditions, few appear to do so with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metals or minerals. Moving toward sub&#8208;stoichiometric metals with rigorous materials analyses is necessary to demonstrate the viability of an elusive cornerstone of the &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; hypotheses: catalysis. We emphasize that future work should aim to demonstrate decreased catalyst loading, increased productivity, and/or rigorous materials analyses for evidence of true catalysis.

Graphdiyne, as a novel type of carbon allostrope, possessing both a planar conjugated structure and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. This review summarized various synthesis and modification methods of the GDY&#8208;based materials and their recent advances in energy storage are reviewed, including applications mainly in Li&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices, and the perspectives of the challenges and opportunities faced by GDY&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Graphynes (GYs) are a novel type of carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, boasting both a planar conjugated structure akin to graphene and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. Graphdiyne (GDY), the first successfully synthesized member of GYs family, has gained much interest due to its fascinating electrochemical properties including a greater theoretical capacity, high charge mobility and advanced electronic transport properties, making it a promising material for energy storage applications for lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage. Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large&#8208;scale commercial application of GDY&#8208;based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.

         <title>Cryogenic Ion Fluorescence Spectroscopy: FRET in Rhodamine Homodimers and Heterodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase FRET going cold: Photoexcitation of a rhodamine dye (the donor) in a homo&#8208; or heterodimer composed of two dyes separated by a short alkyl spacer leads to resonant energy transfer (RET) from the donor to the acceptor dye that has a lower excited&#8208;state energy. To selective excite one dye in a homodimer of two chemically identical dyes, experiments were done at cryogenic temperatures to resolve individual absorption bands.







Abstract
The internal electronic communication between two or more light&#8208;absorbers is fundamental for energy&#8208;transport processes, a field of large current interest. Here the intrinsic photophysics of homo&#8208; and heterodimers of rhodamine cations were studied where just two methylene units bridge the dyes. Gas&#8208;phase experiments were done on frozen molecular ions at cryogenic temperatures using the newly built LUNA2 mass spectroscopy setup in Aarhus. Both absorption (from fluorescence excitation) and dispersed&#8208;fluorescence spectra were measured. In the gas phase, there is no dielectric screening from solvent molecules, and the effect of charges on transition energies is maximum. Indeed, bands are redshifted compared to those of monomer dyes due to the electric field that each dye senses from the other in a dimer. Importantly, also, as two chemically identical dyes in a homodimer do not experience the same field along the long axis, each dye has separate absorption. At low temperatures, it is therefore possible to selectively excite one dye. Fluorescence is dominantly from the dye with the lowest transition energy no matter which dye is photoexcited. Hence this work unequivocally demonstrates F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer even in homodimers where one dye acts as donor and the other as acceptor.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Supramolecular 1D Alternating Copolymer in Crystal toward 2D Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D non&#8208;covalent supramolecular copolymer is aligned horizontally with the 2D crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported 2D platelet crystal waveguides.







Abstract
To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one&#8208;dimensional&#8208;ordered supramolecular structures composed of light&#8208;emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, a bipyridyl&#8208;appended acrylonitrile&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule was designed, which produced a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer constructed through non&#8208;covalent bonding between a lone pair in bipyridyl and a &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The one&#8208;dimensional copolymer of bipyridyl and 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene is aligned horizontally with the two&#8208;dimensional crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non&#8208;covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the two&#8208;dimensional surface. Compared with the loss coefficient &#945;L=52&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the long&#8208;axis direction of the two&#8208;dimensional platelet cocrystal, a very large difference of &#945;S=2111&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is present in the crystal short&#8208;axis direction. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported two&#8208;dimensional platelet crystal waveguides. This supramolecular synthon provides an approach to designing anisotropic photon transporters and highly regulated optical logic circuits.

         <title>Single Molecular Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Binaphthol&#8208;Decorated Optically Innocent Cyclotriphosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design strategy based on the dendritic effect results in a single chiral chromophore that emits simultaneous persistent RTP and circularly polarized luminescence. This study suggests that the optical features of these compounds are dominated by the pendent BINOL entity without the participation of the cyclophosphazene dendritic core.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features of BINOL&#8208;decorated cyclotriphosphazenes (CPs) are reported for the first time. The luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of these compounds in chloroform solutions and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin films with wt 1&#8201;% doping concentrations are found to be 1.0&#215;10&#8722;3, and 2.9&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. However, no CPL signal is observed for the pristine solids. The enantiomers (CP&#8208;(R)/CP&#8208;(S)) show ultraviolet photoluminescence (~350&#8211;360&#8197;nm) in solution and the solid state. These compounds show ~10&#8197;times larger absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) than the simple BINOLs in the solutions state. In the solid state, CP&#8208;(R) shows larger PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(R); in contrast, the S enantiomer shows lower PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(S); this indicates that the isomer&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;state packing of these compounds plays a crucial role in controlling the PL. Thin films with more than 1&#8201;% doping concentration and pristine solids of these compounds do not show persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) due to concentration&#8208;caused quenching. However, thin films with wt 1&#8201;% of these chiral emitters exhibit pRTP characteristics with a ~159&#8208;343&#8197;ms lifetime under vacuum. Theoretical calculations reveal that the cyclophosphazene acts as an optically innocent dendritic core, and the optical features of these compounds are dictated by the pendent BINOL chromophore.

         <title>Protein Sequencing with Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Integrated Phosphorene Nanoslit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning integrated phosphorene nanoslit for high throughput protein sequencing based on the transverse tunneling current approach is presented herein. The findings reveal that materials with a puckered geometry outperform planar ones, offering exciting new possibilities for more accurate and efficient protein sequencing.







Abstract
Achieving high throughput protein sequencing at single molecule resolution remains a daunting challenge. Herein, relying on a solid&#8208;state 2D phosphorene nanoslit device, an extraordinary biosensor to rapidly identify the key signatures of all twenty amino acids using an interpretable machine learning (ML) model is reported. The XGBoost regression algorithm allows the determination of the transmission function of all twenty amino acids with high accuracy. The resultant ML and DFT studies reveal that it is possible to identify individual amino acids through transmission and current signals readouts with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, we thoroughly compared our results to those from graphene nanoslit and found that the phosphorene nanoslit device can be an ideal candidate for protein sequencing up to a 20&#8208;fold increase in transmission sensitivity. The present study facilitates high throughput screening of all twenty amino acids and can be further extended to other biomolecules for disease diagnosis and therapeutic decision making.

         <title>Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual nickel and photoredox catalysis enables the semi&#8208;reduction of internal aryl alkynes in the presence of a trialkylamine acting both as a reductive quencher and as a transfer hydrogenation reagent. The E/Z&#8208;stereoselectivity can be controlled with the aid of an alcohol additive.







Abstract
We report a selectivity&#8208;switchable nickel hydride&#8208;catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi&#8208;reduction of internal alkynes to E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo&#8208;induced generation of nickel hydride, syn&#8208;hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post&#8208;reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions.

     alt="Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi-Hydrogenation of Alkynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual nickel and photoredox catalysis&lt;/b&gt; enables the semi-reduction of internal aryl alkynes in the presence of a trialkylamine acting both as a reductive quencher and as a transfer hydrogenation reagent. The &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt;-stereoselectivity can be controlled with the aid of an alcohol additive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a selectivity-switchable nickel hydride-catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi-reduction of internal alkynes to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi-hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo-induced generation of nickel hydride, &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post-reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions. Instead, we demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the reaction is dependent on the rate of a final protonolysis step which can be tuned by adjusting the pKa of an alcohol additive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Guanidine&#8208;Supported &#960;&#8208;Complex of Germanium Amenable to Intramolecular C&#8208;C Cleavage in Arene and Ge Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R = SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge (NHI= N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R= SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8208;Tol)Ge (R= p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge to 70 &#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8208;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8208;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8208;Tol)NGe]n.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Carbodicarbene Class by Embedding an Anionic Component in its Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbodicarbene (CDC) has become an emerging ligand in many fields due to their strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability. We report the synthesis of the first anionic CDC pincer Pd complexes containing a BF2 moiety within the framework, a charge&#8208;frustration zwitterion approach to leverage the electronic feature of carbon(0)/carbone, which is unprecedented. The elucidation of X&#8208;ray crystal structures, ligand competition as well as transmetallation experiments suggest that the anionic moiety has enhanced the overall donor strength of the traditional neutral CDC. Importantly, this anionic scaffold exhibits a facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance, whereas previously reported neutral pincer CDC complexes do not possess a two&#8208;fold donor capacity. The analysis of the bonding situation via theoretical methods shows that the description of the anionic CDC moieties in terms of dative bonding is preferred over the model of delocalized positive charge, as it accounts for the two&#8208;fold donor ability of the divalent carbon atom, preserving characteristic feature of a carbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Dimethyl Stellane&#8208;1,5&#8208;Dicarboxylate&#160;as a Key Precursor for the ortho&#8208;Benzene Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present previously unavailable C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds which have a potential to become valuable tools in medicinal chemistry and crop science as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids. We have developed a scalable protocol (up to 50 g from a single synthetic run) for the synthesis of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (bisnoradamantane or stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has revealed that this scaffold is an optimal saturated isostere for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene where substituents exhibit the in&#8208;plane topology. The synthetic protocol is based on the oxidative cyclization of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (DMOD) through lithiation followed by I2 oxidation. The reaction outcome is determined by the stereochemistry of the substrate. While the endo,endo cis&#8208;DMOD,&#160; exclusively gives the "unwanted" Claisen cyclization product the exo,endo cis&#8208; and exo,exo cis&#8208; stereoisomers afford the desired stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester quantitatively. DFT computations have revealed that the reaction proceeds via the dianion of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, which undergoes SET oxidation by I2 to form a radical anion. The subsequent cyclization followed by a second SET oxidation gives desired stellane derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Methoxylation Promoted CPET Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manuscript discloses a methoxylation reaction to an aromatic carbonyl function that carries out a CPET reaction oxidizing a transition metal ion. Spontaneous methoxylation of a redox non&#8208;innocent fragment coordinated to a high spin cobalt(II) ion, promoted concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction oxidizing cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) in air and subsequent demethoxylation induced reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II) producing H2O2 are authenticated. The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is &#8208;0.27 V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple. However, in presence of MeOH the reduction potential decreases to &#8208;1.02 V due to CPET involving MeOH proton. In CH2Cl2/CHCl3 spontaneous demethoxylation occurs giving back the original complex and reactive methoxyl radical that reacts with O2 producing H2O2. Overall one molecule of MeOH produces one molecule of H2O2. To analyze the involvement of the proton, the rate constants of the CPET reactions in CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (2:1) and CH2Cl2&#8208;CD3OD (2:1) and the demethoxylation reaction in CHCl3 at 330 K were determined by time drive UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium and Iron Co&#8208;doped Molybdenum Carbide as a Stable Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Harsh Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most commercially valuable pathways of hydrogen production especially combined with renewable electricity; however, efficient and durable electrocatalysts are urgently needed to reduce electric energy consumption. Here, we reported a Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C on nitrogen doped carbon via a controllable two&#8208;step method, which can be used for efficient and enduring hydrogen evolution reaction. At 10, 100 and 200 mA cm&#8208;2 in acidic electrolyte, the resultant Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC delivered low overpotentials of 31, 78 and 103 mV, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). At an applied current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, stable hydrogen production was conducted for 120 h without obvious degradation. In alkaline media, Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC can also deliver a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 for more than 100 h. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC electrocatalyst was used as cathode in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer under industrial environments for robust hydrogen production. The characterization and electrochemical results prove the synergism effects between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C for promoting hydrogen evolution activity. This work would pave a new avenue to fabricate low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for industrial water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Germylenes Exhibiting Solid&#8208;State Emissions that Extend to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state photoluminescence of low&#8208;valent main group element compounds is investigated for the first time using stable germylene carboxylates. Apart from showing room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence, these carboxylates exhibited significant differences in their solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state emissions.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group compounds that fluoresce in the solid&#8208;state were previously unknown. To address this, we investigated room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence from a series of crystals of germylenes 3&#8211;8 in this article; they exhibited emissions nearly reaching the NIR. Germylene carboxylates (3&#8211;8) were synthesized by reacting dipyrromethene stabilized germylene pyrrolide (2) with carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, p&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, and acetylsalicylic acid.

         <title>Elucidation of Substituent&#8208;Responsive Reactivities via Hierarchical and Asymmetric Assemblies in Crystalline p&#8208;Quinodimethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups in the crystals were elucidated by analyzing crystal structures through their hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, 1D&#8208;columns, 2D&#8208;sheets, and 3D&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals) and intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with DFT calculations.







Abstract
We propose a mechanism for substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups through their hierarchical and asymmetric assembly modes. Four asymmetric 7,8,8&#8208;tris(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes with a 7&#8208;positioned ethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;a(H)), 2&#8217;&#8208;fluoroethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;b(F)), 2&#8217;&#8208;chloroethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;c(Cl)), or 2&#8217;&#8208;bromoethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;d(Br)) were synthesized and crystallized. 2&#8201;a(H), 2&#8201;b(F) and 2&#8201;d(Br) afforded only one shape crystal, while 2&#8201;c(Cl) did two polymorphic 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#945; and 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#946;. UV&#8208;irradiation induced topochemical polymerization for 2&#8201;a(H), no reactions for 2&#8201;b(F) and 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#945;, and [6+6] photocycloaddition dimerization for 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#946; and 2&#8201;d(Br). Such substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities and crystal structures were compared with those of the known symmetric 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes such as 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;a(Me)&#8208;&#945; and 1&#8201;a(Me)&#8208;&#946;), 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;b(Et)), and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(bromoethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;c(BrEt)). The comparative study clarified that the reactivities and crystal structures are classified into four types that link to each other. This linkage is understandable when we analyze the crystal structures through the following hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, one dimensional (1D)&#8208;columns, two dimensional (2D)&#8208;sheets, and three dimensional (3D)&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals). This supramolecular viewpoint is supported by intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Such research enables us to elucidate the substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of the crystals, and reminds us of the selection of the right path in a so&#8208;called &#8220;maze game&#8221;.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Aided NO2 Discrimination with an Array of Graphene Chemiresistors Covalently Functionalized by Diazonium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nosey, NO2sey! An e&#8208;nose based on graphene chemiresistors, covalently functionalized by exploiting diazonium chemistry, has been developed to detect and discriminate nitrogen dioxide for environmental and medical applications.







Abstract
Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystems, electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalized with one of three different aryl rings: 4&#8208;nitrophenyl, 4&#8208;carboxyphenyl and 4&#8208;bromophenyl. The distinct modified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e&#8208;nose for NO2 discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO2 was demonstrated through exposure to gaseous solutions with NO2 concentrations in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array was tested by carrying out exposure to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis showed that the e&#8208;nose can discriminate NO2 among all the interfering gases in a two&#8208;dimensional principal component analysis space. Finally, the e&#8208;nose was trained to accurately recognize NO2 contributions with a linear discriminant analysis approach, thus providing a metric for discrimination assessment with a prediction accuracy above 95&#8201;%.

         <title>Advances in RNA Labeling with Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic RNA with novel fluorine labeling patterns is presented. The study completes the set of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases and enables advanced NMR spectroscopic and cellular applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 group without any RNA sequence restrictions.







Abstract
Fluorine labeling of ribonucleic acids (RNA) in conjunction with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful strategy for spectroscopic analysis of RNA structure and dynamics, and RNA&#8208;ligand interactions. This study presents the first syntheses of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 guanosine and uridine phosphoramidites, their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides by solid&#8208;phase synthesis and a comprehensive study of their properties. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modification is associated with preferential C2&#8242;&#8208;endo conformation of the U and G ribose in single&#8208;stranded RNA. When paired to the complementary strand, slight destabilization of the duplex caused by the modification was revealed by UV melting curve analysis. Moreover, the power of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 label for NMR spectroscopy is demonstrated by dissecting RNA pseudoknot folding and its binding to a small molecule. Furthermore, the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modification has potential for applications in therapeutic oligonucleotides. To this end, three 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modified siRNAs were tested in silencing of the BASP1 gene which indicated enhanced performance for one of them. Importantly, together with earlier work, the present study completes the set of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases (A, U, C, G) and hence enables applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 group without any restrictions in placing the modification into the RNA target sequence.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogs of Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of 17 diisopropyl &#945;&#8208;oxophosphonates was accomplished by using a commercially available Noyori&#8208;type catalyst. The highly enantioenriched products (ee &gt;98&#8201;% in all cases but one) were further converted to the phosphonic acid analogs of 15 aminocarboxylic acids. The established method can also be used for the asymmetric transfer deuteration (ATD) of the starting &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminophosphonic acids have a remarkably broad bioactivity spectrum. They can function as highly efficient transition state mimics for a variety of hydrolytic and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzymes, which makes them interesting target structures for synthetic chemists. In particular, the phosphonic acid analogs to &#945;&#8208;aminocarboxylic acids (PaAAs) are potent enzyme inhibitors, but many of them are only available by chiral or enzymatic resolution; sometimes only one enantiomer is accessible, and several have never been prepared in enantiopure form at all. Today, a variety of methods to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids is known but none of the reported approaches can be generally applied for the synthesis of PaAAs. Here we show that the phosphonic acid analogs of many (proteinogenic) &#945;&#8208;amino acids become accessible by the catalytic, stereoselective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates. The highly enantioenriched (enantiomeric excess (ee) &#8805; 98&#8201;%) &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates obtained are important pharmaceutical building blocks in themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogs became easily accessible from the same &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates using deuterated formic acid (DCO2H).

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was developed with group&#8197;13 elements, B, Al, and Ga. The ligand enabled the stabilization of geometrically strained boron cationic species.







Abstract
A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group&#8197;13 elements, B, Al, and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8722;B&#8722;C angle of 140&#176;. Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted LnDOTA Chelates from Achiral Starting Materials by Deracemization Under Mild Conditions
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;substituted DOTA chelates can be prepared from racemic and achiral starting materials. The mixture of stereoisomeric ligands produced deracemizes, under mild conditions, to a single diastereoisomeric chelate with the introduction of the metal ion.







Abstract
Substituted derivatives of the DOTA framework are of general interest to alter chelate properties and facilitate the conjugation of chelates to other molecular structures. However, the scope of substituents that can be introduced into the &#945;&#8208;position has traditionally been limited by the availability of a suitable enantiopure starting materials to facilitate a stereoselective synthesis. Tetra&#8208;substituted DOTA derivatives with phenyl and benzoate substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position have been prepared. Initial syntheses used enantiopure starting materials but did not afford enantiopure products. This indicates that the integrity of the stereocenters was not preserved during synthesis, despite the homo&#8208;chiral diastereoisomer being the major reaction product. The homochiral diastereoisomer could be produced as the major or sole reaction product when starting from racemic or even achiral materials. Deracemization was found to occur during chelation through the formation of an enolate stabilized by the aryl substituent. This general ability of aryl groups to enable deracemization greatly increases the range of substituents that can be introduced into DOTA&#8208;type ligands with diastereochemical selectivity.

Mixed&#8208;metal oxo&#8208;alkoxide clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (M=Co, Zn) containing a lacunary double cubane oxometallic core incorporating diethanolamine ligands in unusual bonding modes have been prepared and fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab initio computational methods, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis.







Abstract
Organofunctionalized tetranuclear clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (1, M=Co, 2: M=Zn) containing an unprecedented oxometallacyclic {M2V2Cl2N4O8} (M=Co, Zn) framework have been prepared by solvothermal reactions. The new oxo&#8208;alkoxide compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab initio computational methods, and complete single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis. The isostructural clusters are formed of edge&#8208;sharing octahedral {VO5N} and trigonal bipyramidal {MO3NCl} units. Diethanolamine ligates the bimetallic lacunary double cubane core of 1 and 2 in an unusual two&#8208;mode fashion, unobserved previously. In the crystalline state, the clusters of 1 and 2 are joined by hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional network structure. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate weakly antiferromagnetic interactions between the vanadium centers [Jiso(VIV&#8722;VIV)=&#8722;5.4(1); &#8722;3.9(2) cm&#8722;1], and inequivalent antiferromagnetic interactions between the cobalt and vanadium centers [Jiso (VIV&#8722;CoII)=&#8722;12.6 and &#8722;7.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1] contained in 1.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Injection in Graphene: An EPR and Raman Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin injection on graphene. Tyrosine radicals were covalently attached on graphene and graphene oxide. The tyrosine functionalized graphene products showed increased spin concentration, elevated aromaticity, and conductivity.







Abstract
In this article, the enrichment of graphene and graphene oxide with free radicals through their functionalization with tyrosine is studied. In contrast with what is commonly observed in the functionalization of graphene with organic species the addition of tyrosine radicals on to the graphene substrate led to a remarkable increase of the aromatic character as indicated by the spectroscopic data. Similar behaviour was observed for the functionalization of graphene oxide. In addition, a brief analysis of the tyrosine functionalized graphene with EPR spectroscopy showed a remarkable enhancement of the spin density that could be useful in spintronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, the enrichment of graphene and graphene oxide with free radicals through their functionalization with tyrosine is studied. In contrast with what is commonly observed in the functionalization of graphene with organic species the addition of tyrosine radicals on to the graphene substrate led to a remarkable increase of the aromatic character as indicated by the spectroscopic data. Similar behaviour was observed for the functionalization of graphene oxide. In addition, a brief analysis of the tyrosine functionalized graphene with EPR spectroscopy showed a remarkable enhancement of the spin density that could be useful in spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This combination of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane chemistry, with Lewis &#963;&#8208;basic and &#960;&#8208;acidic substrates being bound and reduced at the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction type within this general theme, in which double electron transfer from the diboron unit to the boron&#8208;bound organic substrate is coupled with halide transfer in the other direction. Novel diborylated dienamines are synthesized in this way. The scope of this unprecedented reaction motif and the reaction pathways are elucidated.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the multifarious role of ligand in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus towards investigating the redox properties of ancillary ligand backbones for small molecule activation. Several metal complexes have been reported for electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER), providing valuable mechanistic insights. This process involves efficient coupling of electrons and protons. Redox&#8208;active ligands stipulate internal electron transfer and promote effective orbital overlap between metal and ligand, thereby enabling efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. Understanding such catalytic mechanisms requires thorough spectroscopic and computational analyses. Herein, we summarize recent examples of molecular electrocatalysts based on 3d transition metals that have significantly influenced mechanistic pathways, thus emphasizing the multifaceted role of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Group I Alkoxides and Amylates as Highly Efficient Silicon&#8211;Nitrogen Heterodehydrocoupling Precatalysts for the Synthesis of Aminosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group I alkoxides are highly active precatalysts in the heterodehydrocoupling of silanes and amines to afford aminosilane products. The broadly soluble and commercially available KOtAmyl was utilized as the benchmark precatalyst for this transformation. Challenging substrates such as anilines were found to readily couple primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes in high conversions (&gt; 90%) after only 2 h at 40 &#176;C. Traditionally challenging silanes such as Ph3SiH were also easily coupled to simple primary and secondary amines under mild conditions, with reactivity that rivals many rare earth and transition&#8208;metal catalysts for this transformation. Preliminary evidence suggests the formation of hypercoordinated intermediates, but radicals were detected under catalytic conditions, indicating a mechanism that is rare for Si&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Racemization Unraveled for MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 by means of a Computational Analysis of MoO2(acnac)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octahedral chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 (a&#8209;chel = asymmetric chelate) can rearrange their ligands by four mechanisms known as the Bailar (B), Ray&#8208;Dutt (RD), Conte&#8208;Hippler (CH), and Dhimba&#8208;Muller&#8208;Lammertsma (DML) twists. Racemization involves their interconnections, which were computed for MoO2(acnac)2 (acnac = &#946;&#8208;ketoiminate) using density functional theory at &#969;B97x&#8208;D with the 6&#8208;31G(d,p) and 6&#8208;311G(2d,p) basis sets and LANL2DZ for molybdenum. Racemizing the cis(NN) isomer, being the global energy minimum with trans oriented imine groups, is a three step process (DML&#8208;CH&#8208;DML) that requires 17.4 kcal/mol, while all three cis isomers (cis(NN), cis(NO), and cis(OO)) interconvert at &#8804; 17.9 kcal/mol. The B and RD twists are energetically not competitive and neither are the trans isomers. The interconnection of all enantiomeric minima and transition structures is summarized in a graph that also visualizes valley ridge inflection points for two of the three CH twists. Geometrical features of the minima and twists are given. Lastly, the influence of N&#8208;substitution on the favored racemization pathway is evaluated. The present comprehensive study serves as a template for designing chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 catalysts that may retain their chiral integrity.</dc:description>

A highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole) bearing branched flexible chains that stabilize a room&#8208;temperature columnar hexagonal phase is reported for the first time. With balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility, it has a high extinction coefficient, a small optical band gap and a wide absorption range.







Abstract
A new series of highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole)s bearing branched flexible chains stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase and with balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility is reported for the first time. Only the anti isomer was successfully separated and characterized. These compounds have a high extinction coefficient, small optical band gap and wide absorption range, thus making them a promising class of ambipolar organic semiconductors capable of self&#8208;organizing.

         <title>Chemical Tailoring of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Adsorption from Drinking Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by amino&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;CD) through different sized alkyl linkers (Cn) is presented. The adsorption properties of GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD materials toward perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS, is studied by combined experimental tests and molecular dynamic simulations allowing deep understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and the adsorption performance.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from drinking water. &#946;CD were functionalized with a pending amino group, and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#946;CD units in the range 12&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% was estimated by combined XPS and elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency, with the hexyl linker derivative GO&#8208;C6&#8208;&#946;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamic simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules retention.

The adsorption properties of GO-C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-&#946;CD materials toward perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS, is studied by combined experimental tests and molecular dynamic simulations allowing deep understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and the adsorption performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the synthesis of &#946;-cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO-C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-&#946;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from drinking water. &#946;CD were functionalized with a pending amino group, and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#946;CD units in the range 12&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% was estimated by combined XPS and elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency, with the hexyl linker derivative GO-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-&#946;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamic simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules retention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra by Using Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I)&#8208;catalysed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click chemistry is a versatile post&#8208;synthetic tool to functionalize the surface chemistry of alkyne&#8208;functionalized cuboctahedral Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs). This methodology enables quantitative functionalization of MOPs with a wide range of functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids and biomolecules.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. This study describes the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24 available surface alkyne groups was synthesised. Each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of the &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can react with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. The wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry was exploited to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.

         <dc:description>Ring translocation switches and shuttles featuring a macrocycle (or a ring molecule) navigating between two or more stations continue to attract attention. While the vast majority of these systems are developed in organic solvents, the cucurbituril (CB) macrocycles are ideally suited to prepare such systems in water.

In this concept article, we summarize the findings, key advances and multiple possibilities offered by CBs toward advanced molecular switches and shuttles in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great success of the concept of doping organic compounds with BN units to access new materials with tailored prop&#173;erties, its use in polymer chemistry has only been realized quite re&#173;cently. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of oligo&#8208; and poly&#173;(arylene iminoborane)s comprising a back&#173;bone of phenylene or thio&#173;phene moieties, as well as combinations thereof, linked via B=N units. The novel polymers can be regarded as BN analogues of poly&#173;(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) or poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) or their copolymers, respectively. Our modular syn&#173;thetic approach al&#173;lowed us to prepare four polymers and twelve monodisperse oligo&#173;mers with modulated electronic properties. Alter&#173;nating electron&#8208;re&#173;leasing di&#173;aminoarylene and electron&#8208;accepting dibo&#173;rylarylene building blocks give rise to a pronounced donor&#8211;acceptor character. Effective &#960;&#8208;con&#173;ju&#173;ga&#173;tion over the arylene iminoborane back&#173;bone is evidenced by sys&#173;tematic bathochromic shifts of the low&#8208;energy UV&#8208;vis absorp&#173;tion max&#173;imum with increasing chain length, which is furthermore sup&#173;ported by crystallographic and compu&#173;tational investigations. Further&#173;more, all compounds investigated show emission of visible light in the solid state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to the presence of partially flexible linear B=N linkages in the back&#173;bone.</dc:description>

         <title>An Investigation of Allyl&#8208;Substituted&#160;Bis(Diphosphine) Iron Complexes: Towards Precursors for Cooperative CO2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In developing homogenous catalysts capable of CO2&#160;activation, interaction with a metal center is often imperative. This work provides our primary efforts towards the cooperative activation of CO2&#160;using a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and iron via a paired theoretical/experimental approach. Specifically, we report efforts towards [Fe(diphosphine)2(N2)] as a CO2&#8208;coordinated synthon where diphosphine =&#160;1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;cyclohexylboraneyl)propylphosphino)ethane) (P2BCy4) or its precursor,&#160;tetrakisallyldiphosphinoethane (tape). Initial efforts toward the {Fe(0)&#8208;N2} complex were focused on deprotonation reactions of [Fe(diphosphine)2(H)(NCCH3)]+&#160;and reduction of [Fe(tape)2Cl2]. In the latter case, a mixture of intramolecularly p&#8208;bonded alkene and associated metallacyclic Fe(II)&#8212;H species were produced &#8211; heating this mixture provided the hydride as the major product. Notably, the interconversion of this pair counters that of related intermolecular reactions between [Fe(depe)2] (depe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) and ethylene, where hydride formation occurs subsequent to p&#8208;coordination; this has been probed by theoretical calculations. Finally, reactivity of the metallacyclic {Fe(II)&#8212;H} complex with CO2&#160;was probed, resulting in a pair of isomeric ferra(II)lactones.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Formation of Electroactive Graphene&#8208;Based Cementitious Composites: Towards Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of composites combining multiple components each one imparting a specific function to the ensemble is highly sought after for disruptive applications in chemistry and materials science, with a particular importance for the realization of smart structures. Here we report on the development of an unprecedented multifunctional cementitious composite incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO).&#160;By design, this material features enhanced electrical properties while retaining the excellent cement&#8217;s hydration and microstructure.The multiscale investigation on the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the dispersion allowed to establish an efficient preparation protocol for rGO aqueous dispersion as well as rGO&#8208;based cementitious composites using a commercial poly(carboxylate ether)&#8208;based superplasticizer. Conduction mechanisms within the matrix of rGO containing mortars were unraveled by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealing conductive paths originating from bulk cement matrix and rGO nanosheets in composites with rGO loadings as low as 0.075wt.%. For this rGO loading, we observed the reduction of the resistivity of bulk cement mortar layers from 18.3M&#937;&#160;cm to 2.8M&#937;&#160;cm. Moreover, the addition of 0.2wt.% of rGO resulted in the formation of rGO conductive paths with resistivity of 51.1k&#937;&#160;cm. These findings represent a major step forward towards the application of graphene in structural health monitoring of concrete structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Dyads and Triads of Boron Difluoride Formazanate and Boron Difluoride Dipyrromethene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dye&#8208;dye conjugates have attracted significant interest for their utility in applications such as bioimaging, theranostics, and light&#8208;harvesting. Many classes of organic dyes have been employed in this regard; however, building blocks don&#8217;t typically extend beyond small chromophores. This can lead to minor changes to the optoelectronic properties of the original dye. The exploration of dye&#8211;dye structures is impeded by long synthetic routes, incompatible synthetic conditions, or a mismatch of the desired properties. Here, we present the first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind dye&#8208;dye conjugates of boron difluoride complexes of formazanate and dipyrromethene ligands. These conjugates exhibit dual photoluminescence bands that reach the near&#8208;infrared spectral region and implicate anti&#8208;Kasha processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed the generation of polyanionic species that can reversibly tolerate the uptake of up to 6 electrons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that BF2 formazanates can serve as a synthetically accessible platform to build upon new classes &#160;of dye&#8208;dye conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulation in Charged Droplets Generates Distorted Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of various hydrogen&#8208;bonded resorcinarene&#8208;based capsules to bind &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkylbisDABCOnium (DnD) guests of different lengths was investigated in solution and in the gas phase. While no host&#8208;guest interactions were detected in solution, encapsulation could be achieved in the charged droplets formed during electrospray ionisation (ESI). This included guests which are far too long in their most stable conformation to fit inside the cavity of the capsules. A combination of three mass spectrometric techniques, collision&#8208;induced dissociation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry together with computational modelling allow us to determine the binding mode of the DnD guests inside the cavity of the capsules. Significant distortions of the guest into horseshoe&#8208;like arrangements are required to optimise cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with the host which also adopt distorted geometries with partially open hydrogen&#8208;bonding seams when binding longer guests. Such quasi &#8220;spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; capsules can form in the charged droplets during the ESI process as there is no competition between guest encapsulation and ion pair formation with the counterions that preclude encapsulation in solution. The encapsulation complexes are sufficiently stable in the gas phase &#8211; even when strained &#8211; because non&#8208;covalent interactions significantly strengthen in the absence of solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Interrelations between Linkage Isomers of an Efficient Square&#8208;planar Nickel(II) Nitrite Photoswitch in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch, with the 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyimino&#8208;3&#8208;[(2&#8217;&#8208;dimethylamino)ethyl]imino&#8208;1&#8208;propanone moiety used as the ancillary ligand, is reported. In the ground&#8208;state (&#8216;dark&#8217;) crystal structure, the studied compound exists predominantly as the nitro&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;N(O)2) isomer, however, traces of the exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;nitrito&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;ONO) forms are detected both at 100 K (4&#8722;5% each) and under ambient conditions (~9% each). When excited with the 405&#8722;530 nm LED light, the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization takes place. The total conversion exceeds 90%. The exo&#8208;nitrito linkage isomer constitutes the dominant photo&#8208;generated form, whereas the relative population of both nitrito species depends on temperature. The reaction is fully reversible and reproducible. The photo&#8208;products are stable up to 200 K. The system constitutes a good model case for the reaction mechanism studies. Thus, experimental and theoretical investigations on the photo&#8208;isomerism were conducted and are presented in detail.

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;basedPaddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMRChemical Shifts: Insights from QuantumMechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel com&#8208;plexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of anempirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere aboutthe bimetallic core. Only recently, a H(C)Rhtriple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously incon&#8208;ceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts onthe electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded ef&#8208;fects are dramatic: formal replacement of one out ofeight O&#8208;atoms in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of thecorresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000 ppm. The cur&#8208;rent paper provides the framework that allowsthis and related experimental observations made with a setof 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted.In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that theshielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of theequatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis.Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shield&#8208;ing but exert an electronic cis&#8208;effect that onto the neighboring equatorial sites. Furthermore, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic trans&#8208;effect of ligands ofdifferent donor strengths is reflected in the 103 Rh NMR shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based chelation&#8208;type ligands were designed and a detailed evaluation of the light&#8208;modulated changes in their properties were carried out. The photo&#8208;induced enhancement of solubility of one of the azopyrazole&#8208;based ligands enabled its utilization in modulation of catalytic activity of CuAAC reaction in water.







Abstract
We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as chelation&#8208;type light&#8208;controllable ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility, especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized towards controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.

         <title>Boosting the Cell Performance of the SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy Anodes via In&#8208;Situ Reduction/Oxidation Coating Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon monoxide (SiO) has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity as an alternative material for conventional graphite anode, but its poor electrical conductivity and irreversible side reactions at the SiO/electrolyte interface seriously reduce its cycling stability. Here, to overcome the drawbacks, the dicharged SiO anode coated with Cu coating layer is elaborately designed by in&#8208;situ reduction method. Compared with the pristine SiO anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery (293 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), the obtained SiO/Cu composite presents superior cycling stability (1206 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). The tight combination of Cu particles and SiO significantly improves the conductivity of the composite, effectively inhibits the side&#8208;reaction between the active material and electrolyte. In addition, polypyrrole&#8208;coated SiO composites are further prepared by in&#8208;situ oxidation method, which delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1311 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles. The in&#8208;situ coating strategies in this work provide a new pathway for the development and practical application of high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode.</dc:description>

Abstract
Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8722; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5&#8197;min) and good sorption capacity (388&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.

         <title>Manipulation of Hierarchical Chiral Self&#8208;assembly and Anion Recognition by Supramolecular Systems of &#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, Pillar[5]arenes, and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, as a modulator, successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates and modulated the ternary co&#8208;assembly to form hierarchically chiral leaves. By substituting highly similar polyoxometalates, the accurate balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range interactions is demonstrated to be the key to the formation of chiral hierarchical microstructures.







Abstract
Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD/&#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8722; (X=Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8211;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>

         <dc:description>
Phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate (depicted by the turtle), is an important bioanion that plays multiple roles in metabolic processes. Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, resulting in insight to its intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. Results indicate that an axial phosphate and proton interchange play important structural roles with changing environment.







Abstract
Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate. Together, the results provide significant insight to phytate's intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. The phytate ion pairs hold the tetrameric macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 DMSO&#8208;d6&#8201;:&#8201;D2O indicate 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Regime Switch in the Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Silicates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallophotoredox catalyzed coupling of an aryl bromide with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate can lead to the formation of large quantity of side products when subjected to high intensity/high frequency irradiation. Two regimes were found to be possible; the ability to switch from the quantitative coupling to the simultaneous coupling and degradation of the silicate was observed.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an arylbromide (Ar&#8722;Br) with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate (R&#8722;Si&#8854;) has been analyzed in depth using a continuum of analytical techniques (EPR, fluorine NMR, electrochemistry, photophysics) and modeling (micro&#8208;kinetics and DFT calculations). These studies converged on the impact of four control parameters consisting in the initial concentrations of the iridium photocatalyst ([Ir]0), nickel precatalyst ([Ni]0) and silicate ([R&#8722;Si&#8854;]0) as well as light intensity I0 for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8722;Br and R&#8722;Si&#8854;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8722;Br with R&#8722;Si&#8854; smoothly leading to Ar&#8722;R, with no side&#8208;product from R&#8722;Si&#8854; and a second one in which R&#8722;Si&#8854; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8722;Br and degraded to R&#8722;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) have potential for delivering organotin(IV) compounds in cancer therapy due to their water solubility, stability, non&#8208;toxicity, and photoluminescence. Two nanosystems were developed by grafting organotin fragments and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid onto NGQDs. In vitro tests demonstrated high cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and minimal effects on non&#8208;cancer cells (HEK293T), with successful uptake and release of the metallodrug in cancer cells.







Abstract
The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in&#8197;vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group&#8197;5 Elements as Electron&#8208;Density Acceptors
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the term erythronium bond (EyB) is proposed to name an attractive noncovalent interaction between any electrophilic element of group&#8197;5 and electron&#8208;rich atoms (Lewis bases or anions).







Abstract
Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level, atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group&#8197;5 elements and electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These kinds of bonding are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term erythronium bond is proposed to denote these bonds. X&#8208;ray structures of vanadate&#8208;dependent bromoperoxidases show that these interactions are present also in biological systems.

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure of octahedral platinum complexes with halogens or chalcogens was revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field. The formal IV platinum oxidation state was in no case supported except in combination with oxygen and fluorine. A new interpretation of the oxidative addition process was also provided.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the inverted ligand field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8722;F and Pt&#8722;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the density of states plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8722;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the inverted ligand field.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition by In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we described organocatalytic spirocyclization of keto&#8208;enone tethered enals via a reductive Michael/aldol condensation/Michael domino sequence. This method granted us access to the architecturally complex spirocyclic spiroindene&#8208;2&#8208;caboxaldehyde frameworks with excellent selectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good to moderate yields. Formation of aminoisobenzofulvenes was a key intermediate for intramolecular Michael addition as final spirocyclization step.







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented by in&#8197;situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade by iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.

Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline-derived amino-organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Post-methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions for the Conformational Control of Urea
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction has been developed as a means of establishing conformational control in sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing ureas. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives adopt a planar structure bearing an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement (X=S, Se). The rigidity of the structure and the acidity were found to increase in the order benzothiophene&lt;benzoselenophene ureas.







Abstract
Dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed as a novel means for the conformational control of urea derivatives. The formation of a chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction at both sides of the urea carbonyl group was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as computational studies including non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) plot index analysis, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis via DFT calculations. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives that bear chalcogen atoms (X=S and Se) adopt a planar structure via the carbonyl oxygen (O) with an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement on the same side of the molecule. The rigidity of the conformational lock was evaluated using the molecular arrangement in the crystal and the rotational barrier of benzochalcogenophene ring, which indicated a stronger conformational lock in benzoselenophene than in benzothiophene urea derivatives. Furthermore, the acidity of the urea derivatives increases according to the Lewis&#8208;acidic properties of the chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, whereby benzoselenophene urea is more acidic than benzothiophene urea. Tweezer&#8208;shaped urea derivatives were prepared, and their stereostructure proved the viability of the conformational control for defining the location of the substituents on the urea framework.

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solutions of 2,4,5,7&#8208;tetranitrofluorenone oximate (1) are blue (&#955;max&#8776;600&#8197;nm) in aprotic solvents, independently of polarity, while a red color (&#955;max&lt;560&#8197;nm) is obtained in protic solvents. The hypsochromic shift in absorption is in excellent correlation with the H&#8208;bond donating ability (&#945;) of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). [3]Helical, configurationally labile, 1 is further applied in recognition of enantiopure HBDs that induced electronic circular dichroism (ECD) upon complexation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. This study reports on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of anilines in the presence of aliphatic amines is illustrated utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction. Further, the defined principles of reactivity are shown to be broadly extended to other electrophiles.







Abstract
Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups are of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. This study reports a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction, anilines were shown to react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, this principle of reactivity was extended to other electrophiles and conditions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 grown on nickel mesh by electrodeposition for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly excellent and stable catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually pivotal for clean energy development. In this work, a heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 (Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1) was developed via simple one&#8208;step electrodeposition onto nickel mesh. The heterogeneous interface structure generates sufficient active sites, significantly improving OER performance with an overpotential of 174 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10), while Tafel slope is only 43.0 mV dec&#8722;1. In particular, Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1 is still able to operate stably at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 for 100 h without obvious potential decay. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ was detected by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, proving that the heterogeneous catalyst could stabilize the high&#8208;valence state of nickel as active sites to its superior OER performance. This work provides a convenient synthetic strategy for&#160;forming heterogeneous catalysts toward efficient water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28 g g&#8208;1&#160;at 25 &#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retained its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Bicyclophane&#8208;Based Molecular Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modular synthesis of a series of nanoscale phenylene bicyclophanes with an intraaanular orthogonal pillar is described. The compounds are obtained by a Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling condensation and are characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as well as in situ scanning tunneling microscopy at the solid/liquid interface of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. In addition, their structures and conformations are supported by quantum chemical calculations, also after adsorption to the substrate. A set of two alkyl chain substitution patterns as well as a combination of both was investigated with respect to their ability to form extended 2D&#8208;crystalline superstructures on graphite. It shows that not the most densely packed surface coverage gives the most stable structure, but the largest number of alkyl chains per molecule determines the structural robustness to alterations at the pillar functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Formate Catalyzed by a Neutral, Coordinatively Saturated Tris&#8208;Carbonyl Mn(I)&#8208;PNP Pincer&#8208;Type Complex</title>

         <dc:description>CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to formate was achieved (TONmax = ca. 3800) in the presence of the neutral, halide&#8208;free, coordinatively saturated tris(carbonyl) manganese pincer&#8208;type complex [Mn(PNP)(CO)3], bearing a diarylamido pincer&#8208;type PNP ligand, using DBU as base and LiOTf as Lewis acid additive, under mild reaction conditions (60 bar, 80 &#176;C). DFT calculations suggest that the precatalyst activation key step occurs by intermolecular, base assisted dihydrogen heterolytic splitting rather than by the expected ligand&#8208;assisted intramolecular MLC&#8208;type mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ru Nanoboxes with a Hexagonal Close&#8208;Packed Structure by Templating with Ag Nanocubes and Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and high utilization efficiency of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8208;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a Ru(acac)3 solution in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise into a suspension of Ag nanocubes in EG at 170 &#8451;, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the Ru(III) precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluate the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses using a model hydrogenation reaction and both samples show excellent performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A formal palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative (4 + 2) cycloaddition reaction between 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes has been developed to produce highly valuable, densely functionalized tetrahydroquinolines in moderate to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The optimised protocol tolerates a range of substituted 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes, which represent an under&#8208;utilized class of dipolarophile for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cycloadditions. The employed reaction methodology facilitates efficient cycloaddition with both N&#8208;H&#8208; and N&#8208;Ts&#8208;4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone dipole precursors. The stereochemistry of the major and minor diastereomeric (4 + 2) cycloadducts was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. A mechanistic rationale for the high intrinsic diastereoselectivity and preliminary enantioselective experiments are also presented. The tetrahydroquinoline cycloadduct products feature numerous pendant functionalities, including a vinyl handle, an internal alkyne motif and a nitro functionality (which functions as a latent C&#8208;3 nitrogen substituent) for further synthetic manipulations.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes by an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route for electrochemical carbon dioxide activation was discovered for a manganese tricarbonyl complex. This complex first undergoes an H&#8208;atom transfer through a non&#8208;innocent ancillary ligand before subsequent reductions towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;b&#8208;Br) (where HL=2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL=1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1&#8201;b&#8208;Br. Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2&#8201;a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(HL)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a-Br&lt;/b&gt;) and Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(MeL)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b-Br&lt;/b&gt;) (where HL=2-(2&#8217;-pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL=1-methyl-2-(2&#8217;-pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. A redox-active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a-Br&lt;/b&gt; displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b-Br&lt;/b&gt;. Notably, a one-electron reduction of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a-Br&lt;/b&gt; yields a structurally characterized H-bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&#8217;&lt;/b&gt;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)-Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H-atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low-energy pathway for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation by an earth-abundant metal complex catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hexakis&#8208;TIPS&#8208;Alkynylated Nonacenes: Persistent and Processible</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble nonacenes are stabilized via triisopropylsilyl&#8208;ethynylation, halogenation and methoxylation. The substitution resulted in the most stable nonacenes to date. Two derivatives were characterized by crystal structure analysis and one derivative is tested as thin&#8208;film transistor material.







Abstract
Four substituted nonacenes were prepared and characterized by UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl(TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8211;9&#8197;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#956;e=0.007&#8197;cm2/Vs; &#956;h=0.023&#8197;cm2/Vs).

         <title>Synchronous Proton&#8208;Hydride Transfer by a Pyrazole&#8208;Functionalized Protic Mn(I) Complex in Catalytic Alcohol Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protic Mn(I) complex featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the initial alcohol dehydrogenation step proceeds through a concerted proton and hydride transfers to pyrazolato N and Mn, respectively, on the metal&#8208;ligand construct.







Abstract
A series of Mn(I) complexes Mn(L1)(CO)3Br, Mn(L2)(CO)3Br, Mn(L1)(CO)3(OAc) and Mn(L3)(CO)3Br [L1=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, L2=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine, L3=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine] were synthesized and fully characterized. The acid&#8208;base equilibrium between the pyrazole and the pyrazolato forms of Mn(L1)(CO)3Br was studied by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. These complexes are screened as catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of primary alcohols and aromatic diamines for the synthesis of benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives with the release of H2 and H2O as byproducts. The protic complex Mn(L1)(CO)3Br shows the highest catalytic activity for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole derivatives with broad substrate scope, whereas a related complex [Mn(L3)(CO)3Br], which is devoid of the proton responsive &#946;&#8208;NH unit, shows significantly reduced catalytic efficiency validating the crucial role of the &#946;&#8208;NH functionality for the alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. Control experiments, kinetic and deuterated studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synchronous hydride&#8208;proton transfer by the metal&#8208;ligand construct in the alcohol dehydrogenation step.

         <title>Transition Metal Ions Influence the Performance of Photodetector of Two&#8208;Dimensional CdS Nanoplatelets</title>

The insertion of copper ions inside the two&#8208;dimensional CdS NPLs exhibits bright red photoluminescence and higher performance of photodetectors.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke's shifted emission at ~685&#8197;nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45&#8197;&#956;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs. Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120&#8197;ms), ~600&#8197;times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300&#8197;times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dyotropic Rearrangement of Diarylethenes: Scope, Mechanism, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual light&#8208;induced rearrangement of diarylethenes to products with complex tricyclic DihydroDithiaAcenaphthylene (DDA) core has been discovered by accident in 1999. Based on the data accumulated by 2022, it can be considered as a promising photoreaction that provides access to photo&#8208; and thermally stable colored species (dyes) with interesting properties and a range of applications.







Abstract
Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.

         <title>Modeling Reactivity of Nitrite and Nitrous Acid at a Phenolate Bridged Dizinc(II) Site: Insights into NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide from (in)organic nitrite at zinc(II): Reactions of a dizinc(II) coordination site with organonitrite or nitrous acid (RONO, R=tBu/amyl/H) result in the formation of a dark green colored arene&#8208;NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex. One electron reductive transformation of the NO+ charge&#8208;transfer moiety and zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex towards NO, in the presence of exogenous reductants, have been illustrated.







Abstract
Although nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at various transition metals including Fe and Cu are relatively well explored, examples of such a reaction at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) site are limited. The present report aims to gain insights into the reactivity of nitrite anions, nitrous acid (HONO), and organonitrite (RONO) at a dizinc(II) site. A phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II)&#8208;aqua complex [LHZnII(OH2)]2(ClO4)2 (1H&#8208;Aq, where LH=tridentate N,N,O&#8208;donor monoanionic ligand) is illustrated to react with tBuONO to provide a metastable arene&#8208;nitrosonium charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. UV&#8208;vis, FTIR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses suggests the presence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 arene&#8208;nitrosonium moiety. Furthermore, the reactivity of a structurally characterized zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) with a proton&#8208;source demonstrates HONO reactivity at the dizinc(II) site. Reactivity of both RONO (R=alkyl/H) at the phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II) site provides NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. Subsequently, the reactions of 2H with exogenous reductants (such as ferrocene, thiol, phenol, and catechol) have been illustrated to generate NO. In addition, NO yielding reactivity of [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) in the presence of the above&#8208;mentioned reductants have been compared with the reactions of complex 2H. Thus, this report sheds light on the transformations of NO2&#8722;/RONO (R=alkyl/H) to NO/NO+ at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) coordination motif.

         <title>Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;Analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combinations of diethyl ether&#8208; and carbene&#8208;coordinated diarylberyllium and beryllium dibromide complexes were shown to undergo reversible and irreversible Schlenk&#8208;type redistribution reactions depending on the steric demand of the aryl substituents affording the corresponding arylberyllium bromide complexes.Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;Analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects (Jones and Helling)







Abstract
The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides, are systematically studied. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp; Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp=2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp=c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2=C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on synthesis of a new bright blue&#8208;green fluorophore for targeted delivery of biologically active substances containing a carboxyl group. The resulting hybrids were thoroughly studied to understand their photophysical properties and behavior under various conditions. The mechanism of photorelease of caging molecules were studied. Biological experiments demonstrated their bioavailability and easy penetration into living cells.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1H, 13C NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLC&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.

The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of &lt;i&gt;Vero&lt;/i&gt; cells using the MTT-test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV-light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, we wished to synthesize P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of the above mentioned N&#8208;heterocycles. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y = alkoxy, aryl) (30%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, our method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect was significant as compared to that of the reference compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide and protein bioconjugation sees ever&#8208;growing applications in the pharmaceutical sector. Novel strategies and reagents that can address the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity issues inherent to these biomolecules, while delivering stable and functionalizable conjugates, are therefore needed. Herein, we introduce the crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) reagent JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 for the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. This easily accessed compound gives access to peptide conjugates or stapled peptides under mild and tuneable conditions. Applied to the antibody fragment of antigen binding (Fab) species, JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 delivered rebridged proteins in a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;reaction process with high regioselectivity, outperforming the standard reagents commonly used for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptionally stable and super&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts derived from semiconducting metal phosphonate frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two new isotypic semiconductive metal phosphonate frameworks Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8211;&#160;is 1,4&#8209;naphthalenediphosphonate). Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] have optical bandgaps of 1.7 eV and 2.5 eV respectively, which are within the semiconductive regime. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst generated a lower overpotential of 374 mV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8211;1&#160;at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2&#160;in alkaline electrolyte (1 mol L&#8211;1&#160;KOH), which is indicative of remarkably superior reaction kinetics. Benchmarking of the oxygen evolution reaction, OER of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] materials as precatalyst coupled with nickel foam (NF) showed exceptional long&#8208;term stability at a current density of 50 mA cm&#8211;2for water splitting compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C/RuO2@NF after 30 h in 1 mol L&#8208;1&#160;KOH. In order to further understand the OER mechanism, the transformation of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] into its electrocatalytically active species was investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the iconic characteristics of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is the possesssion of guest&#8208;accessible pores. Increasing pore size has a direct and often beneficial impact on a MOF&#8217;s adsorption and separation properties. However, as pore size increases, the resulting void spaces are often filled by interpenetrated frameworks, where one or more networks crystallize within the pore system of another identical network, reducing the MOF&#8217;s free volume and pore size. Furthermore, due to the thermodynamic favorability of interpenetration during solvothermal synthesis, techniques to synthetically differentiate interpenetrated from non&#8208;interpenetrated MOFs are paramount. Herein we report the synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 via halide mediated deinterpenetrative conversion of Zn4O&#8208;derived IRMOF&#8208;9. IRMOF&#8208;9, when treated with ethylammonium bromide, is quasi&#8208;selectively etched, revealing the non&#8208;interpenetrated analogue, IRMOF&#8208;10 (deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9), which can be isolated prior to complete dissolution by the bromide solution. Dye adsorption, surface area and pore size distribution analysis, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and elemental analysis are consistent with successful deinterpenetration.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism  and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a catalytic, enantioselective dearomative reaction of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols, which poses a synthetic challenge to organic chemists because of the relative ease of rearomatization via the elimination of a proton. In this work, the direct dearomatization of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in&#8208;situ generated ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). The reported convergent method allows the use of readily available simple 1&#8208;naphthols without pre&#8208;functionalization, furnishing a variety of naphthopyran derivatives in good yields (up to 96%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) under mild reaction conditions. The observed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities are the keys to the success of the current strategy utilizing o&#8208;QM as a diene surrogates, in combination with CPA catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrichment strategies for efficient CO2 electroreduction in acidic electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been recognized as an appealing route to remarkably accelerate the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle and reduce carbon emissions. Notwithstanding great catalytic activity that has been acquired in neutral and alkaline conditions, the carbonates generated from the inevitable reaction of the input CO2 with the hydroxide severely lower carbon utilization and energy efficiency. By contrast, CO2RR in an acidic condition can effectively circumvent the carbonate issues; however, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in acidic electrolytes will be decreased significantly due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;&#160;Enriching the CO2 and the key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and enhance the product selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2RR. In this review, the catalytic mechanism and key technique challenges of CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of enrichment strategies for promoting the CO2RR in the acidic electrolyte is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategies in acidic CO2RR are expounded.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in Cu and Ag capsules by CD and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and&#160;1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. Slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries&#160;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron&#8208;rich&#160;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group and the electron&#8208;poor 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without partial dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanically bonded amphiphile (MBA)&#8208;bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and prepared. In both the solution and aggregated states, H2 demonstrated pH&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity.







Abstract
Advanced Organic Chemical Materials Co&#8208;constructed Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.&#8201;e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Modulated Magnetization Dynamics of Mononuclear Trigonal Prismatic CoII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying alkyl chains with different lengths at the end of the CoII&#8208;SMM with a rigid D3h coordination geometry influence its magnetization dynamics. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination symmetry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics.







Abstract
Four benzeneboron&#8208;capped mononuclear CoII complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The CoII ions are all wrapped by the pocket&#8208;like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the CoII complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

         <title>Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous 1D polymerization of a PE derivative and the 2D polymerization of a BODIPY derivative is controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio. The resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibit morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features.







Abstract
One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional &#960;&#8208;systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self&#8208;sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Herein, it is established that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (PE) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (BODIPY) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of BODIPY is 50&#8201;% in the BODIPY&#8208;PE mixture, the 1D polymerization of PE is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle&#8208;like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8211;6. The addition of 75&#8201;% of BODIPY to PE resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8211;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of PE monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time&#8208;resolved emission studies.

&lt;p&gt;One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional &#960;-systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one- or two-dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self-sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor-acceptor pairs. Herein, it is established that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (&lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt;) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (&lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt;) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle-shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; is 50&#8201;% in the &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; mixture, the 1D polymerization of &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle-like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8211;6. The addition of 75&#8201;% of &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8211;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time-resolved emission studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties of a Series of Trinuclear Fe2Ru and Corresponding Pentanuclear Fe2Ru2Ag Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Complexes</title>

As the number of methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene of the terminal iron increases, the neighbouring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT energy increases in both the trinuclear N4+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) and the pentanuclear M5+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;NC&#8208;AgI&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) complexes, but the redox potential of the ruthenium in the pentanuclear system shows an opposite trend of change with respect to the corresponding trinuclear complexes.







Abstract
A series of trimetallic cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeII(dppe)CpMen] &#8208; [PF6]2 (N[PF6]2, n=0, N =1; n=1, N=2; n=3, N=3; Cp=cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, MeOpy=4&#8208;methoxypyridine) and their one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidized compounds N3+ and N4+ were synthesized and characterized. Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido&#8208;bridged pentanuclear compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeIII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;AgI&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeIII(dppe)CpMen][BF4]5 (M[BF4]5, n=0, M=4; n=1, M=5; n=3, M=6) were also obtained and well characterized. The investigations suggest that in the trinuclear system there exists remote interaction between the two Fe centers, but no significant interactions exist across the central silver unit between the metals on the two sides of the silver center in the pentanuclear system. In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT transitions, and the MM'CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+ series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining molecular quantum mechanical modeling and machine learning, reaction screening and discovery can be accelerated significantly. In this Concept, we walk through the main steps associated with a typical workflow for high&#8208;throughput reaction screening campaigns, and highlight best practices and potential pitfalls at every stage.







Abstract
Molecular quantum mechanical modeling, accelerated by machine learning, has opened the door to high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns of complex properties, such as the activation energies of chemical reactions and absorption/emission spectra of materials and molecules; in&#8197;silico. Here, we present an overview of the main principles, concepts, and design considerations involved in such hybrid computational quantum chemistry/machine learning screening workflows, with a special emphasis on some recent examples of their successful application. We end with a brief outlook of further advances that will benefit the field.

         <title>Highly Functionalized SWCNTs with a Dopamine Derivative as a Support for Pd Nanoparticles: A Recyclable Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitro Compounds and the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of dopamine azide on SWCNTs in o&#8208;DCB at 160&#8201;&#176;C gave a material with high degree of functionalization still maintaining &#960;&#8208;network of SWCNTs. The presence of the catechol units was exploited to immobilize palladium nanoparticles. The hybrid material was used as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with a dopamine derivative in which the amine group was converted to azide (dopamine azide). The direct reaction of SWCNTs and dopamine azide in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene at high temperature (160&#8201;&#176;C) led to very highly functionalized CNTs (&#8776;60&#8197;wt.%). Surprisingly, despite this high degree of functionalization, Raman spectroscopy detected a low disruption of the &#960;&#8208;network of the carbonaceous support. This finding was justified by the rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 of the sidewall carbon atoms of CNTs involved in the functionalization process. Further characterization by means of different techniques such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to shed some light on the chemical composition and morphology of the obtained material. Moreover, the estimation of the total content of phenolic units and their reducing potential after CNTs functionalization was also assessed using Folin and Ciocalteu and 2,2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picryl hydrazide (DPPH) assays. The functionalization of CNTs was exploited to immobilize palladium(II) species that were subsequently reduced with NaBH4 leading to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so obtained hybrid material was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.

         <title>Nucleophile&#8208;Triggered &#960;&#8208;Topological Transformation: A New Synthetic Approach to Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Rhodamines</title>

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method: A new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye, called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor), has been developed. Linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor is prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles (Nu&#8722;) with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability.







Abstract
We describe a &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor). In contrast to conventional NIR&#8208;emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative &#960;&#8208;electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the N&#8208;substituted group to obtain NIR&#8208;absorbing/emitting PeR Fluor. We also demonstrate the stimulus&#8208;responsive functionality of PeR Fluor through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.

Linear fully &#960;-conjugated &lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt; is prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles (Nu&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross-conjugated structure. &lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt; exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a &#960;-topological transformation-based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near-infrared (NIR)-emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine-embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (&lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt;). In contrast to conventional NIR-emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully &#960;-conjugated &lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt; can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross-conjugated structure. &lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt; exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative &#960;-electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted group to obtain NIR-absorbing/emitting &lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt;. We also demonstrate the stimulus-responsive functionality of &lt;b&gt;PeR Fluor&lt;/b&gt; through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our &#960;-topological transformation-based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene Acetals: Red&#8208;Shifted Solid&#8208;State and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters from a One&#8208;Pot Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the nucleophilicity of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, 23 diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be accessed, although the aroylation leads to a significant bathochromic shift both in the solid and aggregated states as well as an increase in aggregate stability. Cyclized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be converted into pyrazole systems in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
Symmetric and unsymmetric diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be readily accessed in consecutive syntheses in good to excellent yields by exploiting the inherent nucleophilic character of the methine position. Different aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals as well as acid chlorides yield a library of 19 diaroyl compounds with substitution and linker pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties, leading to a significant red&#8208;shift of emission in the solid and aggregated state, which was thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the stability of the luminescent aggregates is highly increased. In a follow&#8208;up one&#8208;pot procedure, pyrazolo&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be accessed employing a nucleophilic cyclocondensation.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Polymerization of a Lewis Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;pentafulvene)titanium in the reaction with Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomers provide a convenient new route to polyphosphinoboranes. This method offers access to high molecular mass materials under very mild conditions and short reaction times. The findings represent an unprecedented example of a transition&#8208;metal mediated polymerization of Lewis base&#8208;stabilized alkylphosphinoborane.







Abstract
The reaction of the Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomer tBuHPBH2NMe3 (2&#8201;a) with catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5:&#951;1&#8208;adamantylidenepentafulvene)titanium (1) provides a convenient new route to the polyphosphinoborane [tBuPH&#8208;BH2]n (3&#8201;a). This method offers access to high molar mass materials under mild conditions and with short reaction times (20&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h in toluene). It represents an unprecedented example of a transition metal&#8208;mediated polymerization of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized Group 13/15 compound. Preliminary studies of the substrate scope and a potential mechanism are reported.

         <title>&#8220;Holographic&#8221; Autostereoscopic Displays: A Perspective on Their Technology and Potential Impact in Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding dimensions to chemistry: I explore the potential of &#8220;holographic&#8221; autostereoscopic displays in chemistry research and education. This perspective delves into how this emerging technology could enhance the understanding of complex molecular structures, offering a more immersive and intuitive learning and research experience.







Abstract
The three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules is essential for understanding their properties and behavior. Traditional 2D representations and digital 3D models presented on 2D media often fall short in conveying the complexity of molecular structures. Autostereoscopic displays, often marketed as &#8220;holographic&#8221; displays, pose a potential solution to this challenge. These displays, with their multi&#8208;view and single&#8208;view configurations, promise to advance chemistry education and research by offering accurate 3D representations with depth and parallax. In this perspective, I delve into the possibilities and limitations of autostereoscopic displays in chemistry, discussing the underlying technology and potential applications, from research to teaching and science communication. Multi&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays excel in facilitating collaborative work by enabling multiple viewers to simultaneously perceive the same 3D structure from different angles. However, they currently suffer from low resolution and high cost, which could limit their immediate widespread adoption. Conversely, single&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays with eye&#8208;tracking, while limited to one viewer at a time, provide higher resolution at a lower cost, thus suggesting that they might become the technology of the future given the balance of price to performance. Despite current limitations, autostereoscopic displays possess undeniable potential for shaping the future of chemistry education and research.

         <title>Beta Amyloid Oligomers with Higher Cytotoxicity have Higher Sidechain Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical states of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm beta amyloid oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the sidechain molecular motion of the residue K16 is more dynamic. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.







Abstract
The underlying biophysical principle governing the cytotoxicity of the oligomeric aggregates of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides has long been an enigma. Here we show that the size of A&#946;40 oligomers can be actively controlled by incubating the peptides in reverse micelles. Our approach allowed for the first time a detailed comparison of the structures and dynamics of two A&#946;40 oligomers of different sizes, viz., 10 and 23&#8197;nm, by solid&#8208;state NMR. From the chemical shift data, we infer that the conformation and/or the chemical environments of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the molecular motion of the sidechain of its charged residue K16 is more dynamic. Interestingly, the residue A21 exhibits unusually high structural rigidity. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.

         <dc:description>The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimum photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61 umol&#183;h&#8208;1g&#8208;1) and CH4 (8.81 umol&#183;h&#8208;1g&#8208;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomass Separators as a&#8220;Lifesaver&#8221;for Safe and Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth&#160;of lithium dendrites and the shuttle of polysulfides in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have hindered their development. In LMBs, the cathode and anode are separated by a separator, although this does not solve the battery's issues. The use of biomass materials is widespread for modifying the separator due to their porous structure and abundant functional groups. LMBs perform more electrochemically when lithium ions are deposited uniformly and polysulfide shuttling is reduced using biomass separators. In this&#160;review, we analyze the growth of lithium dendrite and the shuttle of polysulfide in LMBs, summarize the types of biomass separator materials and the mechanisms of action&#160;(providing mechanical barriers, promoting uniform deposition of metal ions, capturing polysulfides, shielding polysulfide).&#160;The prospect of developing new separator materials from the perspective of regulating ion transport and physical sieving efficiency as well as the application of advanced technologies such as synchrotron radiation to characterize the mechanism of action of biomass separators is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Hamper Glutamate Mediated Excitotoxicity and Protect Neuronal Survival In An In vitro Stroke Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small graphene oxide (s&#8208;GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro&#8208;disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission. Excitotoxicity, namely cell death triggered by exceeding ambient glutamate fueling over&#8208;activation of excitatory synapses, is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several neural diseases, from ischemic stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. Here we exposed CNS cultures to oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke in vitro, and we show that the delivery of s&#8208;GO following OGD, during the endogenous build&#8208;up of secondary damage and excitotoxicity, improved neuronal survival. In a different paradigm, we reproduced excitotoxicity cell damage through exogenous glutamate application, and we observed that s&#8208;GO co&#8208;treatment protected neuronal integrity, potentially by directly downregulating the synaptic over&#8208;activation brought about by exogenous glutamate. In our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study we suggest that s&#8208;GO may find novel applications in therapeutic developments for treating excitotoxicity&#8208;driven neural cell death.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using the popular metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination self&#8208;assembly approach, donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates have been constructed using zinc tetrapyrroles (porphyrin (ZnP), phthalocyanine (ZnPc), and naphthalocyanine (ZnNc)) as electron donors and imidazole functionalized tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;TCBD) and Im&#8208;DCNQ) as electron acceptors.&#160; The newly formed donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates were fully characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods, including absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational methods. The measured binding constants for the 1:1 complexes were in the order of 104 &#8208; 105 M&#8208;1 in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene.&#160; Free&#8208;energy calculations and the energy level diagrams revealed the high exergonicity for the excited state electron transfer reactions. However, in the case of the ZnNc:Im&#8208;DCNQ complex, owing to the facile oxidation of ZnNc and facile reduction of Im&#8208;DCNQ, slow electron transfer was witnessed in the dark without the aid of light.&#160; Systematic transient pump&#8208;probe studies were performed to secure evidence of excited state charge separation and gather their kinetic parameters.&#160; The rate of charge separation was as high as 1011 s&#8208;1 suggesting efficient processes.&#160; These findings show that the present self&#8208;assembly approach could be utilized to build donor&#8208;acceptor constructs with powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, to witness ground and excited state charge transfer, fundamental events required in energy harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic Complexes Bridged by an Unsymmetrical Bis(NHC) Ligand: Study of Enhanced Catalytic Activity in Tandem Transformations and Understanding of Cooperativity between the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bis(azolium) salt [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 was found to serve as a suitable platform for accessing the heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;M (M = PdII/AuI) and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes. Initially, selective mono&#8208;metalation of [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 yielded an orthometalated IrIII&#8208; or non&#8208;orthometalated PdII&#8208;complex. Sequential metalation of the mono&#8208;IrIII complex resulted in the formation of heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII/AuI complexes. Similarly, a distinct heterobimetallic PdII&#8208;IrIII complex was synthesized starting from the mono&#8208;PdII complex. Further, the corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII and PdII&#8208;PdII complexes were directly obtained from [L1&#8208;H2]Br2. Additionally, monometallic PdII and IrIII analogues were synthesized from [L2&#8208;H]Br and [L3&#8208;H]Br, respectively. The heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes were then evaluated as catalysts in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions in which they demonstrated superior activity than the mixtures of both their corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII/PdII&#8208;PdII and monometallic IrIII/PdII counterparts, under the constant concentrations of metal centers. Moreover, while comparing complexes IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII, the former exhibits higher activity in all the studied reactions. All these findings suggest the presence of some form of cooperativity between the two metal centers (Ir and Pd) connected by a single ligand framework in IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complex, with IrIII&#8208;PdII displaying better cooperativity that has been validated by electrochemical, NMR, and DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gas due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretched Central Double Bonds in Dialumene and Disilene by Amino Substituents: A Case of Lone Pair Repulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The block&#8208;localized wavefunction method at the density functional theory level is employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents. The origin of the significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds in these molecules is the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond. Replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.







Abstract
There have been remarkable advances in the syntheses and applications of groups 13 and 14 homonuclear ethene analogues. However, successes are largely limited to aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Analogues bearing two or more heteroatoms are still scarce. In this work, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level was employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents whose optimal geometries exhibit significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds compared with aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Computational analyses showed that the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond plays a critical role in the elongation of the M=M bonds. Evidently, replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative activation of carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions have become a highly popular strategy whose chemical designs span across the whole periodic table. This perspective categorizes the wide variety of systems reported and assesses their limitations and prospects to develop catalytic functionalization protocols.







Abstract
The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium, alkynes were hydrated under bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents). This Fe&#8208;DES could be recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent (E factor = 10). Furthermore, the Fe&#8208;DES is able to promote the efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the system being recycled up to three consecutive times. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Presa&#8197;Soto, V. del&#8197;Amo, J. Garc&#237;a&#8208;&#193;lvarez, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301736).

         <title>A 2,2&#8208;Difluoroimidazolidine Derivative for Deoxyfluorination Reactions: Mechanistic Insights by Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination: The deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 converts carboxylic acids into acyl fluorides and is capable of difluorinating aldehydes. Experimental and computational studies show that an imidazolidinium salt bearing an F(HF)2&#8722; anion serves as crucial intermediate.







Abstract
A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium chloride (3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in&#8197;situ fluorination of the generated carboxylic acid was developed.

         <title>Boosting the oxygen evolution activity of FeNi oxides/hydroxides by molecular and atomic engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FeNi oxides/hydroxides are the best performing catalysts for oxidizing water at basic pH. Consequently, their improvement is the cornerstone to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. During the last 5 years different reports have demonstrated an enhancement of their activity by engineering their structures via: (1) modulation of the number of oxygen, iron and nickel vacancies;(2) single atoms (SAs) doping with metals such as Au, Ir, Ru and Pt; and (3) modification of their surface using organic ligands. All these strategies have led to more active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution rection (OER). In this Concept we critically analyze these strategies using the most relevant examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Pioneering the Power of Twin&#160;Bonds in a Revolutionary Double Bond Formation. Unveiling the True Identity of o&#8208;Carboryne as o&#8208;Carborene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homolytic elimination of two H atoms from two adjacent carbons in benzene results in the aromatic product o&#8208;benzyne. In a similar way, the homolytic elimination of two H atoms from the two adjacent carbons in 1,2&#8208;C2B10H12 results in the aromatic product o&#8208;carboryne. In this work, we provide experimental and computational evidences that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8211;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8211;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8211;C bond is a double bond. Therefore, we must stop naming o&#8208;carboryne to 1,2&#8208;dehydro&#8208;o&#8208;carborane but to call it o&#8208;carborene.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Deformed and Conformationally Rigid Phosphorus Trisamides featuring an Unsymmetrical Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonclassical P(III) centers have attracted much attention in recent years. Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers a particularly attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom that may in turn induce unusual reactivity. Although still relatively scarcely explored, phosphorus centers enforced in a non&#8208;C3 symmetry have gained significant traction lately. However, the current scaffolds are based on a relatively limited set of design principles and ligand platforms associated therewith. We herein focus on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform derived from 2&#8208;(methylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylamino)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a convenient synthesis for symmetrical and mixed substituted tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) starting from red phosphorus. All TAPs exhibit a phosphaalkene&#8208;acylphosphine equilibrium, which was investigated in detail by variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR spectroscopy supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the substituents, two phosphaalkene derivatives and six acylphosphine derivatives could be isolated. NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography enabled a clear structural assignment of these compounds. Oxidation of selected TAPs led to the formation of the corresponding tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Furthermore, their spectroscopic properties as well as their photochemistry was investigated. Especially, the TAPO compounds were evaluated for their suitability as photoinitiators by CIDNP spectroscopy, photobleaching measurements and by storage stability tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Initial quenching efficiency determines light&#8208;driven H2 evolution of [Mo3S13]2&#8208; in lipid bilayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses reactive components embedded in biological membranes to perform light&#8208;driven photosynthesis. Here, we report a model artificial photosynthetic system for light&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. The system is based on liposomes where amphiphilic ruthenium trisbipyridine based photosensitizer (RuC9) and the H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalyst [Mo3S13]2&#8208; are embedded in biomimetic phospholipid membranes. When DMPC was used as the main lipid of these light&#8208;active liposomes, increased catalytic activity (TONCAT ~ 200) was observed compared to purely aqueous conditions. Although all tested lipid matrixes, including DMPC, DOPG, DPPC and DOPG liposomes provided similar liposomal structures according to TEM analysis, only DMPC yielded high H2 amounts. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements using Pd microsensors revealed an induction period of around 26 minutes prior to H2 evolution, indicating an activation mechanism which might be induced by the fluid&#8208;gel phase transition of DMPC at room temperature. Stern Volmer&#8208;type quenching studies revealed that electron transfer dynamics from the excited state photosensitizer are most efficient in the DMPC lipid environment giving insight for design of artificial photosynthetic systems using lipid bilayer membranes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the vibrant field of SF5 chemistry, SF5X reagents (X = F, Cl, Br) are at the heart of current investigations in radical pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. Alas! SF5I is the missing link whose existence has not been reported albeit its potential as SF5 donor. We herein report the formal addition of the hitherto unknown SF5I reagent to alkynes by means of a combination of SF5Cl / KI / 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The exclusive regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of unprecedented (E)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;l6&#8208;sulfanyl) alkenes was achieved. A consensus was reached through computational and mechanistic studies for the realistic formation of SF5&#8211; anion but not SF5I in solution and the rational involvement of SF5&#183; and iodine radicals in the iodo pentafluorosulfanylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Living Topochemical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Achiral Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;Anhydrides in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a living topochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of achiral amino&#8208;acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs). Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. Single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25 &#8211; 50 &#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40 units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer&#8217;s head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as also chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Aspects about &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; in Upconversion Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent progress on the temporal response (TR) of lanthanide upconversion luminescence (UCL) has enriched the means of UCL regulation, promoted advanced designs for customized applications such as biological diagnosis, high&#8208;capacity optical coding, and dynamic optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and pushed us to reacquaint the dynamic responses of sensitizer/activator ions in UCL system. In particular, the lifetime of UCL should be revisited after discovery of novel experimental phenomena and luminescence mechanisms, i.e., it should be understood as the collective TR (in the decay edge) of all the involved ions rather than the reciprocal of the radiative rate of an individual ion. In this Concept, we retraced the latest understanding of the dynamics in UCL with special attention to the relationship between excitation and emission, means of TR regulation, and discussed existing challenges. It is expected to provide some fundamental insights to deepened understanding, further regulation, and frontier applications of TR features of UCL.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We described herein a one&#8208;pot diazotization/gold&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides. After diazotization, Me2SAuCl triggers an oxy&#8208; and/or chloroarylation of the alkyne moiety, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show the significant energetic preference of both processes over an insertion pathway.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation of trifluoromethyl phenyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones using homoallenols as 1,3&#8208;dienyl sources. This protocol provides a variety of &#945;&#8208;(di)fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinyl allyl ketones with excellent functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds through a silver carbene&#8208;initiated sequential etherification and Claisen type [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement cascade. The synthetic utility of this chemistry was demonstrated through the downstream synthetic elaboration toward diverse synthetically useful building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Beryllium: Covalent Bonding Between s&#8208;block Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a planar hypercoordinate arrangement of s&#8208;block metals through covalent bonding with ligands is challenging due to the strong ionicity involved. Herein, we report the first case of a neutral binary global minimum containing a planar hexacoordinate beryllium (phBe) atom. The central Be atom is coordinated by six active Be atoms, latter in turn are enclosed by an equal number of more electronegative chlorine atoms in the periphery, forming a star&#8208;like phBe cluster (Be&#169;Be6Cl6). Importantly, the cluster exhibits dynamically stabilized stemming geometrically from the appropriate matching of metal&#8208;ligand size and electronically from adherence to the octet rule as well as possessing the 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Remarkably, energy decomposition analysis&#8211;natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis reveals a significant covalent interaction between the ligand and the central metal beryllium atoms, a fact further supported by a large Wiberg bond index. This cluster is a promising synthetic as its excellent electronic, dynamic and thermodynamic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipolarophile&#8208;Steered Formal Stereodivergent Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans&#8208;Pyrrolidines Based on Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.</dc:description>
