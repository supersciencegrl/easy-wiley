      <title>Discovery of Homobivalent Bitopic Ligands of the Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor</title>
      <dc:description>Single chemical entities with potential to simultaneously interact with two binding sites are emerging strategies in medicinal chemistry. We have designed, synthesized and functionally characterized the first bitopic ligands for the CB  2  receptor. These compounds selectively target CB  2  versus CB  1  receptors. Their binding mode was studied by molecular dynamic simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis</dc:description>

      <title>Synergistic Self&#8208;Assembly of Oxoanions and d&#8208;Block Metal Ions with Heteroditopic Receptors into Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates</title>
      <dc:description>Cooperativity effects among the interconnected anion and cation binding sites can profoundly alter the performance of heteroditopic receptors in selective ion pair recognition, processes that are oftentimes pertinent to biological systems and chemical separations. Herein, we report the effect of the linker that connects both binding sites on self&#8208;assembly of heteroditopic receptors in the presence of divalent first&#8208;row transition metal salts in solution and solid phase.

      <title>A Lamellar MWW Zeolite With Silicon and Niobium Oxide Pillars: A Catalyst for the Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
Pillars are not only used as structural elements in architecture or civil engineering but also on a nanoscale to obtain 2D vertical zeolitic architectures with improved interlamellar accessibility. This work aims to use pillars containing silicon and niobium oxides, with the latter as an active phase for the catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), which is an important reaction for environmentally clean technology.

      <title>Chalcogen Stabilized bis&#8208;Hydridoborate Complexes of Cobalt: Analogues of Tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane</title>
      <dc:description>Treatment of Li[BH3ER] (E = Se or Te, R = Ph; E = S, R = CH2Ph) with [Cp*CoCl]2 led to the formation of hydridoborate complexes, [{CoCp*Ph}{Cp*Co}{&#181;&#8208;EPh}{&#181;&#8208;k2&#8208;E,H&#8210;EBH3}], 1a and 1b (1a: E = Se; 1b: E = Te) and a bis&#8208;hydridoborate species [Cp*Co{&#181;&#8208;k2&#8208;Se,H&#8210;SeBH3}]2, 2. All the complexes, 1a, 1b and 2 are stabilised by &#946;&#8208;agostic type interaction in which 1b represents a novel bimetallic borate complex with a rare B&#8208;Te bond. QTAIM analysis furnished direct proof for the existence of a shared and dative B&#8208;chalcogen and Co&#8208;chalcogen interactions, respectively. In parallel to the formation of the hydridoborate complexes, the reactions also yielded tetracyclic species, [Cp*Co{&#954;3&#8208;E,H,H&#8210;E(BH2)2&#8210;C5Me5H3}], 3a and 3b (3a: E = Se and 3b: E = S), wherein the bridgehead boron atoms are surrounded by one chalcogen, one cobalt and two carbon atoms of a cyclopentane ring. Molecules 3a and 3b are best described as the structural mimic of tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane having identical structure and similar valence electron counts.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Treatment of Li[BH3ER] (E = Se or Te, R = Ph; E = S, R = CH2Ph) with [Cp*CoCl]2 led to the formation of hydridoborate complexes, [{CoCp*Ph}{Cp*Co}{&#181;&#8208;EPh}{&#181;&#8208;k2&#8208;E,H&#8210;EBH3}], 1a and 1b (1a: E = Se; 1b: E = Te) and a bis&#8208;hydridoborate species [Cp*Co{&#181;&#8208;k2&#8208;Se,H&#8210;SeBH3}]2, 2. All the complexes, 1a, 1b and 2 are stabilised by &#946;&#8208;agostic type interaction in which 1b represents a novel bimetallic borate complex with a rare B&#8208;Te bond. QTAIM analysis furnished direct proof for the existence of a shared and dative B&#8208;chalcogen and Co&#8208;chalcogen interactions, respectively. In parallel to the formation of the hydridoborate complexes, the reactions also yielded tetracyclic species, [Cp*Co{&#954;3&#8208;E,H,H&#8210;E(BH2)2&#8210;C5Me5H3}], 3a and 3b (3a: E = Se and 3b: E = S), wherein the bridgehead boron atoms are surrounded by one chalcogen, one cobalt and two carbon atoms of a cyclopentane ring. Molecules 3a and 3b are best described as the structural mimic of tetracyclo[4.3.0.02,4.03,5]nonane having identical structure and similar valence electron counts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Intrinsic Contributions of 2&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxyl to the Hydration of Nucleoside at Monomeric Level</title>
      <dc:description>Although many reports have revealed the structural differences between DNA and RNA at the polymeric level, there is no comparative studies with 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside and ribonucleoside to explore the roles of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group at the monomeric level under the same conditions. Inspired by these, in this work, the intrinsic contributions of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group in nucleoside have been systematically investigated by directly solving the single crystal structures of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenosine (  1  ), 2&#8208;aminoadenosine (  2  ), and 2&#8208;aminoarabinofuranosyladenine (  3  ) in water. Interestingly,  1  , which does not contain the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group, displayed strong hydration, while  2  and  3  exhibited no hydration, which is completely different to that observed in nucleic acids. Meanwhile we found that compound 1 can lock the water molecules to form unique trihydrol moieties, which further serve as the backbone to construct, to our best knowledge, the simplest double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;like structures. To this end, in order to investigate the effect of the biological environment on these unique structures, the solvent was changed from water to phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS). Surprisingly, such a subtle adjustment led to entirely different superstructures, consisting of two&#8208;dimensional lamellar structures in water and three&#8208;dimensional porous structures in PBS. These large morphological differences could be attributed to delicate ion hydration, which was also confirmed using variable temperature X&#8208;ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and intermolecular interaction energy calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning of Morphology by Chirality in Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Bis(Urea) Amphiphiles in Water</title>
      <dc:description>We present the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of a chiral bis(urea) amphiphile and show that chirality offers a remarkable level of control towards different morphologies. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the molecular scale chiral information is translated to the mesoscopic level. Both enantiomers of the amphiphile self&#8208;assemble into chiral twisted ribbons with opposite handedness, as supported by Cryo&#8208;TEM and CD measurements. The system presents thermo&#8208;responsive aggregation behaviour and combined transmittance measurements, temperature dependent UV, CD, TEM and micro&#8208;DSC show that a ribbon&#8208;to&#8208;vesicles transition occurs upon heating. Remarkable, chirality allows easy control of morphology as the self&#8208;assembly into distinct aggregates can be tuned by varying the enantiomeric excess of the amphiphile, giving access to flat sheets, helical ribbons, and twisted ribbons.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The thioredoxin system, composed of thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin reductase (TR), and NADPH, plays critical roles in many cellular functions. However, it is also overexpressed in many solid tumors. Thus, many inhibitors have been developed to target TR and TRX, such as, natural products, ebselen analogues, metal complexes, and small molecules.

      <title>Bioinspired Scaffolding by Supramolecular Amines Allows the Formation of One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Dimensional Silica Superstructures</title>
      <dc:description>Silica materials attract an increasing amount of interest and find applications in e.g. sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery. As the properties of silica nanomaterials not only depend on their chemistry but also their size, shape, and surface area, the controllable synthesis of silica is essential for tailoring the materials to specific applications. Advantageously, bioinspired routes for silica production are environmental&#8208;friendly and straightforward since the formation process is spontaneous and proceeds under mild conditions. These strategies mostly employ amine&#8208;bearing phosphorylated (bio)polymers. In this work, we expand this principle to supramolecular polymers based on the water&#8208;soluble cationic cyanine dye Pinacyanol acetate. Upon assembly, these dyes form large, polyaminated, supramolecular fibers. The surfaces of these fibers can be used as a scaffold for the condensation of silicic acid. Control over the ionic strength, dye concentration, and silicic acid saturation yielded silica fibers with a diameter of 25 nm and a single, 4 nm pore.&#160; Unexpectedly, other unusual superstructures, namely, nummulites and spherulites, were also found. SAXS and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy revealed ionic strength and dye concentration hardly affect the morphology of the supramolecular scaffold. TIRF unraveled that under static conditions, only silica fibers are obtained. This evidenced that the marked structural diversity originates from the shear&#8208;induced arrangement of silica/dye fibers. Under these mild conditions, external force fields have a profound influence on silica morphology.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the time scale of conformational plasticity and allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction of human galectin&#8208;1 with a variety of oligosaccharides, from di&#8208; (N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) to tetra&#8208;saccharides (blood B type&#8208;II antigen) has been scrutinized by using a combined approach of different NMR experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Ligand&#8208; and receptor&#8208;based NMR experiments assisted by computational methods allowed proposing three&#8208;dimensional structures for the different complexes, which explained the lack on enthalpy gain when increasing the chemical complexity of the glycan. Interestingly, and independently of the glycan ligand, the entropy term does not oppose the binding event, a rather unusual feature for protein&#8208;sugar interactions. CLEANEX&#8208;PM and relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that sugar binding affected residues far from the binding site and described significant changes in the dynamics of the protein. In particular, motions in the microsecond&#8208;millisecond timescale in residues at the protein dimer interface were identified in the presence of high affinity ligands. The dynamic process was further explored by extensive MD simulations, which provided additional support for the existence of allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.</dc:description>

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Resorcin[4]arene Cavitands: Toward Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Molecular Grippers</title>
      <dc:description>
Kite in a vase: Resorcin[4]arene cavitands functionalized with an electron&#8208;accepting quinone and a [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) photosensitizing wall can be switched upon visible&#8208;light irradiation between a flat kite in the quinone state Q and a vase conformation in the semiquinone radical anion state SQ. Conformational switching can also be triggered by changes in solvent or host&#8211;guest interactions.







Abstract
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands, equipped with diverse quinone (Q) and [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) photosensitizing walls in different configurations, were synthesized. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 420&#8197;nm, electron transfer from the [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ to the Q generates the semiquinone (SQ) radical anion, triggering a large conformational switching from a flat kite to a vase with a cavity for the encapsulation of small guests, such as cyclohexane and heteroalicyclic derivatives, in CD3CN. Depending on the molecular design, the SQ radical anion can live for several minutes (&#8776;10&#8197;min) and the vase can be generated in a secondary process without need for addition of a sacrificial electron donor to accumulate the SQ state. Switching can also be triggered by other stimuli, such as changes in solvent, host&#8211;guest complexation, and chemical and electrochemical processes. This comprehensive investigation benefits the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanodevices, such as light&#8208;activated molecular grippers.

      <title>Organoboron Derivatives of Stereoregular Phenylcyclosilsesquioxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of new precursors for producing HOFs: systems that are capable of reversible structure reorganization are reported. A simple and convenient method is described for creation of a new class of borosiloxane compounds by combination of a very flexible siloxane framework with fragments of boric acid derivatives. Organoboron derivatives of stereoregular phenylcyclosilsesquioxanes were obtained in high yields. Such compounds can be used for preparation of macro initiators and for synthesizing macromolecular scaffolds in Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

      <title>Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Cationic Intermediates for the Synthesis of Chiral N,O&#8208;Acetals</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral N,O&#8208;acetals could be easily prepared by asymmetric hydrogenation! Construction of this family of challenging molecules has never been a easy task, until this work. Under an acidic condition, acyl salicylamides undergo cyclization to form a cationic intermediate, which could be reduced by an iridium catalyst. Hydrogenation of cationic sp2&#8208;carbon yielded chiral sp3&#8208;chiral carbon. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Wen, X. Zhang, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Doubly Boron&#8208;doped TADF Emitters Decorated with ortho&#8208;Donor Groups for Highly Efficient Green to Red OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>Doubly boron&#8208;doped thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on a 9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) acceptor decorated with  ortho  &#8208;donor groups (Cz2  o  DBA,  2  ; BuCz2  o  DBA,  3  ; DMAC2  o  DBA,  4  ) are prepared to realize high&#8208;efficiency green&#8208;to&#8208;red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of  2  and  4  reveal the symmetrical and highly twisted  ortho  &#8208;donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) structure of the emitters. The twisted conformation leads to a very small energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  &lt; 0.08 eV) between the excited singlet and triplet states that gives rise to strong TADF, as supported by theoretical studies. Depending on the strength of the donor moieties, the emission color is fine&#8208;tuned in the visible region from green (  2  ) to yellow (  3  ) to red (  4  ). Carbazole&#8208;containing  2  and  3  exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 100%, whereas DMAC&#8208;substituted  4  is moderately emissive (PLQY = 44%) in a doped host film. Highly efficient green&#8208;to&#8208;red TADF&#8208;OLEDs are realized with the proposed  ortho  &#8208;D&#8722;A&#8722;D compounds as emitters. The green and yellow OLEDs incorporating Cz2  o  DBA (  2  ) and BuCz2  o  DBA (  3  ) emitters exhibit high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26.6% and 21.6%, respectively. In particular, the green device shows an excellent power efficiency above 100 lm W  &#8722;1  . A red OLED fabricated with a DMAC2  o  DBA (  4  ) emitter exhibits a maximum EQE of 10.1% with an electroluminescence peak at 615 nm.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the high performance anode material of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O microrods wrapped by reduced graphene oxide for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi&#8208;step solvo/hydro&#8208;thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4&#183;2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O. The CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and has superior long&#8208;cycle stability. In addition, in&#8208;situ Raman, in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO. This work also supplies a new perspective and certain research basis for the application of metal oxalate materials in high performance lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

The molecule of  1  possesses a nearly planar TeN  2  O  2  fragment, which suggests the formulation of  1  as Te II  L 2&#8211;  in agreement with the results of DFT calculations and QTAIM and NBO analyses. Reduction of  1  with one eq. of [CoCp2  ] leads to quantitative formation of the paramagnetic salt [CoCp2  ]+  [  1  ]&#8208;&#183;, characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The solution EPR spectrum of [CoCp2  ]+  [  1  ]&#8208;&#183;  at room temperature features a quintet due to splitting on two equivalent  15  N nuclei. Below 150 K it turns into a broad singlet line with two weak satellites due to the splitting on the  125  Te nucleus. The two&#8208;component DFT calculations perfectly reproduce the a(15  N) HFI constants and  A II  (125  Te) value responsible for the low&#8208;temperature satellite splitting. Wherein, the calculations predict that the additional electron in  1&#8208;&#183;  is localized mainly on L, while the spin density is delocalized over the whole molecule with significant (~30%) localization on Te atom. All these data suggest that  1&#8208;&#183;  can be regarded as the first example of a structurally characterized tellurium&#8208;nitrogen radical anion.</dc:description>

      <title>Growth of giant peptide vesicles driven by compartmentalized transcription&#8208;translation activity</title>
      <dc:description>Compartmentalization and spatial organization of biochemical reactions are essential for the establishment of complex metabolic pathways inside synthetic cells. Phospholipid and fatty acid membranes are the most natural candidates for this purpose, but also polymers have shown great potential as enclosures of artificial cell mimics.

The peptide vesicles can accommodate cell&#8208;free gene expression reactions, which is demonstrated by the transcription of a fluorescent RNA aptamer and the production of a fluorescent protein.

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions and their application in SF6&#160;activation</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of the strong monophosphazene base with the weakly acidic phenol leads to the formation of a phenol&#8208;phenolate anion with a moderately strong hydrogen bond. Application of the more powerful tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) renders the isolation of the corresponding salt with a free phenolate anion possible. This compound represents the first species featuring the free phenolate anion [H5C6&#8208;O]&#8208;. The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with tetraphosphazene bases represents a great way for the clean preparation of salts featuring free phenolate anions and in addition allows the selective syntheses of hydrogen bonded phenol&#8208;phenolate salts. Herein we present a phosphazenium phenolate salt with a redox potential of &#8209;0.72&#160;V and its capability for the selective activation of the chemically inert greenhouse gas SF6. The performed two&#8208;electron reduction of SF6&#160;leads to phosphazenium pentafluorosulfanide ([SF5]&#8208;) and fluoride salts.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiple Disentangling Effects on Excited State Intramolecular Charge Transfer Among Asymmetrical Tripartite PPI&#8208;TPA/PCz Triads</title>
      <dc:description>B   y   utilizing the bipolarity of 1,2&#8208;diphenylphenanthroimidazole (PPI), two types of asymmetrical tripartite triads (PPI&#8208;TPA and PPI&#8208;PCz) have been designed with triphenylamine (TPA) and 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;   carbazole  (PCz), respectively. These triads are the deep&#8208;blue luminescent materials with a high fluorescence quantum yield of nearly 100%.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;B   y   utilizing the bipolarity of 1,2&#8208;diphenylphenanthroimidazole (PPI), two types of asymmetrical tripartite triads (PPI&#8208;TPA and PPI&#8208;PCz) have been designed with triphenylamine (TPA) and 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;   carbazole  (PCz), respectively. These triads are the deep&#8208;blue luminescent materials with a high fluorescence quantum yield of nearly 100%.  To trace the photophysical behaviors of  these novel triads,  the excited states evolution channels  and interchromophoric interactions of these triads were investigated by ultrafast time&#8208;resolved transient absorption and excited states theoretical calculations. The results suggest that the electronic nature of moieties, asymmetrical tripartite structure and the distance of electron&#8208;hole of these triads as well as the polarity of solvent determine the lifetime of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).

      <title>On&#8208;demand Hydrophobic Drug Release Based on Microwaveresponsive

Graphene Hydrogel Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>Electromagnetically driven drug delivery systems stand out among stimulus&#8208;responsive materials due to their ability to release cargo on demand by remote stimulation, such as light, near infrared (NIR) or microwave (MW) radiation. MW&#8208;responsive soft materials, such as hydrogels, generally operate at 2.45 GHz frequencies, which usually involves rapid overheating of the scaffold and may affect tissue surrounding the target location. In contrast, 915 MHz MW penetrate deeper tissues and are less prone to induce rapid overheating. In order to circumvent these limitations, we present here for the first time a graphene&#8208;based hydrogel that is responsive to MW irradiation of &#957; = 915 MHz. This system is a candidate soft scaffold to deliver a model hydrophobic drug. The graphene present in the hydrogel acts as a heat&#8208;sink and avoids overheating of the scaffold upon MW irradiation. In addition, the microwave trigger stimulates the  in vitro  delivery of the model drug, thus suggesting a remote and deep&#8208;penetrating means to deliver a drug from a delivery reservoir. Moreover, the MW&#8208;triggered release of drug was observed to be enhanced under acidic conditions, where the swelling state is maximum due to the swelling&#8208;induced pH&#8208;responsiveness of the hydrogel. The hybrid composite described here is a harmless means to deliver remotely a hydrophobic drug on demand with a MW source of 915 MHz.  Potential uses in biomedical applications were evaluated by cytotoxicity tests.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleation of Tiny Silver Nanoparticles Using a Tetrafacial Organic Molecular Barrel for Potential Use in Visible Light Triggered Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of discrete molecular architectures of diverse shapes and sizes is well studied in last three decades. Use of dynamic imine bond for designing analogous metal&#8208;free architectures is a growing challenge in recent time. This article reports an organic molecular barrel (OB4R) as a potential template for nucleation and stabilization of very tiny (&lt; 1.5 nm) Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). Imine bond condensation of a rigid tetra&#8208;aldehyde with a flexible diamine followed by imine&#8208;bond reduction yielded the discrete tetragonal organic barrel (OB4R). Presence of molecular pocket ornamented with eight diamine moieties is potential for encapsulation of silver(I). The organic barrel was finally used as a molecular vessel for the controlled nucleation of AgNPs with fine size tuning via binding of Ag(I) ions in the confined space of barrel followed by reduction. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of the Ag(0)@OB4R composite revealed that the mean particle size is 1.44&#177;0.16 nm. The composite material has ~52 wt% silver loading. The barrel supported ultrafine AgNPs [Ag(0)@OB4R] are found to be efficient photocatalyst for facile Ullmann&#8208;type aryl&#8208;amination coupling of haloarenes at ambient temperature without using any additives. The catalyst was stable for several cycles of reuse without any agglomeration. The new composite Ag(0)@OB4R represents the first example of discrete organic&#8208;barrel supported AgNPs employed as photocatalyst in Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reaction at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring a Dress to Single Protein Molecules: Proteins Can Do It Themselves through Localized Photo&#8208;Polymerization and Molecular Imprinting.</title>
      <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MIP NPs) are antibody&#8208;like recognition materials prepared by a template assisted synthesis. MIP NPs able to target biomolecules, like proteins, are under the spotlight for their great potential in medicine, but using the molecular imprinting technique with biological macromolecular templates efficiently is still very challenging. Here we propose generating a molecular imprint in single NPs, by photochemically initiating the polymerization from individual protein templates. In this way, each protein molecule somehow tailors itself its own 'polymeric dress'. For this, the template protein is covalently coupled with a photoinitiator, Eosin Y. Irradiated with light at 533 nm, the Eosin moiety acts as an antenna and transfers energy to a co&#8208;initiator (an amine), which generates a radical and initiates polymerization. As a result, a polymer network is forming only around the very template molecule, producing cross&#8208;linked NPs of 50 nm, with single binding sites showing high affinity (K D 10 &#8208;9 M) for their biological target, and selectivity over other proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral Catalysts for Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>In the past decades, processes that involve transition&#8208;metal catalysis have represented a major part of synthetic tools. Recently, the interest shifted from the well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling reactions to C&#8211;H bond functionalization, thus making it a current frontier of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Constant progress in this field has led to the discovery of enantioselective methods to generate and control various types of stereogenic elements, thereby demonstrating its high value to generate scalemic chiral molecules. The present review is dedicated to enantioselective Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation, which may be considered as an evolution of Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, with a focus on the different chiral ligands and catalysts that enable these transformations.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the past decades, processes that involve transition&#8208;metal catalysis have represented a major part of synthetic tools. Recently, the interest shifted from the well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling reactions to C&#8211;H bond functionalization, thus making it a current frontier of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Constant progress in this field has led to the discovery of enantioselective methods to generate and control various types of stereogenic elements, thereby demonstrating its high value to generate scalemic chiral molecules. The present review is dedicated to enantioselective Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation, which may be considered as an evolution of Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, with a focus on the different chiral ligands and catalysts that enable these transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

More importantly, it also possesses excellent cycle stability to maintain 80.6% capacitance after 5000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device utilizing Mn0.1&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/NF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode attains a high energy density of 39.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 143.8 W kg&#8208;1 power density with a capacitance retention of 83.6% after 5000 cycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrolysis of Peptide Bonds in Protein Micelles Promoted by a Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Substituted Polyoxometalate as an Artificial Protease</title>
      <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of hydrophobic and unstructured proteins is difficult due to their poor solubility in aqueous solutions. This study demonstrates the ability of ZrIV&#8208;substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (Et2NH2)10[Zr(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] to promote selective hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;casein, an intrinsically unstructured protein consisting of 209 amino acids. The amphipathic nature of &#946;&#8208;casein causes it to assemble into large micelles, in which the hydrophilic part of the protein is solvent exposed and able to interact with Zr&#8208;POM that activates peptide bonds towards hydrolysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;N. Parac&#8208;Vogt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001920).

Eight pendant boranes are better than one for the activation of Lewis bases. A new diphosphine ligand that features four pendant borane groups has been prepared. The coordination chemistry of this new scaffold has been established using nickel&#8212;giving an octaboraneyl Ni0 complex; this species reacts readily with Lewis bases such as 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine.

      <title>The Missing Link in the Magnetism of Hybrid Cobalt Layered Hydroxides: The Odd&#8208;Even Effect of the Organic Spacer</title>
      <dc:description>A dramatic change in the magnetic behaviour that solely depends on the parity of the organic linker molecules has been found in a family of layered Co II hydroxides covalently functionalized with dicarboxylic molecules.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A dramatic change in the magnetic behaviour that solely depends on the parity of the organic linker molecules has been found in a family of layered Co II hydroxides covalently functionalized with dicarboxylic molecules. These layered hybrid materials have been synthesized at room temperature in one pot procedure through the &#8220;Epoxide Route&#8221;. While hybrids connected by odd alkyl chains exhibit coercive fields (H c ) below ca. 3500 Oe and show spontaneous magnetization at temperatures (T M ) below 20 K, hybrids functionalized with even alkyl chains behave as hard magnets with H c &amp;gt; 5500 Oe and display T M higher than 55 K. This intriguing behaviour was studied by density functional theory with the incorporation of a Hubbard term (DFT+U) calculations, unveiling the structural subtleties underlying this observation. Indeed, the different molecular orientation exhibited by the even/odd alkyl chains, and the orientation of the covalently linked carboxylic groups modify the intensity of the magnetic coupling of both octahedral and tetrahedral in&#8208;plane sublattices, thus strongly affecting the magnetic properties of the hybrid.

      <title>Control of Axial Chirality by Planar Chirality Based on Optically Active [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>Optically active X&#8208;shaped molecules based on the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane building block were prepared, in which di(methoxy)terphenyl units were stacked on the central benzene rings. At 25 &#176;C, anisolyl rings freely rotate in solution, while in the crystal form, they are fixed by intramolecular CH&#8208;&#960; interactions, thereby leading to the expression of the axial chirality, i.e., propeller chirality was exhibited by the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The X&#8208;shaped molecule exhibited good circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) profiles with moderate  &#934;  PL  and a large  g  lum  value in the order of 10  &#8211;3  at 25 &#176;C, in solution. In contrast, at &#8211;120 &#176;C, dual CPL emission with opposite signs was observed. According to the theoretical studies, the rotary motion of the anisolyl units is suppressed in the excited states, and so emission from two isomers could be observed. These results demonstrate that the axial chirality was controlled by the planar chirality, leading ultimately to propeller chirality.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational design of a&#160; Zn(II)&#8208;MOF with multiple functional sites for highly efficient fixation of CO2 at mild conditions: A combined experimental and theoretical investigation</title>

      <title>Bimetallic Rod&#8208;Packing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Combining Two Charged Forms of 2&#8208;Hydroxyterephthalic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Ordered heterometallic rod: A unique rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic framework features an unprecedented bimetallic rod with crystallographically distinguishable metal sites and two charged forms (&#8722;3 and &#8722;2) of the H3OBDC ligand. This new inorganic building block has the potential to generate high&#8208;density open&#8208;metal sites.







Abstract
Although many rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic frameworks are known, few are based on ordered heterometallic rod building unit. We show here the synthesis of CPM&#8208;76 based on an unprecedented Zn&#8208;Mg bimetallic rod with crystallographically distinguishable metal sites. The configuration of the rod offers two types of coordination site with trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral sites selectively occupied by Zn and Mg, respectively. Also unusual is the inter&#8208;connection mode between the rods, which is based on dual&#8208;charged forms (&#8722;3 and &#8722;2) of the 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalic acid (H3OBDC) ligand. Interestingly, each metal site in CPM&#8208;76 binds one solvent molecule, leading to a high density of solvent binding sites.

      <title>Control of intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer in deoxyadenosine&#8208;based fluorescent probes</title>
      <dc:description>In this paper, we report on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer ( PET) reaction between a donor (adenine analog) and an acceptor (3&#8208;methoxychromone dye,  3MC  ) in the context of designing efficient fluorescent probes as DNA sensors. Firstly, Gibbs energy was investigated in disconnected donor&#8208;acceptor systems by Rehm&#8208;Weller equation. The oxidation potential of the adenine derivative was responsible for exergonicity of the PET reaction in separated combinations. Then, the PET reaction in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugates was investigated using steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, acid&#8208;mediated PET inhibition and transient absorption techniques. In conjugated systems, PET is a favorable pathway of fluorescent quenching when an electron&#8208;rich adenine analog (  d7A  ) was connected to the fluorophore (  3MC  ). We found that formation of ground&#8208;state complexes even at nM concentration range dominated the dye photophysics and generated poorly emissive species likely through intermolecular PET from  d7A  to  3MC  . On the other hand, solution acidification disrupts complexation and turns on the dye emission. Bridging an electron&#8208;poor adenine analog with high oxidation potential (  8d7A  ) to  3MC  presenting low reduction potential is another alternative to prevent complex formation and produce highly emissive monomer conjugates.</dc:description>

      <title>Incorporate Boron into Uranium Metallacycles: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;containing Uranacycles Derived from Bis(alkynyl)boranes</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of uranacyclopropene complex (C 5 Me 5 ) 2 U[&#951; 2 &#8208;1,2&#8208;C 2 (SiMe 3 ) 2 ] with B&#8208;aryl bis(alkynyl)borane PhB(C&#8801;CPh) 2 led to the first six&#8208;membered uranium metallaboracycle, while the reaction with B&#8208;amino bis(alkynyl)borane (Me 3 Si) 2 NB(C&#8801;CPh) 2 afforded an unexpected uranaborabicyclo[2.2.0] complex via [2+2] cycloaddition. The reaction with CuCl revealed the non&#8208;innocent property of the rearranged bis(alkynyl)boron species towards oxidant. The reactions with isocyanide DippNC: (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr 2 &#8208;C 6 H 3 ) and isocyanate tBuNCO afforded the novel uranaborabicyclo[3.2.0] complexes. All new complexes have been structurally characterized. DFT calculations were performed to provide more insights into the electronic structures and the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynameric Collagen Self&#8208;healing Membranes with High Mechanical Strength for Effective Cell Grow Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The fabrication of biocompatible adaptive materials with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties for medical applications is a challenging endeavor. Collagen is a major&#160;extracellular matrix component acting as a substrate for cell adhesion and migration. Dynamers are constitutional polymers whose monomeric components are linked through reversible bonds, able to modify their constitution via reversible exchange of their components. In the current work, we demonstrate that the rational combination of collagen and dynameric networks connected with reversible covalent imine bonds is a very important and previously unreported strategy to provide biocompatible membranes with self&#8208;healing ability and excellent mechanical strength. The key challenge in the construction of such membranes is the interaction between collagen and the cross&#8208;linkers, preventing the formation of defects. For example, by varying structure and molecular lengths of the dynamers, the tensile strength of the dynameric membranes reach over 80 MPa, more than 400% higher than that observed of the reference collagen membrane and the highest value for break strain was recorded 19%. The self&#8208;healing property was observed when reconnecting two membrane pieces or even from crushed status of the membranes. Moreover, both MTT assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy method demonstrated the good biocompatibility of the collagen membranes, leaving more than 90% viability for NIH 3T3 cells after 24 h co&#8208;culture.</dc:description>

      <title>An assay for screening potential drug candidates for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease that act as chaperones of the Transthyretin&#160;and Amyloid&#8208;&#223;&#160;peptides interaction</title>

Abstract
A new series of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinines have been synthesized that contain different substituents both on the carbon backbone and the phosphorus atom of the six&#8208;membered heterocycle. Their optical and redox properties were studied in detail, supported by in&#8208;depth theoretical calculations. The modularity of the synthetic strategy allowed the establishment of structure&#8211;property relationships for this class of compounds and an OLED based on a blue phosphinine emitter could be developed for the first time.

      <title>Template&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Polyimidazolium Salts by Multiple [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyimidazolium cations: The octakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;5(BF4)8 has been obtained from two equivalents of tetrakisimidazolium salt H4&#8208;2(BF4)4 in a template synthesis via the tetranuclear octakis&#8208;NHC complex [Ag4(2)2] followed by postsynthetic irradiation and formation of four cyclobutane linkers between the two tetra&#8208;NHC ligands and demetallation. The binding of selected anions by H8&#8208;5(BF4)4 has been studied.







Abstract
The tetrakisimidazolium salt H4&#8208;2(Br)4, featuring a central benzene linker and 1,2,4,5&#8208;(nBu&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;Ph&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;) substituents reacts with Ag2O in the presence of AgBF4 to yield the tetranuclear, oktakis&#8208;NHC assembly [3](BF4)4. Cation [3]4+ features four pairs of olefins from the two tetrakis&#8208;NHC ligands perfectly arranged for a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition. Irradiation of [3](BF4)4 with a high pressure Hg lamp connects the two tetra&#8208;NHC ligands through four cyclobutane linkers to give compound [4](BF4)4. Removal of the template metals yields the novel oktakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;5(BF4)8. The tetrakisimidazolium salt H4&#8208;2(BF4)4 and the oktakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;5(BF4)8 have been used as multivalent anion receptors and their anion binding properties towards six different anions have been compared.

      <title>Enabling Control over Mechanical Conformity and Luminescence in Molecular Crystals: Interaction Engineering in Action</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular crystals of&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are of great interest as the highly ordered dense packing offers superior charge and exciton transport. However, integration into optoelectronic devices remains a major challenge due to its inherent brittle nature. Herein, we report the control over mechanical conformity in the single crystals of pyridine appended thiazolothizaole derivative by modulating the molecular packing through interaction engineering. Two polymorphs were prepared by achieving control over the thermodynamic/kinetic factors of crystallization, one of the polymorphs exhibits elastic bending while the other is brittle. The control over the bending ability was achieved by forming co&#8208;crystals with hydrogen/halogen bond donors. A seamless extended criss&#8208;cross pattern with respect to the bend plane through ditopic H&#8208;bonding motif showed the highest compliance towards elastic bending, while the co&#8208;crystals with a layered criss&#8208;cross arrangement with the segregated layers of co&#8208;formers exhibit slightly lower bending conformity. Our results update the rationale behind the plastic/elastic bending in molecular crystals. The co&#8208;crystals of ditopic halogen bond co&#8208;crystals are particularly appealing for waveguiding applications as the co&#8208;crystals blends high mechanical flexibility and luminescence properties. The hydrogen bond co&#8208;crystals are non emissive in nature due to excited state proton transfer dynamics. The rationale behind the fluorescence properties of these materials were also established from DFT calculations in a QM:MM framework.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular crystals of&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are of great interest as the highly ordered dense packing offers superior charge and exciton transport. However, integration into optoelectronic devices remains a major challenge due to its inherent brittle nature. Herein, we report the control over mechanical conformity in the single crystals of pyridine appended thiazolothizaole derivative by modulating the molecular packing through interaction engineering. Two polymorphs were prepared by achieving control over the thermodynamic/kinetic factors of crystallization, one of the polymorphs exhibits elastic bending while the other is brittle. The control over the bending ability was achieved by forming co&#8208;crystals with hydrogen/halogen bond donors. A seamless extended criss&#8208;cross pattern with respect to the bend plane through ditopic H&#8208;bonding motif showed the highest compliance towards elastic bending, while the co&#8208;crystals with a layered criss&#8208;cross arrangement with the segregated layers of co&#8208;formers exhibit slightly lower bending conformity. Our results update the rationale behind the plastic/elastic bending in molecular crystals. The co&#8208;crystals of ditopic halogen bond co&#8208;crystals are particularly appealing for waveguiding applications as the co&#8208;crystals blends high mechanical flexibility and luminescence properties. The hydrogen bond co&#8208;crystals are non emissive in nature due to excited state proton transfer dynamics. The rationale behind the fluorescence properties of these materials were also established from DFT calculations in a QM:MM framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enantioselective alkynylation of isatins: A combination of metal catalysis and organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>We have developed efficient and catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of isatins using a bifunctional amidophosphine&#8211;urea/AgBF  4  complex as the catalyst. By a combination of metal catalysis and organocatalysis, excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99%  ee  ) and good yields are achieved. A wide range of both terminal alkynes and isatins are tolerated by this new catalyst system, providing access to structurally diverse propargylic alcohols with tetrasubstituted stereogenic centers in high efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>How do metal ions modulate the rate&#8208;determining electron transfer step in Cytochrome P450 reactions?</title>
      <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes have important functions related to human health and their reaction rate is dependent on the first electron transfer from the reduction partner. &#160;Interestingly, experimental work showed that this&#160;step is highly affected by the addition of metal ions. &#160;To understand the effect of external perturbations on the CYP450 first reduction step, we performed a computational study with model complexes in the presence of metal and organic ions, solvent molecules and an electric field effect. &#160;The work shows that these medium&#8208;range interactions affect the driving force as well as electron transfer rates dramatically. &#160;Based on the location, distance and direction of the ions/electric field the reaction rate values are improved or impaired for catalysis. &#160;Calculations on a large crystal structure with alkali metal ions bound implicated inhibition patterns of the ions; therefore, we predict that active forms of the natural CYP450 isozymes will not have more than one alkali metal ions bound in the second&#8208;coordination sphere. &#160;As such the work gives insight into the activity of CYP450 enzymes and the effect of ions and electric field perturbations on its activity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This contribution describes the excited&#8208;state properties of an Osmium&#8208;complex when taken up into human cells.

To detail the sub&#8208;ns photophysics of 1, comparative transient absorption measurements were carried out in different solvents to derive a model of the photoinduced processes. Key to rationalize the excited&#8208;state relaxation is a long&#8208;lived 3ILCT state associated with the oligothiophene chain.

      <dc:description>The generation of different thermodynamically (meta)stable states is crucial for the development of smart solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. However, the design of luminophores with tunable aggregation states is remaining a grand challenge. Herein, we present a family of mechanochromic luminophores with tunable metastable states, based on the dynamically controllable &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of the flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of 2,5&#8208;diarylamino&#8208;terephthalates in the solid&#8208;state. The experimental data revealed that both the kinetically controlled metastable state and thermodynamic controlled stable state can be generated via tuning the intermolecular interactions such as &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonds. As a result, the highly sensitive mechano&#8208;stimuli response of these luminophores has been successfully achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Function&#8208;Topology Relationship in Catalytic Hydrolysis of Chemical Warfare Simulant inTwo Zr&#8208;MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>Due to the grate surface area, high concentration of active metal sites and water stability, zirconium(VI)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) have shown excellent activity for the hydrolysis of organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNs). In this regard, for the first time, two topologically different Zr&#8208;MOFs (Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc and Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc; build up from same organic and inorganic building blocks) were rationally chosen to investigate the effect of network topology on catalytic hydrolysis of nerve agent simulant, dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP). Remarkable enhancement in the DMNP hydrolysis rate was observed using Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc, reducing the half&#8208;life more than three times compared to Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc. Higher accessibility toward active Zr(VI) sites in 8&#8208;connected  bcu  net versus 12&#8208;connected  fcu  , lead to faster hydrolysis of DMNP on Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc. Intrestingly, the higher activity of Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc was also confirmed by its higher fluorescence sensitivity toward DMNP (LOD: 0.557 &#181;M) compared to Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc (LOD: 1.09 &#181;M). The results showed that dictating the desired topology in Zr&#8208;MOFs, is a useful strategy to improve their performance in catalytic detoxification and detection of OPNs.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the grate surface area, high concentration of active metal sites and water stability, zirconium(VI)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) have shown excellent activity for the hydrolysis of organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNs). In this regard, for the first time, two topologically different Zr&#8208;MOFs (Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc and Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc; build up from same organic and inorganic building blocks) were rationally chosen to investigate the effect of network topology on catalytic hydrolysis of nerve agent simulant, dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP). Remarkable enhancement in the DMNP hydrolysis rate was observed using Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc, reducing the half&#8208;life more than three times compared to Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc. Higher accessibility toward active Zr(VI) sites in 8&#8208;connected  bcu  net versus 12&#8208;connected  fcu  , lead to faster hydrolysis of DMNP on Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc. Intrestingly, the higher activity of Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc was also confirmed by its higher fluorescence sensitivity toward DMNP (LOD: 0.557 &#181;M) compared to Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc (LOD: 1.09 &#181;M). The results showed that dictating the desired topology in Zr&#8208;MOFs, is a useful strategy to improve their performance in catalytic detoxification and detection of OPNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Time Programmable Locking/Unlocking of the Calix[4]arene Scaffold by Means of Chemical Fuels</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report that 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid and its  p  &#8208;Cl,  p  &#8208;CH  3  and  p  &#8208;OCH  3  derivatives can be used as chemical fuels to control the geometry of the calix[4]arene scaffold in its cone conformation. It is shown that, under the action of the fuel, the cone calix[4]arene platform assumes a &#8220;locked&#8221; shape with two opposite aromatic rings strongly convergent and the other two strongly divergent (&#8220;pinched cone&#8221; conformation). Only when the fuel is exhausted, the cone calix[4]arene scaffold returns to its resting, &#8220;unlocked&#8221; shape. Remarkably, the duration of the &#8220;locked&#8221; state can be controlled at will by varying the fuel structure or amount. A kinetic study of the process shows that the consume of the fuel is catalyzed by the &#8220;unlocked&#8221; calixarene that behaves as an autocatalyst for its own production. A mechanism is proposed for the reaction of fuel consumption.</dc:description>

      <title>Crucial role of water in the mechanosynthesis of CsPbI3 and other ABX3 halides</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemical synthesis of CsPbI  3  , as a model system for ABX  3  halides, was studied. Water was shown to strongly promote the kinetics of formation of CsPbI  3  from the CsI+PbI  2  mixture through increased mobility of the constituting ionic species. Since many binary and ternary halides are hygroscopic, it was concluded that the presence of small, uncontrollable and unintentional additions of water should often occur in both precursor mixtures and synthesized complex halides boosting the kinetics of formation of many, if not all, ternary organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid halides such as, for example, MAPbX  3  (X=Cl, Br, I). In addition, trace amounts of water should influence the transport characteristics of complex halides. Thus, the presence of water explains, at least partially, the huge scatter in both the reported mechanochemical reaction times necessary for obtaining single&#8208;phase APbX  3  perovskite halides and the activation energies of ionic diffusion in APbX  3  .</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Introduction of an Alkylsulfonamido Group on C&#8208;sites of Isomeric Carboranes; the Influence of Stereochemistry on Inhibitory Activity Against Cancer&#8208;associated Carbonic Anhydrase IX Isoenzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CA IX), a tumor&#8208;associated metalloenzyme, represents a validated target for cancer therapy and diagnostics. Herein, we report the inhibition properties of isomeric families of sulfonamidopropyl&#8208;dicarba&#8208;  closo  &#8208;dodecaboranes group(s) prepared using a new direct five&#8208;step synthesis from the corresponding parent cages. The protocol offers a reliable solution for synthesis of singly and doubly substituted dicarba&#8208;  closo  &#8208;dodecaboranes with a different geometric position of carbon atoms. The  closo  &#8208; compounds from the  ortho  &#8208; and  meta  &#8208; series were then degraded to corresponding 11&#8208;vertex dicarba&#8208;  nido  &#8208;undecaborate(1&#8208;) anions. All the compounds show  in vitro  enzymatic activity against CA IX in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range. This is accompanied by clear isomer dependence of the inhibition constant (  K  i) and selectivity towards CA IX. Decreasing trends in  K  i and selectivity index (S  I  ) values are observed with increasing separation of the cage carbon atoms. Interactions of compounds with the active sites of CA IX were explored with X&#8208;ray crystallography, and eight high&#8208;resolution crystal structures uncovered the structural basis of inhibition potency and selectivity.</dc:description>
