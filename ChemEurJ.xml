         <title>Visible&#8208;light Enabled Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel visible&#8208;light photoredox strategy for the efficient dehydroxylative alkylation of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives using diaryl boron radical. The reaction features readily accessible starting materials, broad substrate scope with excellent functionality tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) process is responsible for the C&#8208;O bond activation, which is promoted by the diaryl boron radical generated from bench&#8208;stable and commercially available tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4).</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions for The Conformational Control of Urea</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed as a novel means for the conformational control of urea derivatives. The formation of a chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction at both sides of the urea carbonyl group was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as computational studies including&#160;non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) plot index analysis, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, and&#160;natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis via DFT calculations. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives that bear chalcogen atoms (X = S and Se) adopt a planar structure via the carbonyl oxygen (O) with an X&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;X arrangement on the same side of the molecule. The rigidity of the conformational lock was evaluated using the molecular arrangement in the crystal and the rotational barrier of benzochalcogenophene ring, which indicated a stronger conformational lock in benzoselenophene than in benzothiophene urea derivatives. Furthermore, the acidity of the urea derivatives increases according to the Lewis&#8208;acidic properties of the chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, whereby benzoselenophene urea is more acidic than benzothiophene urea. Tweezer&#8208;shaped urea derivatives were prepared, and their stereostructure proved the viability of the conformational control for defining the location of the substituents on the urea framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum(IV)&#8208;Gold(I) Agents with Promising Anticancer Activity. Selected Studies in 2D and 3D Triple Negative Breast Cancer Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New heterometallic binuclear and trinuclear platinum(IV)&#8208;gold(I) compounds of the type [Pt(L)nCl2(OH){(OOC&#8208;4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PPh2)AuCl}x] (L=NH3, n = 2; x = 1,2; L = diaminocyclohexane, DACH, n = 1; x = 2) are described. These compounds are cytotoxic and selective against a small panel of renal, bladder, ovarian and breast cancer cell lines. We selected a trinuclear PtAu2 compound containing the Pt(IV) core based on oxaliplatin, to further investigate its cell death pathway, cell and organelle uptake and anticancer effects against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cell line. This compound induces apoptosis and accumulates mainly in the nucleus and mitochondria. It also exerts remarkable antimigratory and antiangiogenic properties, and has a potent cytotoxic effect against TNBC 3D spheroids. Trinuclear compounds do not seem to display relevant interactions with calf thymus (CT) DNA and plasmid (pBR322) even in the presence of reducing agents, but inhibit pro&#8208;angiogenic enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in TNBC cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretched Central Double Bonds in Dialumene and Disilene by Amino Substituents: A Case of Lone Pair Repulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There have been remarkable advances in the syntheses and applications of groups 13 and 14 homonuclear ethene analogues. However, successes are largely limited to aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Analogues bearing two or more heteroatoms are still scarce. In this work, we employed the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents whose optimal geometries exhibit significantly stretched central M=M (M = Al or Si) double bonds compared with aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Computational analyses showed that the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond plays a critical role in the elongation of the M=M bonds. Evidently, replacing the substituent groups &#8208;NH2 with &#8208;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly scalable and inherently safer preparation of di, tri and tetra nitrate esters using continuous flow chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate esters are important organic compounds having wide application in energetic materials, medicines and fuel additives. They are synthesized through nitration of aliphatic polyols. But the process safety challenges associated with nitration reaction makes the production process complicated and economically unviable. Herein, we have developed a continuous flow process wherein polyol and nitric acid are reacted in a microreactor to produce nitrate ester continuously. Our developed process is inherently safe and efficient. The process was optimized for industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups. Molecules include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt; 90% in a short residence time of 1 min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt; 18 g/h/mL of reactor volume.</dc:description>

         <title>Isocyanides as Catalytic Electron Acceptors in the Visible Light Promoted Oxidative Formation of Benzyl and Acyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent disclosure of the ability of aromatic isocyanides to harvest visible light and act as single electron acceptors when reacting with tertiary aromatic amines has triggered a renewed interest in their application to the development of green photoredox catalytic methodologies. Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground&#8208;state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground&#8208; and the excited&#8208;state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provided key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide&#8208;based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry has been herein demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls, having immense applications in the pharmaceutical industry owing to their fascinating attributes and biological activity, have been exploited as versatile building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The recent advancement on assembly of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via different photochemical modes of reaction has been documented in this review.







Abstract
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15&#8197;years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes have been synthesized by fusing BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures. All the fused compounds have helical structures and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes show superior optical properties and high singlet&#8208;oxygen generation capacities that increase proportionally with their twisting angle.







Abstract
Designing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for the efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) that is proportional to their twisting angle. But their difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile in the visible spectral region restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT. On the other hand, boron&#8208;containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for their outstanding optical properties. However, planar BODIPY dyes has low ISC and thus they are not very effective as PDT agents. We have designed and synthesized fused compounds containing both BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures to develop red&#8208;shifted chromophores with efficient ISC. One of the pyrrole units of the BODIPY core was also replaced by a thiazole unit to further enhance the triplet conversion. All the fused compounds have helical structure, and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The helical structures of the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT structure optimization. The designed BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. This is the first report on the relationship between the twisting angle and the ISC efficiency in twisted BODIPY&#8208;based compounds. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances the ISC rate in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene, which is responsible for their high generation of singlet oxygen. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated, and one BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene showed efficient cancer cell killing upon photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for the future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.

         <title>Carbonylative Self&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Boronic Acids Using a Confined Pd Catalyst within Melamine Dendron and Fibrous Nano&#8208;Silica: A CO Surrogate Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A confined Pd/DN&#8208;DFNS as a heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized and used for the oxidative carbonylative synthesis of symmetric biaryl ketones from various aryl boronic acids using N&#8208;formyl saccharine as a C1 source. This catalytic system implies the recyclability of up to five consecutive cycles without loss of catalytic activity, is free of moisture&#8208;sensitive ligands and uses molecular oxygen as an oxidant and CuI as a co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Development of heterogeneous catalysts with tunable activity and selectivity has posed a persistent challenge. This study addresses this challenge by fabricating a hybrid environment through the combination of mesoporous silica and N&#8208;rich melamine dendron via covalent grafting, allowing for controllable growth and encapsulation of Pd NPs. This catalyst presented an excellent catalytic activity for the oxidative carbonylative self&#8208;coupling of aryl boronic acids to afford symmetric biaryl ketones using N&#8208;formyl saccharin as a sustainable solid CO source and Cu as a co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differences in the relative expression levels of cancer&#8208;related biomarker deliver key information about tumor progression. Herein, we developed a DNA windmill probe with four wind blades that could respond four mRNAs simultaneously and independently. The combination of four markers would present a superior picture for a particular cancer subtype, just like solving a jigsaw puzzle.







Abstract
Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in&#8197;situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.

The motions of an alkali cation from and to the crown&#8208;ether moieties of different ligands (up to three) is controlled over time and in a dissipative fashion by contextually employing two orthogonal stimuli, namely a radiative one and a chemical one. When the stimuli are no longer supplied, moving from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states, the system reversibly returns to its equilibrium state.







Abstract
The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of a different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.

When the stimuli are no longer supplied, moving from out-of-equilibrium states, the system reversibly returns to its equilibrium state.

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cards for improvement. Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were synthesized and found to display improved reactivity compared to the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. The stability and catalytic performance were generally improved by deuteration, though the improvement was structure dependent. In particular, an unexpectedly large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated catalyst.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.

         <title>Development of Fluorescent Isocoumarin&#8208;Fused Oxacyclononyne &#8211; 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pairs of isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN/1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were developed. The basis for creating IC9O&#8208;EWG is understanding the reason for the S1 state deactivation mechanism for their non&#8208;fluorescent analog IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies and eliminating this deactivation pathway through rational design.







Abstract
Fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes, which are reactive in SPAAC and give fluorescent triazoles regardless of the azide nature, have been developed. The key structural feature that converts the non&#8208;fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pair to its fluorescent counterpart is the pi&#8208;acceptor group (COOMe, CN) at the C6 position of the isocoumarin ring. The design of the fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pairs is based on the theoretical study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies. The calculations revealed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of the &#945;&#8208;pyrone cycle and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier could be increased by introducing a pi&#8208;acceptor group into a position that is in direct conjugation with the formed C=O group and has a reduced electron density in the transition state. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized two fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN bearing pi&#8208;acceptors at the C6 position. The importance of the nature of a pi&#8208;acceptor group was shown by the example of much less fluorescent CF3&#8208;substituted cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;CF3.

A game&#8208;changing generation of new protease assay substrates have been developed by using the nitrobenzofurazane (NBD) fluorophore. With applications across different protease classes, this breakthrough promises to decisively improve fluorometric assays in protease drug discovery.







Abstract
Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50&#8197;years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Herein, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.

A Lewis acid catalyzed cascade aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction and [3+3]/[4+2] cycloaddition reaction to access octahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[b]pyridin&#8208;6&#8208;one, octahydro&#8208;5,7a&#8208;epoxycyclopenta[cd]isoindol&#8208;4&#8208;one and decahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;dicyclopenta[cd,hi]isoindol&#8208;6&#8208;one skeletons.







Abstract
Cascade aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction and [3+3]/[4+2] cycloaddition reactions are carried out using the ideality principles of pot, atom, and step economy (PASE) synthesis. The reaction resulted in generation of octahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[b]pyridin&#8208;6&#8208;one scaffolds. Moreover, octahydro&#8208;5,7a&#8208;epoxycyclopenta[cd]isoindol&#8208;4&#8208;one frameworks of gracilamine alkaloid and a novel decahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;dicyclopenta[cd,hi]isoindol&#8208;6&#8208;one were also realized in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivities.

Platinum&#8208;based bioprobes! The cationic in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of anionic alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes via Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions to give low&#8208;energy red luminescence. By modulation of the self&#8208;assembly of the ensemble, new sensing strategies towards hydrogen peroxide and glucose were demonstrated.







Abstract
A new sensing strategy towards hydrogen peroxide based on metal coordination polyelectrolyte&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of alkynylplatinum(II) 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;yl)pyridine (bzimpy) complex was demonstrated. The cationic in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of anionic low&#8208;energy red&#8208;emissive alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes via non&#8208;covalent Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The presence of hydrogen peroxide was shown to inhibit the formation of coordination polyelectrolytes and the coordination polyelectrolyte&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of platinum(II) complexes. The weakening of Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions was supported by UV&#8208;vis absorption, emission, and resonance light scattering (RLS) studies. The present assay was also applied to probe glucose indirectly based on the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase on the substrate. Operating in a label&#8208;free manner, together with the low&#8208;energy red emission and large Stokes shift of alkynylplatinum(II) complexes, these features render the proposed design attractive for biological applications.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Co&#8208;Initiators via Base Catalysed Sequential Conjugate Addition: Application in Photoinduced Radical Polymerisation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applications of photochemistry are becoming very popular in modern&#8208;day life due to its operational simplicity, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable nature in comparison to its thermochemistry. In particular photoinduced radical polymerisation (PRP) reaction is finding more biological applications and especially in the areas of dental restoration process, tissue engineering and artificial bone generation. Type&#8208;II photoinitiator and co&#8208;initiator promoted PRP turned out to be a cost effective protocol, and herein we report the design and synthesis of a new efficient co&#8208;initiator for PRP reaction via barrierless sequential conjugate addition reaction. Experimental mechanistic observations were further complemented by computational data. Time for newly synthesised 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol (DTH) based co&#8208;initiator promoted polymerisation of diurethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, 70%) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, 30%) in presence of 450 nm LED (15 W) under the aerobic conditions was 38 seconds. High glass transition temperature, improved mechanical strength (860 BHN) and longer in&#8208;depth polymerisation (3 cm) was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Plant&#160;Dye for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach for aerobic methane (CH4) oxidation, but most current photocatalysts rely on metal centers. On the other hand, the excited states of many cost&#8208;effective organic photosensitizers have short lifetimes, which limits their interaction with CH4 for the reaction to occur. To overcome this, we utilized a pre&#8208;associated dye&#8208;Cl&#8208; complex with a short&#8208;lived excited state to efficiently generate active radical for CH4 conversion. By using an organic plant dye, alizarin (AQ), together with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and Cl&#8208;, we selectively converted CH4 to methyl (CH3TFA) and methylene ditrifluoroacetate (CH2(TFA)2) using molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant and visible light of 420 nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using affordable organic dyes and halide supramolecular chemistry for scalable CH4 photo&#8208;conversion, opening up exciting avenues for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Molecular Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Binaphthol Decorated Optically Innocent Cyclotriphosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features of BINOL&#8208;decorated cyclotriphosphazenes are reported for the very first time. The luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of these compounds in chloroform solutions and 1 % polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix are found to be 1.0 x 10&#8208;3, and 2.9 x 10&#8208;3, respectively. However, no CPL signal is observed for the pristine solids. The enantiomers (R/S) show ultraviolet photoluminescence (~ 350&#8208;360 nm) in solution and solid state. These compounds show ~ 10 times larger absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) than the simple BINOLs in the solutions state. In solid&#8208;state, cyclophosphazene&#8208;(R) shows larger PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(R); in contrast, (S)&#8208;enantiomer shows lower PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(S), which indicates that the isomer&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;state packing of these compounds plays a crucial role in controlling the PL. Thin films with more than 1 % doping concentration and pristine solids of these compounds do not show persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) due to concentration&#8208;caused quenching. However, thin films (1 % PMMA) of these chiral emitters exhibit pRTP characteristics with a lifetime of ~ 159&#8208;343 ms under vacuum. Detailed theoretical calculations reveal that the cyclophosphazene acts as an optically innocent dendritic core, and the optical features of these compounds are dictated by the pendent BINOL chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Milling Media&#8208;Free Suzuki Coupling by Direct Mechanocatalysis&#8208; From Mixer Mills to Resonant Acoustic Mixers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the development of a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective approach for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions in mechanochemistry. It is found that the substrate's impact with the vessel wall alone is sufficient to initiate the reaction, indicating that milling balls function primarily as a mixing agent for the direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki coupling. The absence of milling balls can be offset by adjusting the rheology using liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG). The LAG&#8208;sweet spot of 0.25 &#956;l/mg is confirmed for both resonance acoustic mixer (RAM) and ball&#8208;free mixer mills and is higher than in the presence of milling balls. The RAM exhibits excellent performance in the Suzuki reaction, achieving yields of 90% after 60 minutes and complete conversion after 90 minutes. The longevity of the milling vessel is significantly improved in the RAM, allowing for at least 20 reactions without deterioration.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heavier main group multiple bonds offer an effective tool for small molecule activation. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as a reactive phosphadiene system undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, including naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, and benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, affording concise access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with phosphorus at the bridgehead. These results demonstrate that non&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes are capable of acting as 2&#960; systems in [4+2] cycloaddition with highly reactive 2H&#8208;phosphindole complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photodynamic Activity of Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrins with and without Acetyl Protecting Groups on Cancer and Normal Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetylated 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin&#8208;&#955;&#8208;carrageenan complex had more selective intracellular uptakes and photodynamic activity of cancer cells toward normal cells than the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin&#8208;&#955;&#8208;carrageenan complex. Furthermore, the complex improved the photodynamic activity during in&#8197;vivo experiments owing to its high blood retention.







Abstract
Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (1) and tetrakis(4&#8208;acetamidophenyl)porphyrin (2) were dissolved in water with the incorporation of a polysaccharide (&#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CGN)) as a water&#8208;solubilizing agent. Although the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably lower than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex, the selectivity index (SI; IC50 in a normal cell/IC50 in a cancer cell) of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably higher than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex. This is because the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was significantly affected by the intracellular uptakes by the normal and cancer cells. During in&#8197;vivo experiments, the CGN&#8208;2 complex inhibited tumor growth under light irradiation with high blood retention compared with the CGN&#8208;1 complex and Photofrin, which exhibited lower blood retention. This study showed that the photodynamic activity and SI are influenced by substituent groups of arene in the meso&#8208;positions of porphyrin analogs.

         <title>Molecular Editing Enhances Oxidation Resistance of Menaquinone&#8208;Targeting Antibiotics Lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the oxidative stability of antibiotic lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2, we replaced the indole ring of their tryptophan residues with the benzofuran, benzothiophene, and 1&#8208;naphthalene rings. The synthetic 1&#8208;naphthalene analogues not only retained the original antibacterial activities, but also exhibited higher resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals.







Abstract
Lysocin E (1&#8201;a) and WAP&#8208;8294A2 (2&#8201;a) are peptidic natural products with 37&#8208; and 40&#8208;membered macrocycles, respectively. Compounds 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a have potent antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and share a unique mode of action. The electron&#8208;rich indole ring of d&#8208;Trp&#8208;10 of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a interacts with the electron&#8208;deficient benzoquinone ring of menaquinone, which is a co&#8208;enzyme in the bacterial respiratory chain. Formation of the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex causes membrane disruption, leading to cell death. Despite the promising activities of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, the susceptibility of Trp&#8208;10 to oxidative degradation potentially deters the development of these compounds as antibacterial drugs. To address this issue, we replaced the indole ring with more oxidation&#8208;resistant aromatics having a similar shape and electron&#8208;rich character. Specifically, analogues with benzofuran (1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b), benzothiophene (1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c), and 1&#8208;naphthalene (1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d) rings were designed, and chemically prepared by full solid&#8208;phase total syntheses. Antibacterial assays of the six analogues revealed similar activities of 1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d and markedly reduced activities of 1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b and 1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c compared with 1&#8201;a/2&#8201;a. Equipotent 1&#8201;d and 2&#8201;d both showed high resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. Hence, the present study demonstrates a new molecular editing strategy for conferring oxidation stability on natural products with pharmacologically useful functions.

The photocatalyzed reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system.







Abstract
The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Metallocene for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A more polished polyethylene: Covalent organic framework (COF) particles with hydroxy groups and well&#8208;defined micropores were synthesized and used as a novel carrier to load metallocene. The resulting supported catalyst, with a high specific surface area, demonstrated higher catalytic activity and better thermal tolerance during ethylene polymerization. It produced polyethylene with a higher molecular weight, increased crystallinity, and highly improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
The loading of homogeneous catalysts with support can dramatically improve their performance in olefin polymerization. However, the challenge lies in the development of supported catalysts with well&#8208;defined pore structures and good compatibility to achieve high catalytic activity and product performance. Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material&#8212;covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst&#8212;Cp2ZrCl2 for ethylene polymerization. The COF&#8208;supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 140&#8201;&#176;C, compared with 11.2&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&#208;) after COF supporting, that is, Mw increases from 160 to 308&#8197;kDa and &#208; drops from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (Tm) is also increased by up to 5.2&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 to 30.7&#8197;MPa and elongation at break from 350 to 1400&#8201;% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for highly efficient olefin polymerization and high&#8208;performance polyolefins.

Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material&#8212;covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst&#8212;Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ethylene polymerization. The COF-supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;g&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 140&#8201;&#176;C, compared with 11.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;g&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight-average molecular weight (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#208;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) after COF supporting, that is, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; increases from 160 to 308&#8197;kDa and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#208;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; drops from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) is also increased by up to 5.2&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 to 30.7&#8197;MPa and elongation at break from 350 to 1400&#8201;% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for highly efficient olefin polymerization and high-performance polyolefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) is widely used to determine chirality especially by employing porphyrins as reporter chromophores. The artwork, designed by Natalja Jemikova, shows a supramolecular complex of a porphyrin with two chiral guest molecules being irradiated to measure ECD and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. However, the electronic mechanism of induced ECD in the porphyrin has yet to be comprehensively rationalized, and computational chemistry can be successfully applied for this purpose. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Osadchuk, M.&#8197;O. Senge and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301408).

         <title>Nucleophile&#8208;Triggered &#960;&#8208;Topological Transformation: a New Synthetic Approach to Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Rhodamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a&#160;&#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor). In contrast to conventional NIR&#8208;emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated&#160;PeR Fluor&#160;can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure.&#160;PeR Fluor&#160;exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative&#160;&#960;&#8208;electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the&#160;N&#8208;substituted group to obtain NIR&#8208;absorbing/emitting&#160;PeR Fluor. We also demonstrate the stimulus&#8208;responsive functionality of&#160;PeR Fluor&#160;through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our&#160;&#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>A bifunctional coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework for quantitative enantioselective sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective sensing is highly crucial and challenging due to the highly similar physical/chemical properties of enantiomers which may have different chemical impact on organism. Luminescent coordination compounds have attracted great attention as sensing materials based on their controllable chemical and electric structures that can be highly matched with the targeted species. To achieve high&#8208;performance enantioselective sensing, the direct synthesis of chiral and luminescent bifunctional coordination compounds is a rational way but highly challenging due to the price and synthesis difficulty. Herein, an anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied as a host to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers via a facile cation exchange reaction, affording a bifunctional framework that possesses enantioselective sensing properties for the mixture of enantiomers. This study paves a pathway for constructing multifunctional coordination chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for rapidly enantioselective sensing function.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl Chains Modulated Magnetization Dynamics of Mononuclear Trigonal Prismatic CoII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four benzeneboron&#8208;capped mononuclear CoII complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The CoII ions are all wrapped by the pocket&#8208;like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the CoII complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single&#8208;molecule magnets.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Functionalized Lacunary Double Cubane Type Oxometallates: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (M = Co, Zn)</title>

         <dc:description>Organofunctionalized tetranuclear clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (1, M = Co; 2, M = Zn) containing an unprecedented oxometallacyclic {M2V2Cl2N4O8} (M = Co, Zn) framework are prepared by solvothermal reactions. The new oxo&#8208;alkoxide compounds are fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab&#8208;initio computational methods, and complete single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis. &#160;The isostructural clusters are formed of edge&#8208;sharing octahedral {VO5N} and trigonal bipyramidal {MO3NCl} units.

The new oxo-alkoxide compounds are fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab-initio computational methods, and complete single crystal X-ray diffraction structure analysis. &#160;The isostructural clusters are formed of edge-sharing octahedral {VO5N} and trigonal bipyramidal {MO3NCl} units.

         <title>Emissive Click Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of cofacial organic cage molecules containing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) through four&#8208;fold Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) &#8220;click&#8221; reactions. The shorter AIEgen tetraphenylethylene (TPE) afforded two orientational isomers. The longer building blocks of tetrabiphenylethylene (TBPE) afforded a single isomer. The click reaction employed is irreversible, yet it yields remarkable four&#8208;fold click products above 40%. The phenyl rings around the ethylene core generate propeller&#8208;shaped chirality owing to their orientation, which influences the chirality of the resulting cages. The shorter cages are a mixture of PP/MM isomers, while the longer ones are a mixture of PM/MP isomers, at least in the solid state. The newly synthesized cage molecules were emissive even in dilute solutions (THF) and exhibited enhanced AIE upon the addition of water. Upon aggregation in aqueous solution, the organic cage molecules exhibit turn&#8208;off emission sensing of nitroaromatic explosives with selectivity for picric acid in 25&#8208;38 nanomolar detection range.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of C2Al4&#8722;/0 and C2Al5&#8722;/0 was conducted using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. Our findings reveal that C2Al4&#8722; has a boat&#8208;like structure, with a single C2 unit surrounded by four aluminum atoms. In contrast, the neutral C2Al4 species adopts a D2h planar structure with two planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) units, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the global minimum isomer of C2Al5&#8722; adopts a D3h symmetry, where the C2 unit interacts with five aluminum atoms. We also found that a lower symmetry structure of C2Al5&#8722;, where all five aluminum atoms are located on the same side of the C2 unit, albeit slightly higher in energy compared to the D3h structure. Our computations show that the D3h structure of C2Al5&#8722; is highly stable, exhibiting a large HOMO&#8722;LUMO gap.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of the Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomer tBuHPBH2NMe3 (2a) with catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5:&#951;1&#8208;adamantylidenepentafulvene)titanium (1) provides a convenient new route to the polyphosphinoborane [tBuPH&#8208;BH2]n (3a). This method offers access to high molar mass materials under mild conditions and with short reaction times (20 &#176;C, 1 h in toluene). It represents an unprecedented example of a transition metal&#8208;mediated polymerization of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized Group 13/15 compound.

         <title>Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional pi&#8208;systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self&#8208;sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Herein, we establish that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (PE) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (BODIPY) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of BODIPY is 50% in the BODIPY&#8208;PE mixture, the 1D polymerization of PE is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle&#8208;like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8208;6. The addition of 75% of BODIPY to PE resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8208;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of PE monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time&#8208;resolved emission studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the formazanate potassium salt [LtBuK(thf) (LtBu = PhNNC(4&#8208;tBuPh)NNPh) with the group 14 chlorotetrylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}ECl] (E = Si, Ge, Sn) was investigated. Three corresponding compounds with unique configurations were formed, demonstrating the diverse reactivity of the system. In addition to the anticipated salt metathesis reactions of the potassium salt with the chlorine function of tetrylenes, unexpected reduction/insertion steps into the N=N bond of the formazanate (Si, Ge) and subsequent C&#8722;H activation (Ge) were also observed. Furthermore, when the neutral formazan ligand [LtBuH] was exposed to silylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}SiCl] and [LPhSiNMePy], substitution and addition reactions occurred. These discoveries significantly enrich the diversity of formazanate/formazan redox chemistry, opening up new avenues for exploration in this field.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional groups that allow for chemoselective and bioorthogonal derivatization are valuable tools for the labelling of peptides and proteins. The isonitrile is such a group but synthetic methods for its incorporation into peptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis are not known. Here, we introduce (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;isonitrileproline (Inp) as building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Conformational studies of (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;Inp and thermal stability analysis of Inp&#8208;containing collagen triple helices revealed that the isonitrile group exerts a stereoelectronic gauche effect. We showcase the value of Inp for bioorthogonal labelling by derivatization of Inp&#8208;containing collagen model peptides (CMPs). Dual labelling with a pair of bioorthogonal reactions of a CMP containing Inp and azidoproline residues further highlights the versatility of the new isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;degradable Crosslinker for the Development of Light&#8208;responsive Protocell Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The achievement of light&#8208;responsive behaviours is an important target for protocell engineering to allow control of fundamental protocellular processes such as communication via diffusible chemical signals, shape changes or even motility at the flick of a switch. As a step towards this ambitious goal, here we describe the synthesis of a novel poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive towards nucleophiles, that effectively degrades with UV light (405 nm). We demonstrate its utility for the fabrication of the first protocell membranes capable of light&#8208;induced disassembly, for the photo&#8208;generation of patterns of protocells, and for the modulation of protocell membrane permeability. Overall, our results not only open up new avenues towards the engineering of spatially organised, communicating networks of protocells, and of micro&#8208;compartmentalised systems for information storage and release, but also have important implications for other research fields such as drug delivery and soft materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous decoration of Ultrasmall Pt Nanoparticles on size&#8208;separated MoS2 nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid exfoliation can be considered as a viable approach for scalable production of 2D materials due to its various benefits, although the polydispersity in the obtained nanosheet size hinders their straightforward incorporation. Size&#8208;separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size&#8208;specific applicability. Herein, size&#8208;selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation&#8208;based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size&#8208;activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets was evaluated for hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Free, Self&#8208;repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid&#8208;free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE&#8208;2) was synthesized and studied. The polyurethane (PU) type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE&#8208;2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE&#8208;2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &gt; 89%, 400~800 nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06 MPa, elongation at break of 1760%, and fracture energy of 14.98 kJ/m2), appreciable self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency &gt; 90%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE&#8208;2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro&#8208;expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human&#8208;machine interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Infrared Star: being at a glance.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth polycations have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their extraordinary and counter&#8208;intuitive structures and stoichiometries. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, our understanding of the bonding in such clusters remains insufficient. In this study, we conducted an AdNDP bonding analysis to elucidate the bonding characteristics using both homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters with various stoichiometries. By analyzing the calculated nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift data, we confirmed the aromatic nature of these species. We identified some universal bonding patterns that can be applied to a range of homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters. Additionally, we performed calculations of absorbance and fluorescence spectra to gain insights into the near&#8208;infrared emission and establish a potential correlation between absorbance and the identified bonding patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;covalent Supramolecular 1D Alternating Copolymer in Crystal toward 2D Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#8208;ordered supramolecular structures composed of light&#8208;emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, we designed a bipyridyl&#8208;appended acrylonitrile&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule 1, which produced a 1D supramolecular polymer constructed through non&#8208;covalent bonding between a lone pair in 1 and a &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene 2. The 1D copolymer of 1 and 2 is aligned horizontally with the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non&#8208;covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the 2D surface. Compared with the loss coefficient &#945;L =52dBcm&#8208;1 for the long&#8208;axis direction of the 2D platelet cocrystal, a very large difference of &#945;S =2111dBcm&#8208;1 is present in the crystal short&#8208;axis direction. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported 2D platelet crystal waveguides. This supramolecular synthon provides an approach to designing anisotropic photon transporters and highly regulated optical logic circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Independent Ultrafast Energy Transfer in Bioinspired Arrays Containing Electronically Coupled BODIPY Dimers&#160;as Energy Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting complexes, strong interaction between chromophores enables efficient absorption of solar radiation and has been suggested to enable ultrafast energy funneling to the reaction center. To examine whether similar effects can be realized in synthetic systems, and to determine the mechanisms of energy transfer, we synthesized and characterized a series of bioinspired arrays containing strongly&#8208;coupled BODIPY dimer as energy donors and chlorin derivatives as energy acceptors. The BODIPY dimer feature broad absorption in the range of 500 &#8211; 600 nm, complementing the chlorin absorption to provide absorption across the entire visible spectrum. Ultrafast (~10 ps) energy transfer was observed from photoexcited BODIPY dyads to chlorin subunits. Surprisingly, the energy&#8208;transfer rate is nearly independent of the position where the BODIPY dimer is attached to the chlorin and of the type of connecting linker. In addition, the energy&#8208;transfer rate from BODIPY dimers to chlorin is slower than the corresponding rate in arrays containing BODIPY monomers. The lower rate, corresponding to less efficient through&#8208;bond transfer, is most likely due to weaker electronic coupling between the ground state of the chlorin acceptor and the delocalized electronic state of the BODIPY dimer, compared to the localized state of a BODIPY monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Regime Switch in the Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Silicates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallaphotoredox catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an arylbromide (Ar&#8208;Br) with an alkyl bis&#8208;catecholato silicate (R&#8208;Si&#8854;) has been analyzed in depth using a continuum of analytical techniques (EPR, fluorine NMR, electrochemistry, photophysics) and modeling (micro&#8208;kinetics and DFT calculations). These studies converged on the impact of four control parameters consisting in the initial concentrations of the iridium photocatalyst ([Ir]0), nickel precatalyst ([Ni]0) and silicate ([R&#8208;Si&#8854;]0) as well as light intensity I0 for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8208;Br and R&#8208;Si&#8854;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8208;Br with R&#8208;Si&#8854; smoothly leading to Ar&#8208;R, with no side&#8208;product from R&#8208;Si&#8854; and a second one in which R&#8208;Si&#8854; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8208;Br and degraded to R&#8208;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;acceptor activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Hetero&#8208;Pnictogen Diazonium Analogs Stabilized by Transition Metal Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;PE)] (E&#160;=&#160;P,&#160;As,&#160;Sb) towards different group 14 electrophiles is reported. The resulting library of cationic compounds [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;EPR)]+ (R = Mes (2,4,6&#8208;C6H2Me3), CH3, CPh3, SnMe3) represents formally inorganic diazonium homologs which are stabilized by transition metal units. Modifying the steric and electronic properties of the electrophile drastically impacts the respective P&#8208;R bond lengths and is accompanied by increasing (SnMe3&gt;CPh3&gt;CH3) the dynamic behavior in solution. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied organic analogs, the prepared compounds are stable at room temperature. The subsequent reaction of the model substrate [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#181;,&#951;2:2&#8208;P2Me)][OTf] ([OTf]&#8208; = [CF3SO3]&#8208;) with different N&#8209;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) leads to an addition at the unsubstituted P atom which is also predicted by computational methods. NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation of two isomers sync/gauche&#8208;[{CpMo(CO)2}(&#956;,&#951;2:1&#8208;P(NHC)PMe){CpMo(CO)2}][OTf]. X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization and additional DFT calculations shed light on the spatial arrangement as well as on the possible formation pathways of the isomers.</dc:description>

The synthesis of these derivatives has made significant progress since 2010, with some novel, efficient, and green methods developed using various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic systems from acyclic or cyclic substrates.







Abstract
3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes are an important class of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles that have been found to be key structural features in a wide range of biologically active natural products, drugs, and agrochemicals. As a cutting&#8208;edge area, the synthesis of these derivatives has made spectacular progress in recent decades, with various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic systems being developed.

         <dc:description>
A formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A, a neo clerodane diterpenoid natural product and &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor agonist, is being reported utilizing a double application of gold(I) methodology as a Lewis acid and a photoredox catalyst.

The formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;salvinorin A is presented. Our approach utilizes two distinct gold(I) catalytic processes. The combination of a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed photoredox reaction generated in eight steps the framework of the natural product with high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;Based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotaxane! Utilizing the Lewis basic carbonyl moieties of the squaramide motif, a series of squaramide&#8208;containing heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are synthesized via sodium&#8208;cation templation. 1H&#8197;NMR binding studies reveal the bromide and iodide recognition capabilities of these heteroditopic receptors are significantly enhanced by up to ca. 20&#8208;fold in the presence of co&#8208;bound sodium cations, highlighting the unique ambidentate ion&#8208;pair binding nature of squaramides.







Abstract
A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesized using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.

         <title>2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;Based Recyclable Electroauxiliaries for the Generation of Alkyl Radicals via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;based electroauxiliaries have successfully been developed as suitable reagents for the site&#8208;selective generation of alkyl radicals. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals could be generated and several free radical reactions could be studied. The platform has the advantage of recyclability, which makes these alkyl radical precursors superior compared to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.







Abstract
Alkyl radical precursors are essential for a wide variety of photocatalytic and 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Neutral organic heterocycles as electroauxiliaries such as 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters have become reliable tools for alkyl radical formation. Here we show that 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline&#8208;derived alkyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinolines act as competent radical precursors with the ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals. Hydroalkylation of benzalmalononitriles and N&#8208;Boc protected diazenes has been achieved through copper catalysis under mild conditions of 50&#8201;&#176;C with good to very good yields of up to 85&#8201;%. Furthermore, the dihydroquinolines&#8217; reactivity towards a denitrative alkylation of nitroolefins such as &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene was discovered. Most importantly, the released biquinoline can be recycled, which greatly improves the overall atom&#8208;economy of these alkyl radical precursors in comparison to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208; and difluorination of azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine reduces basicity (pKa) and modulates lipophilicity (LogP) while retaining metabolic stability (CLint) in nearly all cases. Analysis of the obtained physicochemical data provides a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compounds&#8217; properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound's basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.&#8201;e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, preferring a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.&#8201;g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.

         <title>Catalysis by KDM6 Histone Demethylases &#8211; A Synergy between the Non&#8208;Heme Iron(II) Center, Second Coordination Sphere, and Long&#8208;Range Interactions</title>

The study of the effects of SCS and LR residues at each intermediate level of the demethylation mechanism in the catalysis of KDM6 enzymes using QM/MM and MD simulations.







Abstract
KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone&#8197;H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. A Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B reveals that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4, KDM6B and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved. KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A. The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long&#8208;range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular catalyst transfer takes place on dibromobenzotriazole, but not on dibromobenzothiadiazole in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction and polycondensation reaction with tBu3PPd precatalyst. Furthermore, the addition of benzothiadiazole interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reaction of dibromophenylene with phenylboronic acid ester, in which the catalyst transfer occurs in the absence of any additive.







Abstract
Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3&#8197;equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.

&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PPd precatalyst. Furthermore, the addition of benzothiadiazole interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reaction of dibromophenylene with phenylboronic acid ester, in which the catalyst transfer occurs in the absence of any additive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3&#8197;equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediboronates afforded high-molecular-weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediboronates afforded moderate-molecular-weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low-molecular-weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking The Role of Guanidinium Salts in Interface Engineering for Boosted Performance of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial passivation of Guanidinium salts for inverted perovskite solar cells was systematically investigated. With the optimal benefit by reduced defects, the efficiency of 19.95&#8201;% is achieved for GuABr&#8208;modified solar cells with superior stability, which maintains 90&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1600&#8197;h under a relative humidity of 35&#8201;%&#8211;55&#8201;% for unencapsulated devices.







Abstract
NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large&#8208;scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge&#8208;extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr&#8208;treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600&#8197;h at 16&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and 35&#8201;%&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials are reported. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The sodium ionic conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention, and chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in such batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8722;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence Mo species acts as Lewis acid sites to activate aldehyde groups and deliver strong metal&#8208;support interactions to enable metallic Pd centers toward the boosted amination of furfural with a high yield of 84&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8722;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8722;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8722;x supports can be easily ameliorated by varying the preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8722;x and highly dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84&#8201;%) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8722;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.

@A_Le_Goff Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes (Le Goff**et al.).







Abstract
The immobilization of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (NiR) from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes is reported. It is demonstrated that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.

1,3&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;isoindoles have been synthesized by a cascade reaction of divinyl ethers, which are derived from easily available 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins, with substituted anilines in HFIP. This cascade reaction consists of a ring&#8208;opening step through addition&#8208;elimination mechanism and the following 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet type ring&#8208;closing step via the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. Thus obtained 2H&#8208;isoindoles have been derivatized to high&#8208;order nitrogen&#8208;containing polycycles including less accessible benzo[a]ullazines.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old, limited data in the nuclear field is relied upon, but often requires revisiting for clarity. Like cracked glasses, flaws in old data can lead to missing information. Structural assumptions about PuIV oxalate hexahydrate have existed for decades, but only now has the structure been reported. These data have led to the identification of previously unreported coordination of water and changing oxalate positions across the isostructural AnIV series. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Sockwell, A.&#8197;E. Hixon and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301164).

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Sn&#8208;Based Enantiomeric Phase Transition Materials with High&#8208;Tc and Dielectric Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of chirality and phase transition materials has broad application prospects. Therefore, based on the quasi&#8208;spherical theory and the thought strategy of introducing chirality, we have successfully synthesized a pair of chiral enantiomeric ligand R/S&#8208;triethyl (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;propyl) ammonium iodide, which can be combined with tin hexachloride anion to obtain a pair of new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase transition materials: R/S&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which has a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384 K, crystallized in P21 chiral space group at room temperature, and has obvious CD signal. In addition, compound 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S also has good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap. This work is conducive to the research of chiral high&#8208;temperature reversible plastic phase transition materials, and promotes the development of multi&#8208;functional phase transition materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Modeling Reactivity of Nitrite and Nitrous Acid at a Phenolate Bridged Dizinc(II) Site: Insights into NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at various transition metals including Fe and Cu are relatively well explored, examples of such a reaction at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) site are limited. The present report aims to gain insights into the reactivity of nitrite anion, nitrous acid (HONO), and organonitrite (RONO) at a dizinc(II) site. A phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II)&#8208;aqua complex [LHZnII(OH2)]2(ClO4)2&#160;(1H&#8208;Aq, where&#160;LH&#160;= tridentate N,N,O&#8208;donor monoanionic ligand) is illustrated to react with&#160;tBuONO to provide a metastable arene&#8208;nitrosonium charge&#8208;transfer complex&#160;2H. UV&#8208;vis, FTIR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses suggests the presence of a&#160;2:1&#160;arene&#8208;nitrosonium&#160;moiety. Furthermore, the reactivity of a structurally characterized zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex [LHZnII(ONO)]2&#160;(1H&#8208;ONO) with a proton&#8208;source demonstrates HONO reactivity at the dizinc(II) site. Reactivity of both RONO&#160;(R = alkyl/H)&#160;at the phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II) site provides NO+&#160;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#160;2H. Subsequently, the reactions of&#160;2H&#160;with exogenous reductants (such as ferrocene, thiol, phenol, and catechol) have been illustrated to generate NO. In addition, NO yielding reactivity of [LHZnII(ONO)]2&#160;(1H&#8208;ONO) in the presence of above&#8208;mentioned reductants have been&#160;compared with the reactions of complex&#160;2H. Thus, this report sheds light on the transformations of&#160;NO2&#8211;/RONO (R = alkyl/H) toNO/NO+&#160;at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) coordination motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Reexamining the Emergence and Stability of the Square Cylinder Phase in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from the square cylinder phase to the rectangular cylinder phase is a second&#8208;order transition that accompanies the transition of the free&#8208;energy landscape from one minimum to two minima. The prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the B1A1B2A2B3 copolymer.







Abstract
Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in 
 linear pentablock and 
 star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the 
 copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.

         <title>Polymer Nanoantidotes</title>

Polymer nanoantidotes implement the detoxification process through three different patterns, physical interaction, chemical bonding, and biomimetic clearance, and their significant efficacy speculates on the opportunities for clinical application.







Abstract
Intoxication is one of the most common causes of accidental death globally. Although some antidotes capable of neutralizing the toxicity of certain xenobiotics have become well established, the current reality is that clinicians primarily rely on nonspecific extracorporeal techniques to remove toxins. Nano&#8208;intervention strategies in which nanoantidotes neutralize toxicity in&#8197;situ via physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance have begun to show clinical potential. However, most nanoantidotes remain in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, and the difficulty of constructing clinical relevance models and the unclear pharmacokinetics of nanoantidotes hinder their translation to clinic. This Concept reviews the detoxification mechanisms of polymer nanoantidotes and predicts the opportunities and challenges associated with their clinical application.

Nano-intervention strategies in which nanoantidotes neutralize toxicity in&#8197;situ via physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance have begun to show clinical potential. However, most nanoantidotes remain in the proof-of-concept stage, and the difficulty of constructing clinical relevance models and the unclear pharmacokinetics of nanoantidotes hinder their translation to clinic. This Concept reviews the detoxification mechanisms of polymer nanoantidotes and predicts the opportunities and challenges associated with their clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity Differences of Trigonal Pyramidal Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo and Iron(III)&#8208;Oxo Complexes: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental and computational studies show iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes can abstract hydrogen atoms from toluene efficiently, but thermochemically fail to do OH rebound and as such tolyl radicals are released and react separately. As a consequence iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo generate different products in a reaction with toluene.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Beyond the Limits of Atropochirality: Design of Highly Conformationally Restrained Biaryls with Bridgehead Phosphine Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropochirality in 2,2&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted biaryls is a long&#8208;standing quest, and only the bulkiest substituents slow down their rotation. However, a new and rigid bicyclic scaffold has recently been developed. This scaffold has successfully pushed the limits of atropochirality even with substituents as small as fluorine atom. By using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT computational studies, insights about the mechanism of isomerisation were gained.







Abstract
In the last three decades, reacting sterically congested ortho&#8208;substituted arenes to form atropochiral biaryls is an appealing venture and a challenging subject that has garnered significant attention. Therefore, there is interest in developing methods to prepare these compounds. In this study, an efficient approach to produce a new class 2,2&#8217; disubstituted biaryls bridgehead phosphine oxides with an unusual topology and exceptional conformational stability is presented. Our methodology demonstrates that depending on the substitution pattern on the aryl moieties, the methanophosphocine backbone could be rigid enough to observe a double atropochirality, resulting in an under covered class of molecules. Notably, our studies revealed that replacing only one hydrogen at the ortho position by a fluorine atom led to sufficiently restricted rotation at temperatures below 80&#8201;&#176;C, extending &#8220;far away&#8221; the limits of atropostability. Finally, our investigations, which employed variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, yielded unique insights into the isomerisation mechanism, indicating that the two biaryl motifs are fully independent in spite of their proximity.

         <title>Foldamer Nanotubes Mediated Label&#8208;Free Detection of Protein&#8208;Small Molecule Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>

Label free detection of protein&#8208;small molecule interactions mediated by the helical peptide nanotubes using impedance spectroscopy is reported. This method can be used to detect interactions of protein and small molecules at very low concentrations.







Abstract
Development of miniaturized lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip devices for the detection of rapid and specific small molecule&#8208;protein binding interactions at very low concentrations holds significant importance in drug discovery and biomedical applications. Here, the label&#8208;free detection of small molecule&#8208;protein interactions is reported on the surface functionalizable nanotubes of &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide helical foldamers using nanoscale capacitance and impedance spectroscopy. The 12&#8208;helix conformation of the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid peptide observed in the single crystals, self&#8208;assembled into nanotubes in an aqueous environment with exposed cysteine thiols for small molecule conjugation. The binding of streptavidin to the covalently linked biotin on the surface of nanotubes was detected at the picomolar concentrations. No change in the capacitance and impedance were observed in the absence of either immobilized biotin or protein streptavidin. The functionalizable hybrid peptide nanotubes reported here pave the way for the label&#8208;free detection of various small molecule protein interactions at very low concentrations.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Sonogashira Coupling for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle&#8208;mediated Sonogashira reaction between on&#8208;DNA (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides and (hetero)aryl or aliphatic terminal alkynes. The methodology shows broad substrate scope in terms of both coupling partners and we demonstrate that the methodology is fully compatible with library synthesis protocols and DNA encoded and decoding. This methodology will enable the synthesis of alkynyl(hetero)biaryls or it could be used for subsequent derivatization to alternative products, such as the corresponding alkane or heterocycles.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug&#8208;like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on&#8208;DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.

         <title>Rapid Chemical Synthesis of Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal&#8208;type 13 (SPINK13) Glycoform by a Combined Method with Glycan Insertion Strategy and Fast&#8208;Flow Fmoc SPPS

         <dc:description>
Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.







Abstract
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro&#8208;Asn&#8208;Val&#8208;Thr) for N&#8208;glycosylation, the existence of N&#8208;glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N&#8208;glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast&#8208;flow SPPS method.

&lt;p&gt;Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro-Asn(N-glycan)-Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast-flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast-flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro-Asn-Val-Thr) for N-glycosylation, the existence of N-glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N-glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast-flow SPPS method. Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments where is the sterically bulky Pro-Asn(N-glycan)-Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). This insertion strategy successfully afforded the full-length polypeptide of SPINK13 within two steps from glycosylated asparagine thioacid. Because the two peptides used for this synthesis were prepared by a fast-flow SPPS, the total synthetic time of glycoprotein was considerably shortened. This synthetic concept enables us to repetitively synthesize a target glycoprotein easily. Folding experiments afforded well-folded structure confirmed by CD and disulfide bond map. Invasion assays of glycosylated SPINK13 and non-glycosylated SPINK13 with pancreatic cancer cells showed that non-glycosylated SPINK-13 was more potent than that of glycosylated SPINK13.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Zn+2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dicationic Zn&#8208;based complex was synthesized and found to be a highly selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkynes. Remarkably, this complex could selectively catalyze the hydrosilylation of alkynes even in the presence of alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrosilylation of C=C double and C&#8801;C triple bonds is one of the most widely used processes in organosilicon chemistry, mostly catalyzed by Pt&#8208;based complexes. Herein, the synthesis of a dicationic Zn+2&#8208;based complex with a tripodal tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand is reported which was found to be a highly chemoselective catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of alkynes. Mechanistic studies revealed that unlike typical Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions where the key step is the activation of the Si&#8722;H bond, this system catalyzes the hydrosilylation reaction through the activation of C&#8801;C triple bonds, which presumably is the reason for its high chemoselectivity. Remarkably, the hydrosilylation of alkynes could be performed in the presence of alkenes and other functional groups that remained intact in this reaction.

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable salts of unsubstituted radical cations of anthracene, tetracene and pentacene were isolated in the condensed phase by deelectronation of the respective neutral acenes. The radical cation salts were structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized (IR, Raman, UV&#8208;Vis, EPR).







Abstract
The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in&#8197;situ, i.&#8201;e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10&#8197;K. In this study, room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordinating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=&#8722;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordinating solvent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) were prepared and structurally, electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized. Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent,[54] to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent[54] deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal=9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoroanthracene; acene=anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclovoltammetric measurements of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with 
 Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.

This study unveils the substrate promiscuity of acyltransferase LovD9, which turns to be very efficient by accepting vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl derivatives as acyl donors for the obtaining of statin analogues.







Abstract
This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9&#8208;catalyzed acylation. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were designed as the electrocatalyst for conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural into 2, 5&#8208;furanedioic acid, achieving superior electrooxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100&#8201;% HMF conversion at 1.43&#8197;V (vs. RHE) with 98.8&#8201;% FDCA yield and 98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open&#8208;circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-CoP heterostructure nanosheets&lt;/b&gt; were designed as the electrocatalyst for conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural into 2, 5-furanedioic acid, achieving superior electrooxidation performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value-added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave-assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100&#8201;% HMF conversion at 1.43&#8197;V (vs. RHE) with 98.8&#8201;% FDCA yield and 98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open-circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based AIE Supramolecular Polymer Networks Exhibiting Various Fluorescence to Achieve Visible Surveillance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is significant to achieve visual surveillance of the formation process for supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs). A special AIEgen was introduced into SPNs constructed by host&#8211;guest recognition between pillar[5]arene and pyridine salt. With rising cross&#8208;linking degree, the fluorescence color changes from blue to green due to the gradual aggregated AIEgen, enabling the formation process becoming visually.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it is known that evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative is introduced into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8211;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.

         <title>Substituted meta[n]Cycloparaphenylenes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Host&#8211;guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different sized cyano&#8208;meta[n]cycloparaphenylenes (CN&#8208;m[n]CPPs) have been prepared for investigation of their photophysical properties. Furthermore, CN&#8208;m[6]CPP served as key substrate to demonstrate the versatility of the nitrile functionality and therefore a general concept towards functionalized m[n]CPPs was developed. Additionally, CN&#8208;m[10]CPP was used to report the first association constant of a m[10]CPP with fullerene C60.







Abstract
Breaking the centrosymmetry of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) by one meta connection, leads to bright emission in the typically non&#8208;fluorescent smaller derivatives, conserving their size dependent emissive properties. Using the building block strategy for [n]CPPs, different nitrile substituted meta[n]CPPs (n=6, 8, 10) have been prepared. The nitrile substituent offers a convenient handle for functional group conversions (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, aldehyde, as well as 1H&#8208;tetrazole). Besides the synthetic work, the photophysical properties of these novel m[n]CPP derivatives have been characterized. Additionally, the host&#8211;guest ability of cyano&#8208;m[10]CPP has been explored by studying its complexation with fullerene C60. These insights open new applications of meta[n]CPPs as fluorophore in synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences as well as biomedical research.

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; Photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by Aryldiazonium Salts and Arylazo Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>

Photografting of azosulfates Ar&#8722;N=NSO3Na on gold, leads to bonded organic films. Au&#8722;R or Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;R bonding results from a stepwise or concerted reaction respectively. Azosulfonates are shelf stable compounds which are much easier to handle with respect to the commonaryldiazonium salt.







Abstract
Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8722;N=N&#8722;SO3Na) have been found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8722;Nsp2&#8722; and Au&#8722;Csp2&#8722; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8722;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy), and the bond dissociation energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8722;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layer films has been observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>Design of Cu&#8208;Substituted O3&#8208;Type NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The effect of different copper contents on the electrochemical performance of environmentally friendly CO/Ni&#8208;free O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based cathode is systematically investigated. The introduction of a high proportion of copper can simultaneously regulate both the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and the bulk phase. Therefore, the obtained cathode material with an optimized component of NaCu0.20Fe0.30Mn0.50O2 achieves a significant improvement in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.

Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3-NaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials is systematically investigated. The as-prepared NaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.30&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase. It shows superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C, a capacity retention rate of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.30&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.50&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low-cost and high-performance O3-type layered cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for the Selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Never&#8208;Ending Story?</title>

The exohedral functionalization of carbon nanomaterials with tailored O&#8208;containing groups appears as the long&#8208;sought solution for putting an end to a highly controversial matter within the scientific community: shedding light on the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship in metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the challenging 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization of the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

Abstract
A series of thienoindolizine structural isomers have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.

Synthesis of a 3D porous organic polymer starting from a simple 0D bistriflate precursor via in&#8197;situ CsF catalyzed formation of benzyne. This is the first demonstration of 3D polymer being prepared from a single and simple precursor. The resulting benzyne&#8208;derived porous organic polymer showed 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 surface area and IAST CO2/N2 selectivity of 65.4







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very high CO2/N2 selectivities.

         <title>Pushing the Boundary of Covalency in Lanthanoid&#8208;Tellurium Bonds: Insights from the Synthesis, Molecular and Electronic Structures of Low&#8208;Coordinate, Monomeric Europium(II) and Ytterbium(II) Tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolate complexes is achieved using hybrid tellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. According to DFT calculations, while the complexes have most of their lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds located on the Te atoms, the lanthanoid metals contribute significantly to the bond, thus resulting in a notable covalency.







Abstract
Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing hybrid organotellurolate ligands containing N&#8208;donor pendant arms. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8&#8242;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metals (Ln=Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R=C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;CH2NMe2] [3: Ln=Eu, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln=Eu, Solv=acetonitrile; 5: Ln=Yb, Solv=tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln=Yb, Solv=pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv=tetrahydrofuran, n=3; 8: Solv=1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n=2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8211;4 and 7&#8211;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8211;8 are validated by single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The electronic structures of these complexes were investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed appreciable covalency between the tellurolate ligands and lanthanoids.

         <title>Fast Visualized Conformational Transition of Polyphenylacetylenes with Stepwise Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.







Abstract
Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure&#8208;based smart CPL materials.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bridged Distyrylbenzene with Highly Bright Solid&#8208;State Red&#8208;Orange Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>

A red&#8208;emitting aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) is realized by introducing a bridging structure into push&#8208;pull distyrylbenzene.







Abstract
Multiple emission colors in solid&#8208;state organic fluorophores with the same main skeleton are essential for improving the performance of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials. Specifically, emission in the red/near&#8208;infrared region is of great importance in the biological field. Previously, we developed di&#8208;bridged&#8208;distyrylbenzene DBDB[7] with high&#8208;brightness solid&#8208;state blue and aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) by introducing the bridging structures of a seven&#8208;membered ring into the vinylene groups of distyrylbenzene (DSB). Herein, we synthesize MNDBDMeODB[7] (1), which features substituted methoxy and malononitrile groups as donor and acceptor groups, respectively, in DBDB[7]. In solvents more polar than THF, MNDSDMeOB (3), which has the same main skeleton as 1 but without bridges, shows no emission in the solid state, whereas 1 exhibits highly bright red&#8208;orange emission in the solid state owing to the suppression of intermolecular electronic interactions by the bridges and the AIE property. We also synthesize MNDSD(EHO)B (2) in which the methoxy groups of 3 are replaced by ethylhexyloxy groups, thus disrupting the crystallinity of the molecule. 2 exhibits positive fluorescence solvatochromism and has a high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state as a red&#8208;emitting DSB derivative. The solid&#8208;state emission properties of 1 and 2 will improve the applicability of DSBs and functionalities of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation into and formalisation of dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology is reported. By designing substrates bearing complementary azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles, we were able to employ integrated experimental and theoretical studies to construct a series of polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and rationalise the mechanistic basis of the divergent reactivity observed.







Abstract
The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation leads to the formation of a persistent 3D 9&#8208;borafluorene radical that exhibits remarkable stability in both solid and solution states. Single crystal structure, EPR analysis, and theoretical studies indicate that the unpaired electron is predominantly located on boron.







Abstract
In this contribution, we reported the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) analogues of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium and 9&#8208;borafluorene radical. The radical was fully characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character of 9&#8208;borafluorene radical was corroborated by DFT calculations and EPR analysis.

Towards heterocyclic diversity: A highly diastereoselective organocatalyzed domino vinylogous sulfa&#8208;Michael&#8208;aldol&#8208;cyclocondensation (VMAC) reaction has been developed using alkylidene Meldrum's acid as dienes highlighting two vinylogous steps, namely an unprecedented sulfa&#8208;1,6&#8208;conjugate addition and a diastereoselective aldol reaction triggering a formal (4+2) cycloaddition, which opens a new route to bio&#8208;relevant and original tricyclic thiochroman derivatives.

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence is very rare in all&#8208;organic emitters. Here we show how this property can emerge as a function of energy gaps between the phosphorescent state and higher energy charge&#8208;transfer states. An optimal gap of &#8764;0.4&#8197;eV yields efficient phosphorescence, with smaller gaps leading to thermally activated delayed fluorescence and larger gaps allowing triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation to dominate.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8722;Th&#8722;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.

         <title>A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly convenient strategy to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using a newly discovered reagent in presence of a fluoride source. The reactions are generally complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;triflation of complex peptides bearing challenging side chains like arginine and histidine. We show that aryl triflates can be an interesting moiety for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We report the discovery of a straightforward protocol to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented O&#8208;triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late&#8208;stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in&#8197;vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of a Benzotrisazulene via Trioxobenzotrisazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotrisazulene was synthesized on the basis of a truxene precursor by a series of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions via the intermediate trisoxo compound. The latter occurs in two forms (syn and anti), and the syn forms porous crystals.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing odd&#8208;membered rings (such as pentagons or heptagons) are fascinating synthetic targets. A special case is the introduction of five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in form of an azulene unit. Azulene itself is an aromatic compounds known for its deep blue color, which is a result of its internal dipole moment. When azulene is embedded into PAHs it can change the optoelectronic properties of the PAH significantly. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a PAH containing three azulene units is reported via reduction and elimination of its trioxo derivative.

We present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.







Abstract
Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4]2 in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8722;H activation pathway in the reduction process.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical embedded in a curved cycloparaphenylene skeleton was generated and characterized to examine the reactivity and magnetic interaction of the two diradical units in the bent molecular structure. Ferromagnetic interactions within the diradical unit and antiferromagnetic interaction between the diradical units lead to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state for the tetraradical.







Abstract
Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20&#8197;K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.

         <title>Cover Feature: Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium (Chem. Eur. J. 42/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent and predominantly localized boron radical has been synthesized by the single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D analogue of an NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation. The steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(o&#8208;carborane) backbone and the almost perpendicular orientation of the NHC ligand give rise to the distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Ye and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301270).

Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternative substrates for the LovD9 acylation mechanism, showing product yields as high as those obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethylbutyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 42, July 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in the skeletal editing of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with an emphasis on the scope, reactivity, selectivity, and general mechanistic considerations. The impressive breadth of application of this strategy in both drug discovery and total synthesis is also discussed. Existing challenges and perspectives on future research directions to further understanding and new reaction developments are outlined.







Abstract
(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews on peripheral editing (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editings via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations have received less attention in the review literature. In this review, we systematically summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and their applications in natural product syntheses. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies are also highlighted.

         <title>Synchronous Proton&#8208;Hydride Transfer by a Pyrazole&#8208;Functionalized Protic Mn(I) Complex in Catalytic Alcohol Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Mn(I) complexes Mn(L1)(CO)3Br, Mn(L2)(CO)3Br, Mn(L1)(CO)3(OAc) and Mn(L3)(CO)3Br [L1 = 2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, L2 = 2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine, L3 = 2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine] were synthesized and fully characterized. The acid&#8208;base equilibrium between the pyrazole and the pyrazolato forms of Mn(L1)(CO)3Br was studied by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. These complexes are screened as catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of primary alcohols and aromatic diamines for the synthesis of benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives with the release of H2 and H2O as byproducts. The protic complex Mn(L1)(CO)3Br shows the highest catalytic activity for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole derivatives with broad substrate scope, whereas a related complex [Mn(L3)(CO)3Br], which is devoid of the proton responsive &#946;&#8208;NH unit, shows significantly reduced catalytic efficiency validating the crucial role of the &#946;&#8208;NH functionality for the alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. Control experiments, kinetic and deuterated studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synchronous hydride&#8208;proton transfer by the metal&#8208;ligand construct in the alcohol dehydrogenation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on the Photophysical and Photoredox Properties of Tetraaza[7]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted polyaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and their (photo)physical properties and capabilities as photoredox catalysts were investigated. DFT calculations on the derivatives and three more model compounds were performed to predict the photoredox properties of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of substituted derivatives of tetraaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and the influence of the substitution on their photophysical and photoredox&#8208;catalytic properties was studied. The combination of their high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.65 and their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity results in CPL brightness values (BCPL) that are among the highest recorded for [7]helicenes so far. A sulfonylation/hetarylation reaction using cyanopyridines as substrates for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited helicenes was conducted to test for viability in photoredox catalysis. DFT calculations predict the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to yield more oxidizing catalysts.

         <title>Base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene oxide, imide and sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of a base&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene (k2&#8208;NNP)P (12, NNP= phosphinoamidinate) with N2O afforded a labile phopshinidene oxide (k2&#8208;NNP)P=O (16) which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Further oxidation of 16 by N2O or reaction of 12 with two equivalents of pyridine oxide afforded the isolable dioxide (k2&#8208;NNP)PO2 which was characterized by NMR and SC XRD. Trapping of 16 with tolyl Isocyanate resulted in P=O/N=C metathesis, eventually affording a urea&#8208;ligated phosphine (k1&#8208;NNP)P(NTol)2C=O (17) The mechanism of this reaction was elucidated by DFT calculations. Reactions of phosphinidene 12 with azides generated transient imines (NNP)P=NR, which in the case of R=Tol underwent cycloaddition with tolyl Isocyanate to afford the urea product 17, and in the case of R=SiMe3 reacts with N3SiMe3 via the addition of N&#8208;Si across the P=N bond affording, after the extrusion of dinitrogen, a P,N&#8208;heterocyclic compound. Both products of the reactions with azides have been fully characterized, both in solution and the solid&#8208;state. Finally, reaction of phosphinidene 12 with one equivalent of sulfur resulted in the isolation of the base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene sulfide (k2&#8208;NNP)P=S that has also been fully characterized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We prepared and characterized (UV&#8208;vis, epr, X&#8208;ray) four substituted nonacenes. They are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8208;9&#160;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#181;e=0.007 cm2/Vs; &#181;h=0.023 cm2/Vs).</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;driven, non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion of silicon heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silacycles are ubiquitous building blocks. Small silacycles can typically be expanded catalytically. We have prepared a silirane (1), silirene (2) and phosphasilirene (3) as well as a siletane (4) and a silolene (5) starting from the base&#8208;free bromosilylene [(dtbpCbz)SiBr]. As these heterocycles were derived from a dicoordinated silylene, they are susceptible to reactions with an external base. The three&#8208;membered silacycles readily undergo non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion reactions with isonitriles yielding the related four&#8208;membered silacycles. Surprisingly, the ring&#8208;expanded derivatives of the silirane 1 undergo up to two further isomerisation reactions, first by enamine formation and then by another ring expansion. DFT computations were utilised to gauge the scope of this reactivity pattern. Three&#8208;membered silacycles should essentially universally undergo a ring expansion with isonitriles, while for four&#8208;membered silacycles, only very few instances are predicted to accommodate more challenging kinetic requirements of this ring expansion. Larger silacycles lack the ring strain energy required for this ring expansion reaction and are not expected to be expanded.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New cationic aluminium complexes with terminal alkoxy substituents (&#8722;OMe and &#8722;OtBu) are reported; these showed markedly higher Lewis acidity than the known hydride and methyl analogues, as evident from their Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test, NBO analysis and hydride ion affinity calculations. These complexes activate triethylsilane and are good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and alkene.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported aluminium complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L=[HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further used as synthons to generate the fascinating cationic aluminium alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#956;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron&#8208;demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminium halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of an iridium tetrahydride (LIrH4, L=DippNacnac) with main&#8208;group (E=Sn, Pb, Bi) amides/alkoxides results in the extrusion of amines/alcohols with formation of iridium dimetallotetrylenes (LIrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets; in contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.







Abstract
Reactions of the IrV hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI=(Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E=Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in&#8197;situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 through the apparent cleavage of an E&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8722;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared by the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(OtBu)3 to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.

Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-E)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was prepared by the reaction of [&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;]IrH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with Bi(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Bi(O&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two-coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open-shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is characterized as having a closed-shell singlet ground state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Substituted Phosphasilenes and its Rare Homologue Stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidinate stabilized low valent phosphasilenes &gt;Si=P&#8722; and a heavier homologue stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; are reported. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 are heavy analogues of imine or Schiff base. In both phosphorus compounds, Si exhibits double bond character. All compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and 1 and 2 also by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein we report the reduction of R&#8208;EX2 (E=P, Sb) with two equivalents of KC8 in the presence of silylene (LSiR; L=PhC(NtBu)2) to give Trip&#8208;P=SiL(C6H4PPh2) (1), TerPh&#8722;P=(tBu)SiL (2) and TerPh&#8722;Sb=(tBu)SiL (3). The last (3) belongs to a new class of heavier analogues of Schiff bases (&gt;C=N&#8722;), containing a formal &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; double bond. The theoretical calculations suggest that lone pairs on the dicoordinated group&#8208;15 centers are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions resulting in pseudo&#8208;Si&#8722;P/Si&#8722;Sb multiple bonds which are highly reactive as indicated by the high first and second proton affinities.

         <title>Autofluorescent Artemisinin&#8208;Benzimidazole Hybrids via Organo&#8208;Click Reaction: Study of Antiviral Properties and Mode of Action in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general concept for the easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs by combining two readily available non&#8208;fluorescent pharmacophores via a non&#8208;cleavable linker using an organo&#8208;click reaction is presented. In vitro investigation of new antiviral hybrid compounds revealed that they change mitochondrial structures. The developed approach offers facilitated insight into drug modes of action in living cells, avoiding the need for its linkage to external fluorescent markers.







Abstract
Drug modification by a fluorescent label is a common tool for studying its mechanism of action with fluorescence microscopy techniques. However, the attachment of a fluorescent label can significantly alter the polarity, solubility, and biological activity of the investigated drug, and, as a result, the studied mechanism of action can be misrepresented. Therefore, developing efficient drugs, which are inherently fluorescent and can be tracked directly in the cell is highly favorable. Here an easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs is presented, generated by a combination of two readily available non&#8208;fluorescent pharmacophores via a non&#8208;cleavable linker using a Ramachary&#8208;Bressy&#8208;Wang organocatalyzed azide&#8208;carbonyl [3+2] cycloaddition (organo&#8208;click) reaction. All newly prepared fluorescent compounds showed strong anti&#8208;HCMV activity (EC50 down to 0.07&#177;0.00&#8197;&#956;M), thus presenting a very promising drug developmental basis compared to the approved drug ganciclovir (EC50 2.60&#177;0.50&#8197;&#956;M). Remarkably, in&#8197;vitro fluorescent imaging investigation of new compounds revealed induced changes in mitochondrial structures, which is a phenotypical hallmark of antiviral activity. This approach opens up new vistas for the easy formation of potent fluorescent drugs from readily available non&#8208;fluorescent parent compounds and might facilitate insight into their mode of action in living cells, avoiding the requirement of linkage to external fluorescent markers.

         <title>Unexpected Coexisting Solid Solutions in the Quasi&#8208;Binary Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 Phase Diagram
</title>

Despite large difference of ionic radii of Cu(II) and Ag(II) cations, difluorides of these metals readily form two structurally related solid solutions, which recite the structural polytypes of parent compounds.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction between orthorhombic AgF2 and monoclinic CuF2 (y=0.15, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) in a fluorine atmosphere resulted in coexisting solid solutions of Cu&#8208;poor orthorhombic and Cu&#8208;rich monoclinic phases with stoichiometry Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2. Based on X&#8208;ray powder diffraction analyses, the mutual solubility in the orthorhombic phase (AgF2&#8201;:&#8201;Cu) appears to be at an upper limit of Cu concentration of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% (Ag0.7Cu0.3F2), while the monoclinic phase (CuF2&#8201;:&#8201;Ag) can form a nearly stoichiometric Cu&#8201;:&#8201;Ag=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solid solution (Cu0.56Ag0.44F2), preserving the CuF2 crystal structure. Experimental data and DFT calculations showed that AgF2&#8201;:&#8201;Cu and CuF2&#8201;:&#8201;Ag solid solutions deviate from the classical Vegard's law. Magnetic measurements of Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2 showed that the N&#233;el temperature (TN) decreases with increasing Cu content in both phases. Likewise, theoretical DFT+U calculations for Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2 showed that the progressive substitution of Ag by Cu decreases the magnetic interaction strength |J2D| in both structures. Electrical conductivity measurements of Ag0.85Cu0.15F2 showed a modest increase in specific ionic conductivity (3.71&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;13&#177;2.6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;15&#8197;S/cm) as compared to pure AgF2 (1.85&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;13&#177;1.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;15&#8197;S/cm), indicating the formation of a vacancy&#8208; or F adatom&#8208;free metal difluoride sample.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Enantioenriched Tertiary and Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Chiral Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to enantioenriched tertiary and quaternary &#945;&#8208;chiral allysilanes without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst is reported. This was achieved by enantioselective allylic displacement of &#947;&#8208;silylated allylic bromides through Lewis base activation of Grignard reagents by a bidentate chiral NHC ligand.

This was achieved by enantioselective allylic displacement of &#947;-silylated allylic bromides through Lewis base activation of Grignard reagents by a bidentate chiral NHC ligand. The process afforded both high &#947;-regio- and enantioselectivity and is compatible with a wide range of silyl groups on the substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Modification of ITO with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors Results in Electron Selective Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface modification of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes with organic molecules is known to tune their work function which results in higher charge carrier selectivity in corresponding organic electronic devices and hence influences the performance of organic solar cells. In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have also been proven to be capable to modify the work function of metals and semimetals compared to the unfunctionalized surface via the formation of strong covalent bonds. In this report, we have designed and performed the modification of the ITO surface with NHC by using the zwitterionic bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 as the NHC precursor, applied via spin coating. Upon modification, the work function of ITO electrodes was reduced significantly which resulted in electron selective contacts in corresponding organic photovoltaic devices. In addition, various characterization techniques and analytical methods are used to elucidate the nature of the bound species and the corresponding binding mechanism of the material to the ITO surface.</dc:description>

Organo photocatalyst: Visible light enabled metal&#8208;free redox&#8208;neutral direct C3&#8722;H alkylation/arylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with Inert alkyl and aryl chlorides have been reported.







Abstract
In the present manuscript, we reported the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;enabled direct C3&#8722;H alkylation/arylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with unactivated alkyl/aryl chlorides under metal&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of unactivated alkyl and aryl chlorides containing different functionalities are coupled with a variety of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives under mild reaction conditions to afford the C3&#8208;alkyl/aryl substituted quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Surface Engineering in Covalent Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>

Surface engineering of covalent organic polymers has been performed to investigate the relationship between structure and property by experiments and DFT calculations, which provides a feasible guidance for the design of effective porous cathode materials.







Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology due to their tempting high theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, the wastage of active materials that originates from the shuttling effect of polysulfides still hinders advancement of Li&#8722;S batteries. The effective design of cathode materials is extremely pivotal to solve this thorny problem. Herein, surface engineering in covalent organic polymers (COPs) has been performed to investigate the influence of pore wall polarity on the performance of COP&#8208;based cathodes used for Li&#8722;S batteries. With the assistance of experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, performance improvement by increasing pore surface polarity and a synergy effect of the polarized functionalities, along with nano&#8208;confinement effect of the COPs, are disclosed, to which the improved performance of Li&#8722;S batteries including outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.0&#8201;%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.08&#8201;% over 425 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C) is attributed. This work not only enlightens the designable synthesis and applications of covalent polymers as polar sulfur hosts with high utilization of active materials, but also provides a feasible guide for the design of effective cathode materials for future advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

Abstract
The curved &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface of bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene has been multiply methylated to form exo&#8208;di&#8208;, &#8208;tetra&#8208;, and &#8208;hexamethylated corannulenes. The multimethylations became possible through in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species, and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR, MS, UV&#8208;Vis measurements, and DFT calculations have revealed the molecular structures of the multimethylated corannulenes and the sequence of the multimethylation. This work has the potential to contribute to the controlled synthesis and characterizations of multifunctionalized fullerenes.

Its molecular structure and UV&#8208;induced photochemistry were investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies together with quantum chemical calculations, undertaken at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory.







Abstract
The molecular structure and photochemistry of dispiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8242;&#8208;[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane&#8208;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]&#8208;4&#8208;one (TX), an antiparasitic 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraoxane was investigated using matrix isolation IR and EPR spectroscopies, together with quantum chemical calculations undertaken at the DFT(B3LYP)/6&#8208;311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory, with and without Grimme's dispersion correction. Photolysis of the matrix&#8208;isolated TX, induced by in&#8197;situ broadband (&#955;&gt;235&#8197;nm) or narrowband (&#955; in the range 220&#8211;263&#8197;nm) irradiation, led to new bands in the infrared spectrum that could be ascribed to two distinct photoproducts, oxepane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, and 4&#8208;oxohomoadamantan&#8208;5&#8208;one. Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O&#8722;O bond, with the formation of an oxygen&#8208;centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon&#8208;centered)/(oxygen&#8208;centered) diradical, yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of the compound at &#955;=266&#8197;nm, in acetonitrile ice (T=10&#8211;80&#8197;K). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that the TX molecule adopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and matrix&#8208;isolation conditions, revealing that the intermolecular interactions in the TX crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectrum of the crystalline material and that of matrix&#8208;isolated TX. The detailed structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here appear relevant to the practical uses of TX in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.

Photolysis of the matrix-isolated TX, induced by in&#8197;situ broadband (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;235&#8197;nm) or narrowband (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; in the range 220&#8211;263&#8197;nm) irradiation, led to new bands in the infrared spectrum that could be ascribed to two distinct photoproducts, oxepane-2,5-dione, and 4-oxohomoadamantan-5-one. Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O&#8722;O bond, with the formation of an oxygen-centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon-centered)/(oxygen-centered) diradical, yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of the compound at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=266&#8197;nm, in acetonitrile ice (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;=10&#8211;80&#8197;K). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that the &lt;b&gt;TX&lt;/b&gt; molecule adopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and matrix-isolation conditions, revealing that the intermolecular interactions in the &lt;b&gt;TX&lt;/b&gt; crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectrum of the crystalline material and that of matrix-isolated &lt;b&gt;TX&lt;/b&gt;. The detailed structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here appear relevant to the practical uses of &lt;b&gt;TX&lt;/b&gt; in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Ion Pairing of &#954;6N Complexes with Rare&#8208;Earth Elements in the Solid State and in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rare earth element complexes (Ln=Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating tripodal ligands have been synthetized and characterized. After estimation of their donor capabilities, the ligands selectivity through the lanthanide cations have been investigated.







Abstract
The rare earth element complexes (Ln=Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several podant &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating ligands have been synthetized and thoroughly characterized. The structural properties of the complexes have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction in the solid state and by advanced NMR methods in solution. To estimate the donor capabilities of the presented ligands, an experimental comparison study has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry as well as absorption experiments using the cerium complexes and by analyzing 89Y&#8197;NMR chemical shifts of the different yttrium complexes. In order to obtain a complete and detailed picture, all experiments were corroborated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations. Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Naphthols using Primary Alcohols: Elucidating the Influence of Base and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized arenes and arenols have diverse applications in chemical synthesis and material chemistry. Selective functionalization of arenols is a topic of prime interest. In particular, direct alkylation of arenols using alcohols is a challenging task. In this report, a ruthenium pincer catalyzed direct a&#8208;alkylation of b&#8208;naphthol using primary alcohols as alkylating reagents is reported. Notably, aryl and heteroaryl methanols and linear and branched aliphatic alcohols underwent selective alkylation reactions, in which water is the only byproduct. Notably, catalytically derived a&#8208;alkyl&#8208;b&#8208;naphthol products displayed high absorbance, emissive properties, and quantum yields (up to 93.2%). Dearomative bromination on a&#8208;alkyl&#8208;b&#8208;naphthol is demonstrated as a synthetic application.&#160; Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves an aldehyde intermediate. DFT studies support this finding and further reveal that a stoichiometric amount of base is required to make the aldol condensation as well as elementary steps required for regeneration of catalytically active species. In situ&#8208;generated water molecule from the aldol condensation reaction plays an important role in the regeneration of an active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and Reusable Fe3O4/ZIF&#8208;8 Composite for Encapsulation of FDH Enzyme under Mild Conditions Applicable to CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ encapsulation of the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme during the aqueous synthesis of ZIF&#8208;8 in the presence of magnetite yields a bio&#8208;composed system with long&#8208;time hydrostability and excellent reusability. The immobilization strategy enhances the catalytic activity in formic acid production from 300 (free FDH) to 1015&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in&#8208;situ encapsulation under mild conditions using formate dehydrogenase in a ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme's operation medium can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst, and the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as concentrators of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86&#8201;% of its activity after a long time of five cycles, thus indicating an excellent magnetic recovery and a good reusability.

         <title>Temporal Control of Fluorescent EuW10 Aggregates For Autonomous DNA Capture and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly exploits noncovalent interaction to offer a facile and effective method for the fabrication of materials. For Na9[EuW10O36]&#183;32H2O (EuW10), the negative charges and abundant oxygen atoms on its surface provide a handle for static self&#8208;assembly. New properties are envisioned for EuW10 aggregates which are able to display such kinetics and time&#8208;programming characteristics, in order to satisfy more complex and intelligent application scenarios, such as DNA binding and information encryption. In this work, EuW10 coupling with stimuli&#8208;responsive dodecyl dimethylamine oxide (C12DMAO) can generate versatile aggregates with pH&#8208;responsive properties. We demonstrated the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH clock reaction endows EuW10 assemblies with dynamical properties, in which the charges and fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent assemblies provide new application in time&#8208;programmed DNA capture and information encryption.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We herein reported the design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand that is featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Hydride donor LAH converted non&#8208;reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the gap between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs: Formation of all&#8208;silica zeolite with high framework density from natural layered silicate magadiite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A silica zeolite (RWZ&#8208;1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two&#8208;step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel&#8208;like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000 &#197;3. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;&#8208;quartz (26.5)). RWZ&#8208;1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high&#8208;density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer&#8208;like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Amination of Alcohols Using Diazo Compounds under Manganese Catalysis Through Hydrogenative N&#8208;Alkylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable chemical production requires fundamentally new types of catalysts and catalytic technologies. The development of coherent and robust catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals is essential, but highly challenging. Herein, we systematically explored a general hydrogenative cleavage/N&#8208;alkylation tandem of cyclic and acyclic diazo (N=N) compounds to value&#8208;added amines under manganese catalysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a single&#8208;site molecular manganese complex and proceeds via tandem dehydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, and borrowing hydrogenation strategies. Interestingly, the reaction involves abundantly available renewable feedstocks, such as alcohols, that can act as (transfer)hydrogenating and alkylating agents. The synthetic application of our approach in large&#8208;scale pharmaceutical synthesis and easy access to highly demanding N&#8208;CH3/CD3 derivatives are also demonstrated. Kinetic studies show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of alcohol and Mn&#8208;catalyst and follows fractional orders. Several selective bond activation/formation reactions occur sequentially via amine&#8211;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;driven Pore Functionalization of Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) imparts additional functionality to metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that is often difficult to access using solvothermal synthesis. As such, expanding the repertory of PSM reactions available to the practitioner is of increased importance for the generation of materials tailored for desired applications. Herein, we describe a method for the protecting group&#8208;free installation of diverse functional groups within the pores of a MIL&#8208;53(Al) analogue via disulfide bond formation. The majority of the reactions proceed with thiol&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversions ranging from high to nearly quantitative. The disulfide bonds are stable in various solvents and can be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic compounds having two and three rubicene substructures were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of oligoarene precursors. These nanographene&#8208;like compounds have planar aromatic frameworks, and its length along the long axis reaches 2.8&#8197;nm for the trimer. These compounds showed characteristic absorption and fluorescence bands in the long&#8208;wavelength region owing to small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps by effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reaction of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic framework of these compounds. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands were considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Basic Nitrogen Unmasking in Arene Ruthenium Complexes Derived from Z&#8208;Configured 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Azobispyridine</title>

Traceless release: A series of E and Z isomeric forms of arene RuII complexes bearing ligands derived from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine is disclosed. The stability of the uncommon Z&#8208;configured complexes exhibiting 7&#8208;membered chelate ring involving two pyridines allows single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. Upon action of light, irreversible Z&#8594;E isomerization with rearrangement of the coordination pattern occurs, thereby unmasking a basic nitrogen atom.







Abstract
Two novel 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine derivatives bearing N&#8208;dialkylamino substituents at position 4,4&#8242; were synthesized and their E&#8211;Z photoswitching behavior was characterized by combination of 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Vis absorption and DFT calculations. Both isomers act as ligands towards arene&#8208;RuII centers, leading either to E&#8208;configured 5&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from N=N bond and pyridine) or to the uncommon Z&#8208;configured 7&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from both pyridines). The latter show good stability in the dark, allowing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. All synthesized Z&#8208;configured arene&#8208;RuII complexes undergo irreversible photo&#8208;isomerization to their corresponding E isomers with rearrangement of their coordination pattern. This property was advantageously exploited for the light&#8208;promoted unmasking of a basic nitrogen atom of the ligand.

         <title>Easily Accessible Substituted Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos as Bistable Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic hemithioindigo chromophores are easily accessible from the condensation of aldehydes and thioindoxyl derivatives. Using electron&#8208;rich heterocycles leads to excellent photoswitching properties such as strong absorption in visible light, good absorption changes between two isomers, quantitative isomer interconversions in both directions and high thermal stability.







Abstract
Thioaurone chromophores, part of the indigoid family and commonly named hemithioindigos, have recently gained attention due to their interesting photoswitching properties. The study focuses on heterocyclic hemithioindigos (Het&#8208;HTIs) and investigates their synthesis using electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles and modifications to the thioindigo moiety. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the photoswitching performances of these synthesised compounds, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the heterocycles on the photoisomerization capabilities, which was found to be more prominent than the modifications made to the thioindigo moiety. Among the 44 Het&#8208;HTIs tested, several exhibited highly efficient photoswitchable properties, demonstrating Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization in the blue region, and E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization in the green or the red regions. Additionally, the metastable E&#8208;isomer displayed an impressive half&#8208;life of up to 54&#8197;days in a polar solvent (DMSO). These results suggest that heterocyclic hemithioindigos hold great promise as photoswitches for researchers interested in light&#8208;controlled molecular mechanisms.

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties of Aza&#8208;BODIPYs in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region by Introducing Electron&#8208;Donating Thiophene Substituents</title>

New poly&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;bodipy NIR dyes: a combined photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical study.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituted by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;Electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;Shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricolor electrochromic systems were constructed by realizing a double dynamic structural change that facilitates an apparent 2e&#8208;transfer in both oxidation and reduction processes. Therefore, redox interconversion cleanly proceeds among neutral (zigzag), dicationic (L&#8208;shape), and tetracationic (planar) states, accompanied by a drastic change in color and near infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorption.







Abstract
Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)&#8208;substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent two&#8208;electron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For these tetracations, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coordination to a pyridine&#8208;based arylene ethynylene provides an expedient pathway to encapsulated molecular rotors or turnstiles. With the modularity of the synthetic design, this strategy provides access to a wide variety of encapsulated turnstile&#8208;type structures. X&#8208;ray crystallography, solution 1H&#8197;NMR, and solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR provide insight into the potential for rotation of the central unit.







Abstract
Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotators encapsulated within macrocyclic stators. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotators, X&#8208;ray crystallography of AgI&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for unobstructed rotation or wobbling of rotators within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR of PdII&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon the introduction of PdII to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.

&#8220;Sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper (I) complex catalyzes reactions of CF3CHN2 and CF3CF2CHN2 reagents with C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a large panel of alkyl esters, halides, and protected amines resulting in introduction of trifluoroethyl&#8208; and pentafluoropropyl groups with predictable regioselectivities.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative&#8208;Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative&#8208;Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of Si&#8722;O&#8722;C bond has been the monopoly of precious, rare, late transition metal catalysts. Reported here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, dehydrogenative polymerization and tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation with only H2 as the byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates an array of alcohols, silanes and produces Si&#8722;O coupled product under mild conditions with excellent yield.







Abstract
Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8722;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8722;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.

         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent main group compounds that fluoresce in the solid&#8208;state were previously unknown. To address this, we investigated room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence from a series of crystals of germylenes 3&#8208;8 in this article; they exhibited emissions nearly reaching the NIR. Germylene carboxylates (3&#8208;8) were synthesized by reacting dipyrromethene&#8208;stabilized germylene pyrrolide (2) with carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, p&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, and acetylsalicylic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of hierarchical CdS/NiS photocatalysts using Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 as template for efficient ethanol conversion and hydrogen production under visible light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of ethanol into high&#8208;valuable chemicals and H2 by photocatalytic process provides a sustainable approach to produce carbon&#8208;chain&#8208;prolonged chemicals and hydrogen energy. In this article, Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8208;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst was subjected to photocatalytic ethanol conversion, and the hierarchical composite material CdS/NiS&#8208;N (100) formed by adding 100mg of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and stability in an ethanol aqueous solution with a water content of 10%. Under visible light irradiation, the conversion rate of ethanol reached 15.2% at the photocatalytic reaction of 5h. The selectivity of 2,3&#8208;butanediol(2,3&#8208;BDO) was 25%, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde(AA) was 63%. Through various characterizations, it has been proven that a large specific surface area and the coupling interface between CdS and NiS are key factors in improving photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing photocatalysts with coupled cocatalysts/semiconductors and large specific surface areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as light&#8208;controllable chelation&#8208;type ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized toward controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the homogeneous aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane formed aggregation structures under the appropriate conditions, as was clearly observed for the first time. Detailed study of this phenomenon revealed that [3]rotaxane aggregated with hexagonal packing owing to hydrogen bond formation among CD units, in a manner similar to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type upon dispersion, through the axle end structures, and by modification of CD. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Akae and P. Theato (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301582).

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclotrimerization (Rh, Co, and Ni catalysts) of triyne 1 gives rise preferentially to [9]helical indenofluorene, whereas it thermal cyclization gives rise to polyaromatic hydrocarbon 3. The former reaction proceeds via classical alkyne cyclotrimerization, the latter via dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction accompanied by unusual C&#8722;C cleavage. DFT calculations shed light on the course of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition&#8211;metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on the reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a ballet studio, azaheptalene with M helicity is dancing in front of a mirror. The molecule reflected in the mirror shows a novel azaheptalene with opposite P helicity, and the large torsion angle is described by the dynamic jumping molecule. Its attractive and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are expressed rhythmically. This cover implies that the azaheptalene is now ready to come under the big spotlight. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301759).

         <title>A Versatile Route to Acyl (MIDA)Boronates.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach to highly functional acyl (MIDA)boronates is described. It involves the generation of the hitherto unknown radical derived from acetyl (MIDA)boronate and its capture by various alkenes, including electronically unbiased, unactivated alkenes. In contrast to the anion of acetyl (MIDA)boronate, which has not so far been employed in synthesis, the corresponding radical is well behaved and readily produced from the novel &#945;&#8208;xanthyl acetyl (MIDA)boronate. This shelf&#8208;stable, easily prepared solid is a convenient acyl (MIDA)boronate transfer agent that provides a direct entry to numerous otherwise inaccessible structures, including latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives that can be transformed into B(MIDA) substituted pyrroles and furans. A competition experiment indicated the acyl (MIDA)boronate substituted radical to be more stable than the all&#8208;carbon acetonyl radical but somewhat less reactive in additions to alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocyclic aluminium hydrides [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are readily accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4. Hydroalumination of CO2 (and other organic substrates) with [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown to access [(ADCPh)Al(OCH(O))2]2 (and other products).







Abstract
Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R=alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>The Unified Redox Scale for All Solvents: Consistency and Gibbs Transfer Energies of Electrolytes from their Constituent Single Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consistent: The unified redox scale 
 is valid for all solvents. Still, the existence of their widely used constituents, the single ion properties &#8211; redox potential or pH value &#8211; are disputed. Yet, the sum of the single ion Gibbs transfer energy of electroactive cation and anion must equal the Gibbs transfer energy of the constituting salt, which is measurable without any assumption. With the recently proposed &#8216;ideal&#8217; ILSB&#8208;method to determine Gibbs transfer energies of single ions, we now show that this condition is fulfilled. Hence, our simple electrochemical method yields consistent single&#8208;ion magnitudes proving the validity of the assembled unified redox scale.







Abstract
We have devised the unified redox scale EabsH2O, which is valid for all solvents. The necessary single ion Gibbs transfer energy between two different solvents, which only can be determined with extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions so far, must clearly satisfy two essential conditions: First, the sum of the independent cation and anion values must give the Gibbs transfer energy of the salt they form. The latter is an observable and measurable without extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions. Second, the values must be consistent for different solvent combinations. With this work, potentiometric measurements on silver ions and on chloride ions show that both conditions are fulfilled using a salt bridge filled with the ionic liquid [N2225][NTf2]: if compared to the values resulting from known pKL values, the silver and chloride single ion magnitudes combine within a uncertainty of 1.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to the directly measurable transfer magnitudes of the salt AgCl from water to the solvents acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, dimethylformamide, ethanol, and methanol. The resulting values are used to further develop the consistent unified redox potential scale EabsH2O that now allows to assess and compare redox potentials in and over six different solvents. We elaborate on its implications.

         <title>Free Ethynylarsinidene and Ethynylstibinidene: Heavier Analogues of Nitrenes and Phosphinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet ethynylarsinidene (HCCAs) and ethynylstibinidene (HCCSb) were generated photochemically in argon matrices from their corresponding pnictines. Electronic structures of these species are compared with HCCN and HCCP in light of their vibrational and electronic spectra and with support from theory.







Abstract
Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH. Here, we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of Palladium&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework and Its Application as Heterogeneous Catalysis for C&#8722;H Arylation of Azoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework with high thermal and chemical stabilities has been prepared and used as heterogeneous ligand to immobilize PdII. The resulting Pd&#8208;bound COF was found to be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the C&#8722;H arylation of azoles and aryl halides with high recyclability.







Abstract
A novel triazine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TFPT&#8208;Bz COF) has been constructed by the condensation of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) and benzidine (BZ) with deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the reaction medium. After the introduction of Pd ions through strong coordination to TFPT&#8208;Bz COF matrix, the constructed TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity for C&#8722;H arylation of azoles with aryl halides in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran. The protocol allows the arylation of a variety of substituted azoles with diverse aryl halides in high to excellent yield. Moreover, the TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd catalyst can be recycled several times without significantly reducing its activity.

&lt;p&gt;A novel triazine-based covalent organic framework (TFPT-Bz COF) has been constructed by the condensation of 2,4,6-tris(5-formyl-2-pyridinoxy)-1,3,5-triazine (TFPT) and benzidine (BZ) with deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the reaction medium. After the introduction of Pd ions through strong coordination to TFPT-Bz COF matrix, the constructed TFPT-Bz COF/Pd composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity for C&#8722;H arylation of azoles with aryl halides in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The protocol allows the arylation of a variety of substituted azoles with diverse aryl halides in high to excellent yield.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dyotropic Rearrangement of Diarylethenes: Scope, Mechanism, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. &#160;With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#160;hydrocarboxylation of nonactivated internal alkynes with conformationally flexible linker chains was achieved with cooperative gold&#8208;zinc catalysts composed of an&#160;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinylidene ligand including a bipyridine coordination site at the C5 position. A proximity effect of the gold and zinc sites was essential for their high catalytic activity, in which the internal alkyne activated by the cationic gold species was attacked by the carboxylic acid deprotonated by the basic zinc site. Using a gold(I)&#8208;complex with a bulky aromatic&#160;N&#8208;substituent,&#160;2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl group, for the NHC ligand facilitated seven&#8208;membered ring formation while minimizing intermolecular hydrocarboxylation as an undesired side reaction.

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6% at 630 nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non-radiative decay, trigger the fast spin-flipping, and enhance the light out-coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph-TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited-state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc-TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph-TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92% and a state-of-the-art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6% at 630 nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure-property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of Amyloid &#946; Aggregation and Cytotoxicity by Berbamine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking results further revealed that BBMH could bind to A&#946; fibrils, thereby hindering the aggregation process. This physical picture has been confirmed in a quantitative way by chemical kinetics analysis, which showed BBMH tends to bind with the fibril ends and thus prevents the transition from protofibrils to mature fibrils as well as the elongation process. Additionally, our MTT results showed that BBMH was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 on N2a cells. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of BBMH to inhibit A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity, offering a promising direction for further research and drug development efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Symmetric and unsymmetric diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be readily accessed in consecutive syntheses in good to excellent yields by exploiting the inherent nucleophilic character of the methine position.

Additionally, the stability of the luminescent aggregates is highly increased. In a follow&#8208;up one&#8208;pot procedure, pyrazolo&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be accessed employing a nucleophilic cyclocondensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulation of their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade reaction followed by a Scholl reaction. These naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to an increase in the fluorescence lifetime by ~20%, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than 2&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#934;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;=0.13) with the concomitant ~30% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behaviour suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno&#8208;system affects mainly the radiative rate constant in the Q&#8208;state deactivation pathway, while the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene&#8208; vs naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene&#8208;fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, NICS analysis revealed considerable difference between the aromaticity of these two isomericsystems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative Allylations: Development and Mechanistic Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)&#8208;species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.</dc:description>
