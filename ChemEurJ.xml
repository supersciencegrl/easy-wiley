         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting hydrogen production of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst with clean interface via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free COFs: Catalytic skeletons, linkages and edges have been employed to construct metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks for the oxygen reduction reaction. By tuning the COFs&#8217; electronic states, the corresponding catalytic properties can be precisely modulated, which provides new insight into designing such electrocatalysts at the molecular&#8208;level.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts that promote ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us in realizing the catalysts&#8217; design, the optimization of catalyst performance and the elucidation of structure&#8211;property relationship at the molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, as well as well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this Concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for the ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospectives for designing and constructing powerful electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.

         <title>Gd3TeBO9: A Rare&#8208;Earth Borate with Significant Magnetocaloric Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gadolinium&#8208;based oxide Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd content and excellent magnetocaloric effect is described.







Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024&#8197;ions/kg, which is 33&#8201;% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44&#8197;J/(kg&#8201;K) and 408&#8197;mJ/(cm3&#8201;K) at 2.6&#8197;K and 7&#8197;T), which is 1.5&#8197;times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phasing out of landfilling is inevitable, chemical recycling allows the consideration of plastic waste as a resource to get the most out of it to produce new valuable materials.







Abstract
Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop. Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) were investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, which allowed MDA content to be diminished below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were, therefore, synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.

Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2-EHGE-deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;Tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic engineering by targeted CRISPR editing was used to establish a sustainable production process for bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 analogues displaying FKBP12 binding while calcineurin inhibition was spared for a potential use in acute kidney injury (AKI).







Abstract
For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required, while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module&#8197;7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes Containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC=Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation and crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical and theoretical investigations of key intermediates relevant to reductive (electro)catalysis with Rh&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;MIC complexes are presented. Additionally, the interconversion between them and their role in pre&#8208;catalytic activation are discussed.







Abstract
In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.

A water&#8208;soluble iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide enabled the synthesis of complexes with hard transition metal ions, revealing a new structural motif in which six molecules assemble a macrocycle through C&#8208;Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds.







Abstract
Studies of the supramolecular chemistry of iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides have been confined to non&#8208;polar media until now. To overcome that limitation, an iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide was derivatized with a primary alcohol group; the compound is soluble in polar solvents and stable in acidic to neutral aqueous media. Nickel (II) and iron (II) form macrocyclic complexes with six molecules of that iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide in a hitherto not&#8208;observed macrocyclic arrangement defined by CTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds and &#954;6&#8208;O bound to the metal ion. This behaviour is in sharp contrast with the &#954;n&#8208;Te (n=1,2,4) complexes formed by soft metal ions.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the synthesis of glycosyl luciferins and their potential for determining glycosidase activity. Two novel synthetic routes were developed that were used to introduce the luciferin moiety in a late&#8208;stage of the sequence and the linear range of the glycosidase assays and kinetics of the substrates were determined.







Abstract
Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon the in&#8197;situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75&#8201;%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sparteine free Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement was applied to various chiral acetonides. Utilizing different vinyl boronic esters a high level of substrate control was observed leading to excellent selectivities. These selectivities were attributed to stereoelectronic effects of the neighboring acetonide moiety. The obtained formal Felkin and anti&#8208;Felkin products feature up to four contiguous stereocenters representing structural motifs common in natural products.







Abstract
Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.

&lt;p&gt;Sparteine free Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement was applied to various chiral acetonides. Utilizing different vinyl boronic esters a high level of substrate control was observed leading to excellent selectivities. These selectivities were attributed to stereoelectronic effects of the neighboring acetonide moiety. The obtained formal Felkin and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Felkin products feature up to four contiguous stereocenters representing structural motifs common in natural products.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Triggered Imine Coupling: Synthesis and Characterization of Three Redox States (0,&#8211;1,&#8211;2) of a Ni(N2S2) Complex</title>

Cyclic voltammetry of a bis(imine&#8208;thiolate) Ni(SNS)2 complex reveals that one&#8208;electron reduction triggers ligand imine C&#8722;C bond formation, quantitatively yielding a [Ni(N2S2)]&#8901;&#8722; radical monoanion that can be reversibly oxidized or further reduced to the dianion. Detailed characterization of these three redox states elucidates the redox&#8208;active role of the N2S2 ligand.







Abstract
Metal imine&#8208;thiolate complexes, M(NS)2 are known to undergo imine C&#8722;C bond formation to give M(N2S2) complexes (M=Co, Ni) containing a redox&#8208;active ligand. Although these transfor&#8208;mations are not typically quantitative, we demonstrate here that the one&#8208;electron reduction of a related Ni bis(imine&#8208;thiolate) complex affords the corresponding paramagnetic [Ni(N2S2)]&#8208; anion (2&#8901;&#8722;) exclusively; subsequent oxidation with [Cp2Fe]BF4 then affords a high yield of neutral 2 (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl). Moreover, electrochemical studies indicate that a second one&#8208;electron reduction affords the diamagnetic dianion. Both anionic products were isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD and their electronic structures were investigated by UV&#8208;vis spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and NMR spectroscopy, and DFT studies. These studies show that reduction proceeds primarily on the ligand, with (N2S2)4&#8722; containing both thiolate and ring&#8208;delocalized anions.

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of Zn(II) Self&#8208;Assemblies with Selective Cytotoxic Activity Against Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Ovo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;bidentate ligands L1 and L2 form dinuclear double helicates with Zn2+ and Cu2+ and these self&#8208;assemblies can bind phosphate and 4&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate anions. The complexes show selective cytotoxic and antitumor activity, but this is highly dependent upon which ligand, metal ion and anion are used. The lead compound [(L2)2Zn2]2+ displays in ovo efficacy with a 67&#8201;% reduction in tumor weight and 100&#8201;% embryo survival rate.







Abstract
Dipodal pyridylthiazole amine ligands L1 and L2 both form different metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies with Zn2+ and Cu2+ and these are shown to be toxic and selective towards cancer cell lines in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, potency and selectivity are highly dependent upon the metal ions, ligand system and bound anion, with significant changes in chemosensitivity and selectivity dependent upon which species are employed. Importantly, significant anti&#8208;tumor activity was observed in ovo at doses that are non&#8208;toxic.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an ultrathin MOF sheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) catalyst for selectively semihydrogenation of C2H2 into C2H4. Under C2H2 atmosphere, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic C2H2 hydrogenation in aqueous solution was achieved with TONC2H4 of 2124 and 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4. Even under competitive conditions (1.10&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H4 in C2H2), Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs can reduce the concentration of C2H2 to 5&#8197;ppm with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, proved its potential for application in polymer&#8208;grade ethylene production.







Abstract
The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalyst under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5&#8201;% after 12&#8197;h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8211;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10&#8201;% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.

         <title>Reversible Reactions of Nitric Oxide with a Binuclear Iron(III) Nitrophorin Mimic</title>

Strong attractive interactions between corrole subunits drive the release of nitric oxide from iron(III) nitrosyls, mimicking nitrophorin function.







Abstract
Construction of functional synthetic systems that can reversibly bind and transport the most biologically important gaseous molecules, oxygen and nitric oxide (NO), remains a contemporary challenge. Myoglobin and nitrophorin perform these respective tasks employing a protein&#8208;embedded heme center where one axial iron site is occupied by a histidine residue and the other is available for small molecule ligation, structural features that are extremely difficult to mimic in protein&#8208;free environments. Indeed, the hitherto reported designs rely on sophisticated multistep syntheses for limiting access to one of the two axial coordination sites in small molecules. We have shown previously that binuclear Ga(III) and Al(III) corroles have available axial sites, and now report a redox&#8208;active binuclear Fe(III) corrole, (1&#8208;Fe)2, in which each (corrolato)Fe(III) center is 5&#8208;coordinate, with one axial site occupied by an imidazole from the other corrole. The binuclear structure is further stabilized by attractive forces between the corrole &#960; systems. Reaction of NO with (1&#8208;Fe)2 affords mononuclear iron nitrosyls, and of functional relevance, the reaction is reversible: nitric oxide is released upon purging the nitrosyls with inert gases, thereby restoring (1&#8208;Fe)2 in solutions or films.

Design and synthesis of two new pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene, possessing high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29&#8197;kcal/mol and 40.76&#8197;kcal/mol based on TD&#8208;DFT calculation are described. Not only they can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals, but also display promising radiative cooling behavior.







Abstract
Two new pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes have been designed and synthesized in a three&#8208;step process, which are the first example of carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene. TD&#8208;DFT analyses indicate that both of them possess high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29&#8197;kcal/mol and 40.76&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. They emit strong red fluorescence and can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals upon addition of AgSbF6 evidenced by the bathochromic&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and the appearance of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. In addition, such helical derivatives can be chosen as radiative cooling materials in a glass model house, and the maxima of 5.4&#8201;&#176;C for the former and 6.5&#8201;&#176;C for the latter are found in the comparative tests, which might be caused by the NIR reflective response.

Simple two&#8208;step synthesis towards pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b][3]benzazepines and 7,11b&#8208;dihydro&#8208;6H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines from readily available (dihydro)isoquinolines is described.

Abstract
Under microwave (MW) irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and in the presence of nucleophiles (DMAP, triphenylphosphine and tetrahydrothiophene) 1&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2&#8208;vinyldi&#8208; and tetrahydroisoquinolines undergo [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement providing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b][3]benzazepines in good yields. The replacement of toluene with acetonitrile directs the rearrangement towards the formation of 7,11b&#8208;dihydro&#8208;6H&#8208;pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines.

         <title>Are &#8220;Carbon Dots&#8221; Always Carbon Dots? Evidence for their Supramolecular Nature from Structural and Dynamic Studies in Solution and in the Pure Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model unraveling the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, in which small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species present in dilute solution dynamically assemble into supramolecular organized structures when highly concentrated or in the solid state. (HR&#8208;TEM: high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, PFG&#8208;NMR: pulsed field gradient&#8208;NMR, TRFA: time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy).







Abstract
A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in the solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is proposed herein. Overwhelming evidence has been collected that links the data coming from solid&#8208;state analysis (high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG)&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species when the solvent is removed to give the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. This study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).

         <title>Selective Perchlorate Sensing Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SAMs of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils equipped with thioethers or dithiolane functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes were characterized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing both negative and positively charged redox couples revealed that derivatives equipped with benzyl methyl thioether, especially the lipoic amide group, were suitable for anion sensing measurements and bound perchlorate preferentially over other anions.







Abstract
In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils (semiaza&#8208;BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe, together with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors&#8242; packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration&#8208;dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza&#8208;BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8211;100&#8197;mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, I&#8722;, AcO&#8722;, H2PO4&#8722;, HPO42&#8722;, SO42&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, or CO32&#8722;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100&#8197;times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.

     alt="Selective Perchlorate Sensing Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self-Assembled Monolayers of semiaza-Bambusurils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAMs of novel &lt;i&gt;semiaza&lt;/i&gt;-bambus[6]urils equipped with thioethers or dithiolane functionalities as surface-anchoring groups on gold electrodes were characterized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing both negative and positively charged redox couples revealed that derivatives equipped with benzyl methyl thioether, especially the lipoic amide group, were suitable for anion sensing measurements and bound perchlorate preferentially over other anions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel &lt;i&gt;semiaza&lt;/i&gt;-bambus[6]urils (&lt;i&gt;semiaza&lt;/i&gt;-BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface-anchoring groups on gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;/4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as a redox probe, together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors&#8242; packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration-dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza-BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8211;100&#8197;mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, AcO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100&#8197;times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant total chemical synthesis route has been developed for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike&#8208;RBD. Leveraging a multi&#8208;segment convergent native chemical ligation strategy, this innovative approach holds immense promise in advancing the development of effective intervention strategies against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The highly efficient chemical synthesis method outlined here can be directly applied to the synthesis of other mutated variants or the mirror&#8208;image of the spike RBD for screening against peptide/protein&#8208;based library.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of this moderately large protein molecule. We discuss the problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized homogeneous spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of the spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.

         <title>Magnetic Relaxations of Chromium Nitride Porphyrinato Complexes Driven by the Anisotropic g&#8208;Factor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of chromium nitride (CrN2&#8722;)&#8208;porphyrinato complex revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does.







Abstract
Molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials are useful candidates as the spin qubit due to their long coherence time and high designability. The anisotropy of the g&#8208;values of the metal complexes can be utilized to access the individual spin of the metal complexes, making it possible to achieve the scalable molecular spin qubit. For this goal, it is important to evaluate the effect of g&#8208;value anisotropy on the magnetic relaxation behaviour. This study reports the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour of chromium nitride (CrN2+) porphyrinato complex (1), which is structurally and magnetically similar with the vanadyl (VO2+) porphyrinato complex (2) which is known as the excellent spin qubit. Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of 1 and 2 revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does. These results provide a design criterion for construction of multiple spin qubit based on g&#8208;tensor engineering.

A cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyzes the hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates. DFT calculations support a mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Amphoteric Reactivity of an Iron&#8208;Bispidine Complex</title>

A transient iron(III)&#8208;superoxido species in disguise orchestrates the reactivity of an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex stabilized in an engineered bispidine scaffold.







Abstract
The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8722;O bond cleavage that generates an FeIV&#8208;oxido species, the FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8722;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.

         <title>9&#8208;Azahomocubane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
9&#8208;Azahomocubane is unique amongst the nitrogen derivatives of homocubane, as it contains a secondary nitrogen atom, which can be used as a building block through amide bond formation. Herein reported is the first synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane, which was achieved via a rarely utilized Stieglitz rearrangement, and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis. The chemical stability of 9&#8208;azahomocubane exceeds that of the 1&#8208;azahomocubane, as predicted, although the basicity and calculated strain energy are similar.







Abstract
Homocubane, a highly strained cage hydrocarbon, contains two very different positions for the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the skeleton, e.&#8201;g., a position 1 exchange results in a tertiary amine whereas position 9 yields a secondary amine. Herein reported is the synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane along with associated structural characterization, physical property analysis and chemical reactivity. Not only is 9&#8208;azahomocubane readily synthesized, and found to be stable as predicted, the basicity of the secondary amine was observed to be significantly lower than the structurally related azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, although similar to 1&#8208;azahomocubane.

         <title>Oxidants Controlled C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryltetrahydroisoquinolines: The Construction of the Quaternary Carbon Center and Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond</title>

A C&#8722;H functionalization of &#945;&#8208;THIQ esters was achieved by triarylamine radical cation salt and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite, respectively, providing a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy THIQ esters and N&#8208;NO skeleton containing keto esters under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8722;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the N&#8208;nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.

         <title>Regulating the Interfacial Charge Density by Constructing a Novel Zn Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thepolar organic molecule amidinothiourea (ATU), as an electrolyte additive, can be stably adsorbed on the surface of zinc metal to construct the zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface and build new Zn&#8208;bond, promoting Zn2+ desolvation and deposition kinetics. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding network of the electrolyte can be reconstructed by ATU, which facilitates the migration of cation.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted considerable attention. However, due to the uneven distribution of charge density at Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface, severe dendrites and corrosion are generated during cycling. In this work, a facile and scalable strategy to address the above&#8208;mentioned issues has been proposed through regulating the charge density at Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. As a proof of concept, amidinothiourea (ATU) with abundant lone&#8208;pair electrons is employed as an interfacial charge modifier for Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The uniform and increased interfacial charge distribution on Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface has been obtained. Moreover, the unique Zn&#8208;bond constructed between N atoms and Zn2+ as well as the hydrogen bonds are formed among ATU and Ac&#8722; anion/active H2O, which promote the migration and desolvation behavior of Zn2+ at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Accordingly, at a trace concentration of 0.01&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 ATU, these features endow Zn anode with a long cycling life (more than 800&#8197;h), and a high average Columbic efficiency (99.52&#8201;%) for Zn||Cu batteries. When pairing with I2 cathode, the improved cycling ability (5000 cycles) with capacity retention of 77.9&#8201;% is achieved. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of charge density at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface can facilitate the development of AZIBs.

The highly condensed lithium nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x were prepared at pressures of 10&#8197;GPa in the multianvil press. Their structures were elucidated and their thermal stabilities and expansion coefficients were investigated. Synthesis of these materials closes a gap in the periodic table, as other alkali nitridophosphates like NaP4N7 or Na3P6N11 have been known for decades.







Abstract
Alkali nitridophosphates AP4N7 and A3P6N11 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been known for decades. However, their Li homologues have remained elusive. In this work, the highly condensed lithium (imido)nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x (x=1.66(3)) were synthesized from LiPN2 and P3N5 in the multianvil press at 10&#8197;GPa. They constitute the first lithium nitridophosphates with 3D networks exhibiting a degree of condensation larger than 0.5 and high thermal stability. LiP4N7 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a=4.5846(6)&#8197;&#197;, b=8.0094(11)&#8197;&#197;, and c=13.252(2)&#8197;&#197; (Z=4). Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with Z=2, a=4.6911(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=7.024(2)&#8197;&#197;, c=12.736(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=87.726(11), &#946;=80.279(11), and &#947;=70.551(12)&#176;. Both compounds are stable against hydrolysis in air.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide B was developed in 17&#8208;steps and a 2&#8201;% overall yield. The synthetic pathway opens a new route towards recently isolated cyanobactin's, especially for the balgacyclamide family and its analogs. Advanced intermediates from the synthetic pathway are being used to explore porin&#8208;mediated transportation in gram&#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
Balgacyclamide A&#8722;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2&#8201;% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.

         <title>Hauser&#8208;Kraus Annulation Initiated Multi&#8208;Cascade Reactions for Facile Access to Functionalized and Fused Oxazepines, Carbazoles and Phenanthridinediones</title>

Advancing on track. Several nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles such as dihydrobenzo[d]naphthooxazepine, benzo[a]carbazole and benzo[j]phenanthridine&#8208;7,12&#8208;dione are accessible by a base mediated reaction of 3&#8208;olefinic oxindole with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalide. This cascade synthesis involved several regioselective steps such as Hauser&#8208;Kraus annulation, ring cleavage (C&#8722;C&#963;), ring expansion, ring opening and ring contraction reactions in one pot. The formation of a new compound at every stage of the reaction by forming multiple new chemical bonds while proceeding to the title compound is another highlight of this reaction sequence. Further, the transformation generates stable and isolable medium rings. The complete mechanism of the reaction was rationalized by isolating and converting all stable intermediates to target compounds and by control experiments.







Abstract
The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8722;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8722;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.

[1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement can dearomatize aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles! Through a one&#8208;pot four&#8208;step process that includes lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement, and dearomatization reaction, we enable the formation of non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles with functional capabilities starting from readily available precursors. Subsequent functionalization reactions provide access to a diverse compound library.







Abstract
The [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement stands as a potent technique for constructing complex molecules. In this study, we showcase its power in the dearomatization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles. Through a concise four&#8208;step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo&#8208;pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening of 1,3&#8208;Imidazole Based Mesoionic Carbenes (iMICs) and Ring&#8208;Closing Clicks: Facile Access to iMIC&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable unmasked iMICs are extremely scarce and have limited shelf&#8208;life. An unprecedented ring&#8208;opening of iMICs to N&#8208;ethynylformimidamides (eFIMs) has been reported. eFIMs are thermally stable under an inert atmosphere and show moderately air&#8208;stability. They are excellent iMIC&#8208;surrogates and readily undergo ring&#8208;closing&#8208;clicks with a variety of (non)metal Lewis acids, affording iMIC&#8208;compounds (iMIC)[M] with zero waste and easy workup.







Abstract
Herein, ring&#8208;opening of mesoionic carbenes (iMICs) (iMIC=[ArC{N(Dipp)}2C(SiMe3)C:) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, Ar=Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 or 4&#8208;PhC6H4) based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole scaffold to yield N&#8208;ethynylformimidamide (eFIM) derivatives as crystalline solids (eFIM={(Dipp)N=C(Ar)N(Dipp)}C&#8801;CSiMe3) is reported. eFIMs are thermally stable under inert gas atmosphere and show moderate air stability (t1/2=3&#8197;h for Ar=Ph). eFIMs are excellent surrogates of iMICs, which generally have a limited shelf&#8208;life, and readily undergo ring&#8208;closing click reactions with a variety of main&#8208;group as well as transition metal Lewis acids to form hitherto challenging iMIC&#8208;compounds in good to excellent yields. In addition to the relevance of eFIMs in the synthesis of iMIC&#8208;compounds, quantification of the stereoelectronic properties of a representative iMIC (Ar=Ph) by experimental and theoretical methods suggests remarkably &#963;&#8208;donor property and steric profile of these new ligand sets.

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction that involves the direct functionalization of insert C&#8722;H bond represents one of the most efficient carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming strategy. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H bond arylation of triarylphosphonate is reported to access cyclic biarylphosphonates targets. The reaction is achieved via an unique eight&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate and show good functional group compatibility under mild reaction condition.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions that involve the direct functionalization of insert C&#8722;H bond represent one of the most efficient strategies for forming carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H bond arylation of triaryl phosphates is reported to access seven&#8208;membered cyclic biarylphosphonate targets. The reaction is achieved via a unique eight&#8208;membered palladacyclic intermediate and shows good functional group compatibility. Meanwhile, the product can be readily converted into other valuable phosphate compounds.

The depicted model unveils the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs), which in dilute solution are in fact individual small&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;sized molecular species that only assemble into supramolecular organized structures when in the solid state. The image also alludes to the main techniques that allowed coherent correlations to be established between the morphology of CDs in the solid state (HRTEM) and the solution properties. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;V. Prata and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302955).

Owing to the advantages of high surface area, tenable polygonal porosity, predictable and stable structure, and precise chemical control, covalent organic frameworks offer numerous potential in addressing the crucial points for sensing application. Here, we systematically review recent chemical sensors based on covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of crystalline porous polymer composed of light elements through strong covalent bonds. COFs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique designable structures and excellent material properties. Currently, COFs have shown outstanding potential in various fields, including gas storage, pollutant removal, catalysis, adsorption, optoelectronics, and their research in the sensing field is also increasingly flourishing. In this review, we focus on COF&#8208;based sensors. Firstly, we elucidate the fundamental principles of COF&#8208;based sensors. Then, we present the primary application areas of COF&#8208;based sensors and their recent advancements, encompassing gas, ions, organic compounds, and biomolecules sensing. Finally, we discuss the future trends and challenges faced by COF&#8208;based sensors, outlining their promising prospects in the field of sensing.

Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) exhibit a series of significant advantages in sensing. FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors have been well developed and widely applied in environmental and biological fields. In this review, the preparation methodologies, sensing mechanisms, and applications in solutions and biospecimens of FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors are summarized and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the N&#8208;Hydroxylations Catalyzed by the&#160;Binuclear Iron Domain of SznF enzyme: Key Piece in the Synthesis of Streptozotocin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SznF, a member of the emerging family of heme&#8208;oxygenase&#8208;like (HO&#8208;like) di&#8208;iron oxidases and oxygenases, employs two distinct domains to catalyze the conversion of N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;NMA) into N&#8208;nitroso&#8208;containing product, which can subsequently be transformed into streptozotocin. Using unrestricted density functional theory (UDFT) with the hybrid functional B3LYP, we have mechanistically investigated the two sequential hydroxylations of L&#8208;NMA catalyzed by SznF's binuclear iron central domain. Mechanism B primarily involves the O&#8208;O bond dissociation, forming Fe(IV)=O, induced by the H+/e&#8722; introduction to the FeA side of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;Fe2(III/III), the substrate hydrogen abstraction by Fe(IV)=O, and the hydroxyl rebound to the substrate N radical. The stochastic addition of H+/e&#8722; to the FeB side (mechanism C) can transition to mechanism B, thereby preventing enzyme deactivation. Two other competing mechanisms, involving the direct O&#8208;O bond dissociation (mechanism A) and the addition of H2O as a co&#8208;substrate (mechanism D), have been ruled out.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>

Modelling &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes. We employed a bulky, tripodal N,N,O phenolate ligand to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;acid complex. This unique, pentacoordinate complex is a close structural model of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron enzymes. The complex undergoes rapid decarboxylation when exposed to O2, thereby mirroring important aspects of native enzyme reactivity.







Abstract
A bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964;=0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S=3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). A small amount of hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high&#8208;performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.







Abstract
The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Phosphinidenes: Fundamental Properties and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidenes are very reactive compounds containing a monocoordinated phosphorus atom, and this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds serves as versatile intermediates in synthetic phosphorus chemistry. In this Concept we will review the recent experimental progresses in probing the fundamental properties of the prototype phosphinidenes in the triplet and singlet state.







Abstract
Phosphinidenes are heavy congeners of nitrenes that have been broadly used as in&#8197;situ reagents in synthetic phosphorus chemistry and also serve as versatile ligands in coordination with transition metals. However, the detection of free phosphinidenes is largely challenged by their high reactivity and also the lack of suitable synthetic methods, rendering the knowledge about the fundamental properties of this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds limited. Recently, an increasing number of free phosphinidenes bearing prototype structural and bonding properties have been prepared for the first time, thus enabling the exploration of their distinct reactivity from the nitrene analogues. This Concept article will discuss the experimental approaches for the generation of the highly unstable phosphinidenes and highlight their distinct reactivity from the nitrogen analogues so as to stimuate future studies about their potential applications in phosphorus chemistry.

         <title>Zeolite/Polymer Composites Prepared by Photopolymerization: Effect of Compensation Cations on Opacity and Gas Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphical abstract: The composition of zeolite influences the photopolymerization process of zeolite/polymer&#8208;based composites. The nature of compensation cations was examined to determine their effect on the opacity of the cured composite (via colorimetric analyses) and on the gas adsorption properties (for water, carbon dioxide and 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene) on calcined composites.

The fabrication of structured zeolite adsorbents through photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing which offers a solution to the limitations of conventional shaping techniques has been demonstrated but many parameters still need to be optimized. In this study, we studied the influence of zeolite compensation cations on the photopolymerization and the composite's properties. Modified zeolites (LTA 4&#8197;A and FAU 13X exchanged with K+, Li+, Sr2+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405&#8197;nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650&#8201;&#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4&#8197;A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.

         <title>Heterometallic AuI6AgI6 Macrocyclic Cluster Templated by a Supramolecular Melamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AuI6AgI6 macrocyclic cluster has been constructed by a supramolecular templating approach. The bilayered tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 held together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is observed for the first time, and it is important for the highly ordered alignment of metal atoms. The supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites present a facile approach to functional metal clusters.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular templates in aligning atomically precise heterometal arrays is important for pursuing functional materials. Herein, we report that a bilayered supramolecular tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer functions as an effective template in the construction of a heterometallic gold(I)&#8208;silver(I) macrocyclic cluster [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2&#8722;AuI6AgI6. X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analysis showed that a crown&#8208;like AuI6AgI6 macrocycle is aligned around two parallelly stacked &#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722; moieties hold together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Theoretical calculations revealed that the [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 motif dominantly contributes to the near&#8208;occupied orbitals in the electronic structure, which is closely related to its luminescence properties. This work demonstrates that the supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites may present a facile approach in the construction of functional metal clusters.

         <title>Cu(I) Complexes Comprising tetrahedral Mo2E2 or Mo2PE units (E=P, As, Sb) as Chelating Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The coordination chemistry of the homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;dinuclear tetrahedral molybdenum complexes [Mo2E2] (E=P, As, Sb) and [Mo2PE] (E=As, Sb) towards [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] are presented showing structural evidence of the side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the tetrahedral [Mo2PE] and [Mo2E2] complexes and a rare &#951;1&#8208;coordination of the [Mo2PSb] complex.







Abstract
Novel isomorphous tetranuclear complexes, [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=P (1), As (4), Sb (5), (dppf=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;ferrocene)] and [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=As (2), Sb(3)] were synthesized from the reactions between [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] and tetrahedral molybdenum complexes containing unsubstituted homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;diatomic group&#8208;15 elements [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=P (A), As (D), Sb (E)] and [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=As (B), Sb (C)], respectively. In all these products, the {Mo2E2} or {Mo2PE} moieties coordinate the Cu(I) center via a rare side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination mode. The X&#8208;ray structure analyses of [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;PSb{CpMo(CO)2}2][BF4] demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of an &#951;1&#8208;coordination mode for the ligand complex C to coordinate to the Cu(I) center. All the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Electrochemical studies also revealed the formation of 1&#8211;5, and, further, to understand the structure and bonding of the products, theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were conducted.

         <title>Characterization by Gel Permeation Chromatography of the Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers Generated by Forming Polyrotaxanes through the Introduction of External Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers find wide applications across diverse domains, and the molecular weight exerts a critical influence on their applicability. Consequently, the measurement of molecular weight for supramolecular polymers assumes paramount significance. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) requiring low&#8208;concentration condition is a common characterization employed for molecular weight determination, which is not suitable for supramolecular polymers possessing concentration&#8208;independence property. Here, to break this threshold, we synthesized M1 embodying dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moiety as well as dibenzylammonium salt (DBA) group, which was capable of self&#8208;assembling into supramolecular polymers terminated with aldehyde groups at its end. Upon the addition of (4&#8208; (1,2,2&#8208;Triphenylvinyl) phenyl) methylamine (TPE&#8208;NH2), supramolecular polymers underwent a transition into polyrotaxanes, for which it was led by the generation of imine bonds. By virtue of GPC, the molecular weight of polyrotaxanes was obtained, then it was available to gain the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers with the help of transformation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches was designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high overall thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, while maintaining satisfactory photoconversion rates. High&#8208;quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved, and the light was shed on the mechanism of photoisomerization and de&#8208;excitation processes.







Abstract
Triarylhydrazones represent an attractive class of photochromic compounds offering many interesting features including high molar absorptivity, good addressability, and extraordinary thermal stability. In addition, unlike most other hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches, they effectively absorb light above 365&#8197;nm. However, previously prepared triaryhydrazones suffer from low quantum yields of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization. Here, we have designed a new subclass of naphthoyl&#8208;benzothiazole hydrazones that balance the most beneficial features of previously reported naphthoyl&#8208;quinoline and benzoyl&#8208;pyridine triarylhydrazones. These preserve the attractive absorption characteristics, exhibit higher thermal stability of the metastable form than the former and enhance the rate of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization compared to the later, as a result of the weakening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrazone hydrogen and the benzothiazole moiety. Introducing the benzothiazole motif extends the tunability of the photochromic behaviour of hydrazone&#8208;based switches.

         <dc:description>
Biological evaluation of cuneane analogs of ketoprofen, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug having m&#8208;substituted benzene moiety, was conducted. This study was inspired from the structural similarity of 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes with m&#8208;substituted benzene. Selective isomerization of 1,4&#8208;substituted cubanes into 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes enabled this evaluation. Biological evaluation of the synthesized analogs of ketoprofen and in silico study of the result of biological study revealed a potential isosteric usage of cuneane skeleton as a m&#8208;substituted benzenes in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We herein evaluate a biological applicability of 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes as an isostere of m&#8208;substituted benzenes based on its structural similarity. An investigation of a method to obtain 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes by selective isomerization of 1,4&#8208;substituted cubanes enables this attempt by giving a key synthetic step to obtain a cuneane analogs of pharmaceuticals having m&#8208;substituted benzene moiety. Biological evaluation of the synthesized analogs and in silico study of the obtained result revealed a potential usage of cuneane skeleton in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported the one&#8208;pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. A new BODIPY with helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton and intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption was developed.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1&#8201;b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear gold(I) complexes with ferrocenylphosphane and different bridging ligands such as, chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate have a significant influence in their reactivity. Chloride&#8208;bridged complexes excel as highly efficient catalysts, while thiolate&#8208;bridged ones exhibit varied conversion rates. Additionally, the use of monophosphane or diphosphane ligands introduces intriguing performance differences, offering prospects for customized catalytic systems.







Abstract
The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic &#8220;self&#8208;activated&#8221; precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.

         <title>Incorporating Photoresponses into Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous liquids are a relatively new class of porous material, and while a large proportion of research has been aimed at improving gas capacity and selectivity, there has been less focus on the selective and controllable release of gas from within the material. With a handful of examples now reported, we discuss the concept of photoresponsive porous liquids, aimed at invoking a change in the gas capacity on irradiation with light, and discuss important factors in their design, alongside potential strategies for the realisation of further systems.







Abstract
Porous liquids combine the properties of a porous solid with those of a liquid, creating a porous flowable media. Since their discovery, these materials have gathered widespread interest within the scientific community, with substantial numbers of new systems being discovered, often with a focus on increasing the pore volume and gas capacity. Which begs the question, what does the future hold for porous liquids? Recently, the first examples of photoresponsive porous liquids have emerged, allowing changes in porosity to be observed under UV irradiation. Here, we expand on our previous report of photoresponsive porous liquids and explore the conceptualisation of responsive porous liquids and how these materials could be developed with the ability to respond to light, thereby offering a potential mechanism of controllable uptake and release in these systems. This concept article summarises different approaches that could be used to incorporate a photoresponse in a porous liquid before discussing recently reported systems, alongside important factors to consider in their design. Finally, by taking inspiration from the methods used to translate porous solids into the liquid state, combined with the field of photoresponsive materials, we discuss potential strategies that could be employed to realise further examples of photoresponsive porous liquids.

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence (EDIEA) is an efficient approach to bicyclic fused and bridged mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks. The method is applicable for the multigram preparation of the target compounds, which is illustrated by synthesis of over 50 building blocks on up to 150&#8197;g scale. Physicochemical and structural parameters of the title scaffolds illustrate their utility as promising benzene and cycloalkane isosteres and provide a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compound's properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.&#8201;e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets; a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of 1D covalent organic frameworks perpendicularly on the surface of GO nanosheets, a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D design, improves the photocatalytic performance for many tandem oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Under white light irradiation, 1D COF nanorods exhibit a superior visible light activity. The improved charge transfer and desirable separation rate obtain through the junction between COR and GO sheets.







Abstract
Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicular to the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&#8722;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional PVdF binders still remain some limitations to its use for high&#8208;voltage transition metal oxide cathodes (TMOCs). This review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide cathodes (TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.

         <dc:description>
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor agonists are used for the treatment of asthma, but also play a role in heart diseases. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;receptor agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized and one adrenaline derivative is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar, trans&#8208;on, full agonist for the &#946;2&#8208;receptor. It represents a novel molecular probe for biological studies with high structural similarity to native adrenaline.







Abstract
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2&#8208;AR) agonists are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also play a role in other complex disorders including cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. As the cellular and molecular mechanisms in various cells and tissues of the &#946;2&#8208;AR remain vastly elusive, we developed tools for this investigation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;AR agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized. The most potent agonist for &#946;2&#8208;AR with reasonable switching is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar active, trans&#8208;on arylazopyrazole&#8208;based adrenaline derivative and comprises valuable photopharmacological properties for further biological studies with high structural accordance to the native ligand adrenaline.

         <title>Improved Interface Construction on Anode and Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ultralow&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Containing Dual&#8208;Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3 M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17% (baseline) to 79% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB) and 83% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB and 1.0 wt % TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaphosphinate Dyes: A Low Molecular Weight Near&#8208;Infrared Scaffold for Development of Photoacoustic or Fluorescence Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are desirable for biological imaging applications including photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes which display desirable properties such as low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750 nm, and remarkable water solubility. In PA imaging, an azaphosphinate dye exhibited a 4.1&#8208;fold enhancement in intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in whole blood, imaging depths of 2.75 cm in a tissue model, and contrast in mice. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &gt;10&#8208;fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micro&#8208;supercapacitors, emerging as promising micro&#8208;energy storage devices, have attracted significant attention due to their unique features. This comprehensive review focuses on two key aspects: the scalable fabrication of MSCs and their diverse applications. The review begins by elucidating the energy storage mechanisms and guiding principles for designing high&#8208;performance devices. It subsequently explores recent advancements in scalable fabrication techniques for electrode materials and micro&#8208;nano fabrication processes for micro&#8208;devices. The discussion encompasses critical application domains, including multifunctional MSCs, energy storage integration, integrated power generation, and integrated applications. Despite notable progress, there are still some challenges such as large&#8208;scale production of electrode material, well&#8208;controlled fabrication technology, and scalable integrated manufacture. The summary concludes by emphasizing the need for future research to enhance micro&#8208;supercapacitor performance, reduce production costs, achieve large&#8208;scale production, and explore synergies with other energy storage technologies. This collective effort aims to propel MSCs from laboratory innovation to market viability, providing robust energy storage solutions for MEMS and portable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8208; (Ae = Be &#8208; Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&#8208; (Ae = Be &#8208; Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge&#8208; and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae = Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&#8208; donate electronic charge into the vacant spx(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond AeF&#8208;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n&#8208;1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&#8208; that leads to quadruply bonded AeF&#8208; (Ae = Ca &#8211; Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36% and 75% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Functions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness is studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolation Assisted Morphology Transformation of Prebiotic Lipidated&#8208;cationic Amino Acids: Electro&#8208;droplet Mediated C&#8208;C Coupling Reaction to Synthesize Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization protected biomolecules from the fluctuating environments of early Earth. Although contemporary cells mostly use phospholipid&#8208;based bilayer membranes, the utility of non&#8208;bilayer compartments was not ruled out during the prebiotic and modern eras. In the present study, we demonstrated the prebiotic synthesis of lipidated cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles (lauryl ester of lysine, Lys; ornithine, Orn; and 2,4&#8208;diamino butyric acid, Dab) using model dry&#8208;down reaction. Orn, and Dab&#8208;based amphiphiles (OrnL and DabL) self&#8208;assemble into micellar membranes but undergo pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolation assisted transformation to lipid droplet&#8208;like morphologies, a probable alternative compartment model in the prebiotic Earth. These cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules (isoprene) and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize isoprenoid derivatives at primitive Earth conditions. The self&#8208;assembly of prebiotic amphiphiles, their transformation to droplet compartments, and droplet&#8208;assisted C&#8208;C bond formation reaction might help the evolution to synthesize various biomolecules required for the origin of life.</dc:description>

         <title>CBe2H5&#8211;: unprecedented 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity and dynamic structural fluxionality in a planar tetracoordinate carbon cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8211; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom is designed herein. Remarkably, it can be stabilized by only two beryllium atoms with both &#960;&#8208;acceptor/&#963;&#8208;donor properties and two hydrogen atoms, which means that the conversion from planar methane (transition state) to ptC species (global minimum) requires the substitution of only two hydrogen atoms. Moreover, two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, giving rise to interesting dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. The electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of ligand H atoms due to C&#8208;H localized bonds, highlighting the rotational fluxionality in the cluster, and two CBe2 3c&#8208;2e delocalized bonds endow its rare 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process exhibits a conversion in the type of bonding (&#963; bond &#8660; &#960; bond), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster can be seen as an attempt to apply planar hypercoordinate carbon species to molecular motors.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient C&#8208;Si/C&#8208;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8208;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>CARBON DOTS: Bioimaging and Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer, responsible for approximately 10 million lives annually, urgently requires innovative treatments, as well as solutions to mitigate the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as long&#8208;term adverse side effects and multidrug resistance. This review focuses on Carbon Dots (CDs), an emergent class of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable physicochemical and biological properties, and their burgeoning applications in bioimaging and as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The review initiates with an overview of NPs as nanocarriers, followed by an in&#8208;depth look into the biological barriers that could affect their distribution, from barriers to administration, to intracellular trafficking. It explores CDs' synthesis,&#160;both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches, and their notable biocompatibility, supported by a selection of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies. Special attention is given to CDs' role in bioimaging, highlighting their optical properties. The discussion extends to their emerging significance as drug carriers, particularly in the delivery of doxorubicin and other anticancer agents, underscoring recent advancements and challenges in this field with examples of other promising bioapplications, emergent owing to the NPs flexible design. As research on CDs evolves, we envisage key challenges, as well as the potential of CD&#8208;based systems in bioimaging and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Photoacoustic Imaging of Localized Cysteine in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Enabled by A Totally&#8208;Caged Methylene Blue Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the 90th anniversary of South China Normal University.It developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) towards the localized cysteine. This work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue&#8208;based probe for cysteine (MB&#8208;Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;&#8208;conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665&#8197;nm (&gt;130&#8208;fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high&#8208;contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide, PPI, is reported. Introduction of two P atoms to the indenyl core results in considerable biradical character. Moreover, the ligand properties of PPI are investigated using a chromium tricarbonyl complex as model compound.







Abstract
Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS=trimethylsilyl, R=p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5).

     alt="Phosphonium-substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a phosphonium-substituted diphosphaindenylide, PPI, is reported. Introduction of two P atoms to the indenyl core results in considerable biradical character. Moreover, the ligand properties of PPI are investigated using a chromium tricarbonyl complex as model compound.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the TMS-substituted ylide (TMS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (TMS=trimethylsilyl, R=&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tolyl), the phosphonium-substituted diphosphaindenylide &lt;b&gt;PPI&lt;/b&gt; was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in &lt;b&gt;PPI&lt;/b&gt;. Reaction with [Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] affords the complex [Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of metal nanoparticles loaded COFs catalysts have been prepared via one&#8208;pot construction strategy without lab&#8208;cost procedures, demonstrating excellent hydrogenation performance under mild conditions. The new strategy can be further evolved as into a versatile platform to create new COFs materials and explore the resultant applications.







Abstract
The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99&#8201;% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development for the construction of peptidomimetics via Ugi reactions or post&#8208;Ugi transformations. By the combination of Ugi reaction and transition metal catalysis such as gold, palladium, rhodium and copper, as well as metal&#8208;free strategies, devise linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics are prepared in a rapid, highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner.







Abstract
Peptidomimetics have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many efforts have been made to synthesize various peptidomimetics. Among them, the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear peptidomimetic. In order to obtain other linear, cyclic or polycyclic peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations. This review covers the years from 2018&#8211;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions, and metal&#8208;free reactions toward peptidomimetics are highlighted.

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is crucial to improve various industrial and biotechnological processes. In this study, we successfully designed a hemin&#8208;based ArM with peroxidase activity. Our results reveal improved properties compared to the activity of free hemin. Moreover, we also achieved the fabrication of this ArM in&#8197;vitro and in emulsio.







Abstract
Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in&#8197;vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.

         <title>A New Series of Sandwich&#8208;Type 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Biterphenylenes: Synthetic Challenge, Structural Uniqueness and Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crowded biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes, contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches. This unique structure provides an ideal model for studying the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, properties and aromaticity.







Abstract
A new series of biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes (BLTPs), were prepared using the tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key synthetic step. The three&#8208;dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)&#8208;substituted BLTPs are highly crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8722;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol). These structures contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches, where the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; (TSPP) interactions are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, reduction of oxidation potentials, increasing aromaticity of the central six&#8208;membered ring and decreasing antiaromaticity of the four&#8208;membered rings in a terphenylenyl moiety based on NICS(0) and iso&#8208;chemical shielding surfaces. Despite the restricted C&#8722;C bond associated intramolecular TSPP interactions for BLTPs in the ground state, to our surprise, the electronic coupling between two linear terphenylenes (LTPs) in BLTPs in the excited state is weak, so that the excited&#8208;state behavior is dominated by the corresponding monomeric LTPs. In other words, all BLTPs undergo ultrafast relaxation dynamics via strong exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, acting as a blue&#8208;light absorber with essentially no emission.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous COFs (HP&#8208;COFs) refers to the integration of hierarchical pore distributions, which may include micropore, mesopore and macropore within one porous system. In this article, we introduce the synthesis methods of HP&#8208;COFs, encompassing topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. Simultaneously, we briefly introduce the applications of HP&#8208;COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cutting&#8208;Edge Materials for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Water Harvesting from Air</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exemplify up&#8208;and&#8208;coming crystalline porous materials characterized by spectacular specific surface areas, adjustable pore environments, and superb physicochemical stabilities. This Review highlights the enormous potential and recent advances of COFs for carbon dioxide trapping and water harvesting from air, in addition to highlighting the key challenges and future research directions.







Abstract
The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Organogel Constructed Using Riboflavin and Melamine: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed Colorimetric Chiral Sensing and Enantioselective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives produces a chiral supramolecular organogel, which acts as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor and a chiral adsorbent that enables colorimetric chiral discrimination and optical resolution.







Abstract
The synthesis of a chiral supramolecular organogel via the hierarchical helical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives is described herein. Owing to the photocatalysis of riboflavin and the supramolecular chirality induced in the helically stacked riboflavin/melamine complex, the gel is observed to act as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor of optically active alcohols by detecting the change in color from yellow to green. The gel also served as an efficient chiral adsorbent, enabling optical resolution of a racemic compound with high chiral recognition ability.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthetic approach and the characterization of a family of highly water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;PBI donor&#8208;acceptor amphiphiles by the utilization of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid capped Newkome dendrons. The amphiphiles form stable aggregates in basic aqueous solutions. The amphiphiles can be individualized by the addition of THF, which manifests itself, for example, in the reinstatement of fluorescence emission.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a family of three water&#8208;soluble bola&#8208;amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide triads containing oligo carboxylic&#8208;acid capped Newkome dendrons in the periphery. Variations of the perylenebisimide (PBI) core geometry and dendron size (G1 and G2 dendrons with 3&#8208; and 9&#8208;carboxylic acid groups respectively) allow for tuning the supramolecular aggregation behavior with respect to variation of the molecular architecture. The triads show good solubility in basic aqueous media and aggregation to supramolecular assemblies. Theoretical investigations at the DFT level of theory accompanied by electrochemical measurements unravel the geometric and electronic structure of the amphiphiles. UV/Vis and fluorescence titrations with varying amounts of THF demonstrate disaggregation.

         <title>Cyclic Hydrocarbon Frameworks Containing Two Bismuth Atoms: Towards 9,10&#8208;Dibismaanthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dinuclear bismuth heterocycles featuring the dihydro&#8208;dibismaanthrace structural motif are presented. These compounds involve bismuth halides, selenides, and heterobimetallic bismuth / transition&#8208;metal compounds with a versatile coordination chemistry. Synthetic access to the low&#8208;valent highly reactive dibismaanthracene (the so&#8208;called bismanthrene) has been probed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based bismanthrene surrogates are suggested.







Abstract
When bismuth atoms are incorporated into cyclic organic systems, this commonly goes along with strained or distorted molecular geometries, which can be exploited to modulate the physical and chemical properties of these compounds. In six&#8208;membered heterocycles, bismuth atoms are often accompanied by oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen as a second hetero&#8208;element. In this work, we present the first examples of six&#8208;membered rings, in which two CH units are replaced by BiX moieties (X=Cl, Br, I), resulting in dihydro&#8208;anthracene analogs. Their behavior in chemically reversible reduction reactions is explored, aiming at the generation of dibisma&#8208;anthracene (bismanthrene). Heterometallic compounds (Bi/Fe, Bi/Mn) are introduced as potential bismanthrene surrogates, as supported by bismanthrene&#8208;transfer to selenium. Analytical techniques used to investigate the reported compounds include NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have a high specific capacity and energy density to become the most promising high&#8208;energy storage system in the future. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong polysulfides adsorption to overcome the drawbacks of low conductivity and the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of Li&#8722;S batteries. This review summarizes different preparation methods and properties of MXenes and their cathode application in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and have become the most promising high&#8208;energy storage system for the next generation batteries technology. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups, and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of the sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Significant achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to Li&#8722;S cathodes are concluded later. Finally, the challenges, possible solutions and potential applications of MXenes for Li&#8722;S batteries are also presented.

         <title>Ca(II) and Yb(II) complexes featuring M(C&#8801;C)4 structural motif: enforced proximity or genuine &#951;2&#8208;bonding?</title>

The &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the alkyne triple C&#8801;C bond to Ca2+ and Yb2+ ions in the 1,8&#8208;bis(ethynyl)substituted carbazolide complexes is confirmed in the solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and in the solution by NMR spectroscopy. QTIAM analysis proves the existence of M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C) T&#8208;shaped bond pathways.







Abstract
Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R=SiMe3, n=0, M=Ca, Yb; R=Ph, n=1, M=Ca, Yb; n=0, M=Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution. According to QTAIM analysis there are 4 bond critical points (3;&#8722;1) between the metal atom and each of the triple bonds, which are connected by a strongly curved, almost T&#8208;shaped bond pathway.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition was fabricated. The host dimer M1 which exhibits blue fluorescence was prepared by decorating benzo[15]crown&#8208;5 with a quinoline group. M1 can crosslink the ammonium cations&#8208;grafted polymer P1 to form a supramolecular polymer networks through host&#8208;guest recognition, accompanied by the transformation of blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light Irradiated Mn(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylation and C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkanes with C(sp2)&#8722;H Bonds of Quinones for Alkylated Hydroxy Quinones and Parvaquone</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated alkanes using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any utilization of external base, oxidant, and pre&#8208;functionalization is described. Using the presented methodology, the high&#8208;value&#8208;added compound parvaquone (a commercially available drug for treating theileriosis) and its derivatives can be directly constructed under ambient reaction conditions.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre&#8208;functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized in&#8197;situ by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat theileriosis) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear&#8208;, branched&#8208;, and cyclo&#8208;alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue&#8208;light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.

         <title>Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI&#8208;trityl dyads and triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromophore&#8208;radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high&#8208;spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8208;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.&#8201;g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8208;chromophore&#8208;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One allogon hardly ever comes alone but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO2 core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O2 proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped&#8208;flow measurements.







Abstract
Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One allogon hardly ever comes alone&lt;/b&gt; but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped-flow measurements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deprotonation of O(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with LiO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu followed by reaction with FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in THF led to the complex [&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe][Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;-Fe sites of Fe/ZSM-5. Reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adduct could not be identified by stopped-flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; entity. Hence, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Hierarchically Porous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks were summarized, including the macrocycle structures, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically porous structures.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous crystalline materials. The pores in HOFs are usually non&#8208;covalent extrinsic pores constructed through the formation of the framework. Supramolecular macrocycles with intrinsic pores in their structures are good candidates for constructing HOFs with intrinsic pores from the macrocycles themselves, thus leading to hierarchically porous structures. Combining the macrocycle and HOFs will endow these hierarchically porous materials with enhanced properties and special functionalities. This review summarizes recent advances in macrocycle&#8208;based HOFs, including the macrocycles used for constructing HOFs, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically HOFs porous structures. This review provides insights for future research on macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous HOFs and the appropriate applications of the unique structures.

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor&#8208;stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The syntheses and characterizations of alkyl&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (E=P, As; R=alkyl) are presented. Together with other donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes, these compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 and their ligand properties evaluated regarding the steric and electronic nature of this class of compounds. According to the corresponding Tolman Electronic Parameters, the compounds are significantly more electron&#8208;rich than regular phosphines and their steric and electronic demands can be modified easily.







Abstract
A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E=P, As; R2=Me2, Ph2, tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.

         <title>Double Four Ring Units&#8208;Containing Zeolites: Synthesis, Structural Modification and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of three categories of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites: germanosilicates, silicates, and aluminosilicates. A new classification rule, based on the difference in the connection modes between the d4r units and Si&#8208;rich frameworks, is carried out on these structurally specific zeolites. Various synthetic approaches are discussed and compared for developing novel germanosilicates, inducing structural transformation and stabilizing the frameworks.







Abstract
In zeolite frameworks, double four&#8208;ring (d4r) configurations are among the most frequent composite building units. The composition variations in d4r units greatly influence the energy and structural modifiability of the zeolitic framework. The introduction of germanium, with a larger ionic radius than silicon or aluminum, not only reduces the energy constraints of d4r in the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolites, but also opens a new window for constructing novel crystalline structures, especially with large or extra&#8208;large pores and channels. Ge&#8208;enriched d4r units endow germanosilicates with structure diversity readily for post treatments. Promising catalytic materials have been gradually developed and increasingly studied by direct synthesis or post&#8208;synthetic isomorphous substitution for Ge. This review focuses on the recent progress in the synthesis, modification, and catalytic application of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites, including germanosilicates, aluminosilicates, and silicates.

A metal&#8208;free protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective thioarylation at the C3 position of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo) is presented. The transformation of these derivatives into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates was achieved through an acid&#8208;driven deprotection/aromatization sequence. Experimental studies and NMR analyses were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free coupling protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective C3&#8208;thioarylation of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo). The developed procedure enables the coupling of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and hindered arylthiols, providing a series of C3&#8208;modified iminoKdo derivatives in moderate to good yields. Elucidation of active species through controlled experimental studies and time&#8208;lapse 31P NMR analysis provides insights into the reaction mechanism. We demonstrate that, following a tandem Staudinger/aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of an azido&#8208;containing keto ester, an inseparable equimolar mixture of imine/enamine is formed. The enamine then undergoes a Stork&#8208;like nucleophilic attack with the in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed disulfide reagent, resulting in the formation of the coupling products. Additionally, we describe a rarely reported acid&#8208;promoted aromatization of the C3&#8208;thioarylated iminoKdo skeleton into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates, which are reminiscent of dichotomines.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids are known to be modified by natural polyphenols via amination. This study investigates the oxidative coupling mechanisms between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles, using in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. It is shown that polyphenols with a pyrogallol substructure and an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the C4a&#8208;position are most effective. These insights can play a crucial role in drug design against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8722;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8722;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in&#8197;vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.

         <title>Carbonylation as a Key Step in New Tandem Reactions &#8211; A Route to BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence for BODIPYs is presented. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78&#8201;% showed that we were able to expand the range of readily accessible BODIPYs while demonstrating the general applicability and advantages of our developed method.







Abstract
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to BODIPYs is presented. The key step is the combination of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation to yield dipyrromethanes, which are further converted to the corresponding BODIPY. Classic syntheses towards BODIPYs have relied on aldehydes or acid chlorides, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive to handle. The presented approach starts from readily available and stable alkenes or aryl&#8208;bromides, which allows to extend the range of readily available BODIPYs that can be tailored for their specific use. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78&#8201;% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the presented method.

         <title>Tridentate NacNac Tames T&#8208;Shaped Nickel(I) Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally stable, T&#8208;shaped, nickel(I) radical was straightforward obtained by reduction of a tridentate nacnac nickel(II) chloride with KSi(TMS)3. The metalloradical character of the compound was demonstrated by the formation of a highly unusual nickeloxaziridine complex upon addition of TEMPO. The Ni(I) species displays a rich chemistry towards activation S&#8722;S, and Se&#8722;Se bond leading to unusual C&#8722;C coupled product as well as dihydrogen activation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to generate monomeric nickel hydride.







Abstract
The reaction of a nickel(II) chloride complex containing a tridentate &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand with a picolyl group [2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3NC(Me)CHC(Me)NH(CH2py)]Ni(II)Cl (1)] with KSi(SiMe3)3 conveniently afforded a nickel(I) radical with a T&#8208;shaped geometry (2). The compound&#8216;s metalloradical nature was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and its reaction with TEMPO, resulting in the formation of a highly unusual three&#8208;membered nickeloxaziridine complex (3). When reacted with disulfide and diselenide, the S&#8722;S and Se&#8722;Se bonds were cleaved, and a coupled product was formed through carbon atom of the pyridine&#8208;imine group. The nickel(I) radical activates dihydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to give the monomeric nickel hydride.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Pyrene&#8208;decorated Planar Chiral [2,2]Paracyclophanes with Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence between Monomer and Excimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives can be constructed by different substitution modes and connection patterns of [2,2]PCP cores and pyrene units. Diverse structures of these compounds lead to distinctive optical properties.







Abstract
We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2,2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2,2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colours and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylene diimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.

         <title>Carbon Dots based Tissue Equivalent Dosimeter as an Ionizing Radiation Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study describes the synthesis and characterization of carbon dots. These nanomaterials can be used as fluorescent sensors. Introduced in the Fricke solution, they detect ionizing radiation by oxidizing Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions. It has high sensitivity to gamma radiation, useful as a tissue&#8208;equivalent dosimeter. Tested as radiation sensors, they showed two regions of linear response.







Abstract
This work explores the potential of carbon dots as a fluorescent probe in the determination of heavy ions and as an electrochemical biosensor. It also discusses how carbon dots can be introduced into the Fricke solution to potentially serve as an ionizing radiation sensor.

&lt;p&gt;The study describes the synthesis and characterization of carbon dots. These nanomaterials can be used as fluorescent sensors. Introduced in the Fricke solution, they detect ionizing radiation by oxidizing Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. It has high sensitivity to gamma radiation, useful as a tissue-equivalent dosimeter. Tested as radiation sensors, they showed two regions of linear response.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work aims to study the aza&#8208;Darzens reaction using water as a solvent in a nanoconfined environment. This study was carried out on four different gamma&#8208;cyclodextrin systems to evaluate the reaction yield and the cis/trans ratio of the aziridines obtained. In addition, the reaction mechanism was studied using molecular dynamics and the support of mass spectrometry and DOSY experiments.







Abstract
In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric &#947;&#8208;CD such as a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco&#8208;friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthesis and Application of Chiral Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral organoselenium compounds have been widely used in the fields of organic catalysis, medicine, and materials due to their unique structural characteristics and reactivities. In this review, the synthesis of chiral selenides in recent decades and their applications in catalysis, medicine, and materials are summarized.







Abstract
Chiral organoselenium compounds have shown an important role as intermediates in many areas, such as drug discovery, organic catalysis, and nanomaterials. A lot of different methods have been developed to synthesize chiral compounds which contain selenium, because they have interesting properties and can be used in real life. Over the last few decades, a lot of progress has been made in synthesizing chiral organoselenium compounds. This work gives an overview of the progress made in creating new ways to synthesize chiral organoselenium compounds by categorizing them into groups based on the reactions they undergo. In addition, the use of chiral organoselenium compounds is also discussed.

         <title>Organometallic Bridge Diversification of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>

Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20&#8197;hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Sulfones Using Bis&#8208;Piperidine Sulfur Dioxide &#8211; An Underutilized Reagent for SO2 Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot sulfone preparation is reported from alkyl bromides activated by silane&#8208;mediated halogen atom transfer. In the process, a previously unutilized SO2 adduct bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide &#8211; or PIPSO &#8211; was found to be the best source of SO2 for radical capture under the reaction conditions. Alkyl and aryl sulfones were prepared as well as sulfonylated APIs.







Abstract
Sulfonyl groups are widely observed in biologically relevant molecules and consequently, SO2 capture is an increasingly attractive method to prepare these sulfonyl&#8208;containing compounds given the range of SO2&#8208;surrogates now available as alternatives to using the neat gas. This, along with the advent of photoredox catalysis, has enabled mild radical capture of SO2 to emerge as an effective route to sulfonyl compounds. Here we report a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile sulfonylation of aryl and alkyl bromides making use of a previously under&#8208;used amine&#8208;SO2 surrogate; bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide (PIPSO). A broad selection of alkyl and aryl bromides were photocatalytically converted to their corresponding sulfinates and then trapped with various electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot multistep procedure to prepare sulfones and sulfonamides.

         <title>Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8211;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single&#8208;ion Cu(II) centers in the three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine&#8208;tuning ability.







Abstract
With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5&#8201;%, 2&#8201;%, 1&#8201;%, and 0.1&#8201;% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][ZnII(HCOO)3].

     alt="Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8211;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single-ion Cu(II) centers in the three-dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine-tuning ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5&#8201;%, 2&#8201;%, 1&#8201;%, and 0.1&#8201;% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite-type MOF [CH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;=2.07, &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;=2.12, and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;=2.44) in the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;) of 3.5&#8197;ms (5&#8201;% Cu), 9.2&#8197;ms (2&#8201;% Cu), and 15&#8197;ms (1&#8201;% Cu) at 1.8&#8197;K. Furthermore, pulse-ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin-spin relaxation (phase memory) time (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.21&#8197;&#956;s (2&#8201;%Cu), 0.39&#8197;&#956;s (1&#8201;%Cu), and 3.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.1&#8201;%Cu) at 10&#8197;K as well as Rabi oscillation between &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;=&#177;1/2 spin sublevels. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)-doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50&#8197;K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the magnetic dipole interactions relating with cross-relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Skeletal Editing of Indazoles by Donor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the prevalence of heterocyclic scaffolds in drug&#8208;related molecules, converting these highly modular heterocyclic scaffolds into structural diversified and dearomatized analogs is an ideal strategy for improving their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we describe an efficient method for silver carbene mediated dearomative N&#8211;N bond cleavage leading to skeletal hopping between indazole and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline via a highly selective single&#8208;carbon insertion procedure. Using this methodology, a series of dihydroquinazoline analogues with diarylmethylene&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon centers were constructed with excellent yields and good functional group compatibility, which was further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of important pharmaceutically active ingredients. DFT calculations indicated that the silver catalyst not only induces the formation of the silver carbene, but also activates the diazahexatriene intermediate, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the C&#8211;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Puffing with Large Volume Expansion and Photomechanical Motions induced by Topochemical [4+4] Reactions in Molecular Crystal Solvates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first example of two crystal solvates of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule (Ant) that display very distinct photo&#8208;responsive behaviour when 365 or 405 nm or visible light is illuminated. For the first time, the crystal hydrate that has water molecule in the lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;H2O) display fascinating puffing behavior with large volume expansion and surface modulation when illuminated with 405 nm light, a phenomenon very much similar to the rice or popcorn puffing by thermal treatment. Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant&#8208;H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions.The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;DMF) responds to 405 nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant&#8208;DMF crystal was also observed under ambient / white light but at a slower rate compared to 405 nm light. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>An Interface&#8208;cascading Silicon Photoanode with Strengthened Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Enriched Surface Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n&#8208;type Silicon (n&#8208;Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n&#8208;Si/CoOx, a NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96 V vs. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for OER, as compared to n&#8208;Si/CoOx, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/FeOOH and n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built&#8208;in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650 mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n&#8208;Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Central Ring Puckering Enhances the Stokes Shift of Xanthene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000 cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700 cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic topological and supramolecular control of Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity based on a tunable self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining two biorelevant concepts, i.&#8201;e., compartmentalization and regulator&#8208;induced conformational change allows control of the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity between a furan moiety and maleimide in water. Using a thermosensitive regulator enables the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to be turned off at elevated temperature, whereas it is activated by lowering the temperature, representing a rare example of reduced reactivity at elevated temperature.







Abstract
Compartmentalization and binding&#8208;triggered conformational change regulate many metabolic processes in living matter. Here, we have synergistically combined these two biorelevant processes to tune the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactivity of a synthetic self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu, consisting of an electron&#8208;rich furan unit covalently attached to the electron&#8208;deficient cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetrachloride (CBPQT4+, 4Cl&#8722;) host. This design allows CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu to efficiently compartmentalize the furan ring inside its host cavity in water, thereby protecting it from the DA reaction with maleimide. Remarkably, the self&#8208;complexed CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu can undergo a conformational change through intramolecular decomplexation upon the addition of a stronger binding molecular naphthalene derivative as a competitive guest, triggering the DA reaction upon addition of a chemical regulator. Remarkably, connecting the guest to a thermoresponsive lower critical solution temperature (LCST) copolymer regulator controls the DA reaction on command upon heating and cooling the reaction media beyond and below the cloud point temperature of the copolymer, representing a rare example of decreased reactivity upon increasing temperature. Altogether, this work opens up new avenues towards combined topological and supramolecular control over reactivity in synthetic constructs, enabling control over reactivity through molecular regulators or even mild temperature variations.

         <title>Gold&#8208;promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8 &#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se NMR), and LC&#8208;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8208;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8208;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8208;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8208;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8208;Se)&#8208;AVP), and the Bos taurus glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2 mM, pH = 7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox&#8208;based mechanism where the C&#8208;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis with Organoselenium Compounds &#8211; The Past Twelve Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries and, especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Interlocked and Non&#8208;Interlocked Deca(para&#8208;phenylene) Derivatives by Ni&#8208;mediated Biaryl Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a compound composed of directly connected 1,4&#8208;phenylene moieties. The synthesis of PPn composed of six or more phenylene moieties with no substituent at the internal phenylene moiety has been challenging because of its low solubility. Herein we synthesized oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes, including a deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane, with a defined number of phenylene moieties. Biaryl coupling of iodoarenes mediated by macrocyclic dibenzodihydrophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex was utilized for the first time to synthesize the [2]rotaxanes. Compared to the non&#8208;interlocked deca(para&#8208;phenylene), the deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane showed higher solubility. The properties of the oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes and non&#8208;interlocked oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)s were analyzed by spectroscopic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, reacts selectively with Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. This is a rare phenomenon in which a tripeptide forms a metallohydrogel without any protective group. HIT is transformed from a random coil&#8208;like structure to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure by the Cu2+ ions, thereby forming a hydrogel.







Abstract
Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.

We discovered that &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-His-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ile-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random-coil-like to a &#946;-sheet-like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Hindered, Regioselective Access to Multifunctional Groups Diarylamines via SNAr Substitution of P&#8208;Nitroso Aromatic Methyl Ether by Arylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional groups diarylamines efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. Relying on the catalysis of hydrogen protons, the SNAr reaction, which is endowed with resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso groups, and high regioselectivity, can be carried out under mild conditions, even if the substrates involved do not have strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups.







Abstract
Multifunctional groups diarylamines, an innovative product, efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. This SNAr proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and more significantly, the substrates involved do not necessarily require strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Moreover, this SNAr is characterized by resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso functional groups, and high regioselectivity. Mechanistic observations suggest that the SNAr is the result of the transfer of the positive charge center of the protonated nitroso group to the p&#8208;methoxy group.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign supporting electrolyte&#8208;free oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazole has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical indazolylindazolones via electrochemical reduction of aerial oxygen. Simultaneously, unsymmetrical coupling products were efficiently produced by cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between indazolone and 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives through electrochemical C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). This exogenous metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free protocol delivered a number of multi&#8208;functionalized products with high tolerance of diverse functional groups.

         <title>Tuning the Topology of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks through Site&#8208;Selective Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8208;Ah) and 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8208;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261 mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560 mg/g) compared to the nonfunctionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8208;Tz COF (123 mg/g for CV and 1340 mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on DNA targeting Re/Tc complexes and their biomedical relevance, highlighting different types of homometallic and heterobimetallic complexes and different modes of DNA interactions. Future directions and contribution of DNA&#8208;targeted Re/Tc complexes for the development and success of anticancer agents and cancer theranostic radiopharmaceuticals are discussed.







Abstract
Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M=Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in&#8197;vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.

Four twisted D&#8208;A TADF molecules based on diindolocarbazole and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor were synthesized, characterized and utilized for photocatalytic E&#8722;Z isomerization of stilbene and C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26&#8197;eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4&#8197;ns to 31&#8197;ns) and longer delayed components (36.4&#8197;ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80&#8201;%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.

         <title>Template Assisted Formation of 32&#8201;and 34&#960; Octaphyrins Embedded with Dithienopyrrole Cores: A New Scaffold to Unravel Proton Coupled Redox Switching and (Anti)Aromaticity</title>

The fourfold meso&#8208;substituted 32&#960; antiaromatic octaphyrin 1 embedded with dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole undergoes facile proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to its 34&#960; aromatic congener H21&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H+. Such a conversion was effective even in the presence of weak acids as well as small organic molecules like alcohols and amines. The stable aromatic freebase H21 exhibits near&#8208;planar conformation with colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions.







Abstract
Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin is 32&#960; antiaromatic and undergoes proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34&#960; aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and F&#8722;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH&#8208;dependent bioimaging.

Actuate Acyl Azolium and Acetone with violet Aurora!! The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced methodology is highly desirable to access thermodynamically less favoured (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. We demonstrate that acetone acts as a reactant as well as a solvent, acyl azolium salt acts as an aroyl surrogate, and the triplet state of acyl azolium promotes intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone under violet LED irradiation. This mild and environmentally friendly protocol does not require any metals, ligands, or oxidants.







Abstract
Mono &#945;&#8208;acylation of acetone has been achieved for the first time by reacting with bench&#8208;stable acyl azolium salts under violet&#8208;LED light at room temperature. The intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone to triplet state of azolium salts under violet LED irradiation resulted in thermodynamically less favourable (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 selectivity via C&#8722;C bond formation. This compelling protocol access the desired &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation product under metal&#8208;, ligand&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions on a wide range of substrates.

Heavy group 14&#8208;15&#8201;compounds: Various low&#8208;valent group 14&#8211;15 compounds of the type [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (M=Ge&#8722;Pb, E=As&#8722;Bi) were obtained by salt elimination reactions. The focus of these investigations is on the heavy representatives of both groups, on the structures and the reactivity.







Abstract
A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8211;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M=Ge&#8208;Pb) (I&#8211;III) (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2) and M'E(SiMe3)2 (M&#8217;=Li, E=As; M&#8217;=K, E=Sb, Bi) (IV&#8211;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8722;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M=Ge, 2E: M=Sn, 3E: M=Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8722;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8722;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8722;Se&#8722;As chain.

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bond.

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8210;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8210;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of the &#160;fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8210;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) generated from the C&#8210;C bond insertion reaction is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. These findings reveal the first example of a double C&#8211;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy transfer on cytoskeleton of red blood cell ghosts and&#160;their efficiency control by KCl concentration&#8208;induced cell shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as reactors to construct bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer reaction utilizing red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), which have asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability, as reactors. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Role of BN&#8208;Embedding Position in B2N2&#8208;Perylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2&#8208;perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2&#8208;perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane. It is further clarified that BN position dominates the photophysical properties over BN orientation. The revealed guideline here may apply generally to novel BN&#8208;PAHs, and aid the advancement of BN&#8208;PAHs with highly&#8208;emissive performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Look at the Mechanism of Cocrystal Formation and Coformers Exchange in Processes Forced by Mechanical and/or Thermal Stimuli &#8211; ex situ and in&#8197;situ Studies of Low&#8208;Melting Eutectic Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first attempt to explain in&#8197;situ with atomic resolution the multi&#8208;stage mechanism of cocrystals formation in various devices used for their preparation (ball mills, hot stage melting, MAS rotors).







Abstract
Three different devices: ball mill, hot stage melting, and magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotor were used for the preparation of ethenzamide (ET) cocrystals with glutaric acid (GLU), ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and maleic acid (MAL) as coformers. In each case, well&#8208;defined binary systems (ET:EMA, ET:GLU, ET:MAL) were obtained. The common features of the two solvent free methods of cocrystal formation (grinding, melting) are presented on the basis of arguments obtained by solid state NMR spectroscopy. Thermal analysis (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) proved that the eutectic phase arises over a wide range of molar ratios of components for each of the binary systems. NMR techniques, supported by theoretical calculations, allowed to provide details about the pathway of the reaction mechanism with atomic accuracy. It was found that the formation of ET cocrystals is a complex process that requires five steps. Each step has been recognized and described. Variable temperature 1D and 2D MAS NMR experiments allowed to track physicochemical processes taking place in a molten state. Moreover, it was found that in a multicomponent mixture consisting of all four components, ET, EMA, GLU, and MAL, ET in the molten phase behaves as a specific selector choosing only one partner to form binary cocrystals according to energy preferences. The process of exchange of coformers in binary systems during grinding, melting, and NMR measurements is described. The stabilization energies (Estab) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps computed for the cocrystals under discussion and their individual components rationalize the selection rules and explain the relationships between individual species.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) is a promising electrode material, which has the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability.

Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high-performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal-ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs-based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high-performance alkali metal-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we primarily summarized the hybridizations between four classical fluorophores, namely xanthene, cyanine, coumarin and BODIPY. We provided an overview of the connection modes between conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated hybrid fluorophores. Hybrid fluorophores have played an irreplaceable role in the fields of biological detection, diagnosis and treatment.







Abstract
Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.

         <title>On Demand Synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; Bisindoles by a Formal Umpolung Strategy: First Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Rivularin A</title>

On Demand Synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; Bisindoles!!: Unified synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines, indole/indolines, and bisindoles was accomplished by a formal umpolung strategy. Good functional group tolerance enabled the first total synthesis of polybrominated C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindole alkaloid rivularin A.







Abstract
In this work, a straightforward synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines is achieved by a formal umpolung strategy. The protocols were tolerant of a wide variety of substituents on the indole and indoline ring. In addition, the C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines could be converted to C3&#8722;N1&#8217; indole&#8208;indolines and C3&#8722;N1&#8217;&#8208;bisindoles. Also, we have successfully synthesized (&#177;)&#8208;rivularin A through a biomimetic late&#8208;stage tribromination as a key step.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light driven control over oligomerization of triple and quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded ditopic self&#8208;assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8208;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Reactivities of tert&#8208;Butyllithium by the Addition of Stoichiometric Amounts of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In alkyllithium chemistry the highest reactivity has historically been linked to the smallest degree of aggregation possible. Since tert&#8208;butyllithium is known to form a monomer in tetrahydrofuran solution, using just stoichiometric amounts of the lewis base to selectively form a dimeric species seemed irrational. In this study, we showed a considerable increase of the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi when using stoichiometric amounts of THF in the non&#8208;polar solvent n&#8208;pentane in order to enable the deprotonation of simple methyl silanes and other low C&#8211;H&#8208;acidic substrates. In this context, we were able to obtain the corresponding aggregates of t&#8208;BuLi with the ligand THF in suspension and as crystalline solids and investigate them by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, in situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, we were able to explain the enhanced reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi with stoichiometric amounts of THF on the basis of structural features of the bridged dimer obtained under these conditions. With these findings, we present a new target in the aggregation of alkyllithium reagents: the selectively formed &#8220;frustrated&#8221; aggregates!</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their higher specific capacity. However, the actual capacity falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the inevitable dendritic growth and side reactions on the surface of Zn anode. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective method to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity to achieve the goal of low N/P batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interactions Enhanced Colorimetric Sensors for Both Acid and Base Vapor Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;based COFs with spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures are successfully synthesized and exhibit simultaneous sensing ability towards both acidic and alkaline vapors.







Abstract
Due to the high surface area and uniform porosity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), they exhibit superior properties in capturing and detecting even trace amounts of gases in the air. However, the COFs materials that possess dual detected functionality are still less reported.

     alt="Donor-Acceptor Interactions Enhanced Colorimetric Sensors for Both Acid and Base Vapor Based on Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imine-based COFs with spatial-distribution-defined D-A structures are successfully synthesized and exhibit simultaneous sensing ability towards both acidic and alkaline vapors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the high surface area and uniform porosity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), they exhibit superior properties in capturing and detecting even trace amounts of gases in the air. However, the COFs materials that possess dual detected functionality are still less reported. Here, an imine-based COF containing thiophene as a donor and triazine as an acceptor to form spatial-distribution-defined D-A structures was prepared. D-A system between thiophene and triazine facilitates the charge transfer process during the protonation process of the imine and the triazine units. The obtained COF exhibits simultaneous sensing ability toward both acidic and alkaline vapors with obvious colorimetric sensing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Modular Reactivity of Low Valent Al/Zn Heterobimetallics Supported by Common Monodentate Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances on low valent main group metal chemistry have shown the excellent potential of heterobimetallic complexes derived from Al(I) to promote cooperative small molecule activation processes. A signature feature of these complexes is the use of bulky chelating ligands which act as spectators providing kinetic stabilization to their highly reactive Al&#8208;M bonds. Breaking new ground in this field, here we report the synthesis of novel unsupported Al/Zn bimetallics prepared by the selective formal insertion of AlCp* into the Zn&#8208;N bond of the utility zinc amides ZnR2&#160;(R = HMDS, hexamethyldisilazide; or TMP, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide). By systematically assessing the reactivity of the new [(R)(Cp*)AlZn(R)] bimetallics towards carbodiimides, structural and mechanistic insights have been gained on their ability to undergo insertion in their Zn&#8208;Al bond. Disclosing a dramatic ligand effect, when R = TMP, an isomerization process can be induced giving [(TMP)2AlZn(Cp*)] which displays a special reactivity towards carbodiimides and carbon dioxide involving both its Al&#8208;N bonds, leaving its Al&#8208;Zn bond untouched.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ construction of poly(tetraisopentyl acrylate) based gel polymer electrolytes with LixLa2&#8208;xTiO3 for high energy density lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1, and a high lithium transfer number of 0.85 at 30 &#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550 h at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84% after 500 cycles at 2C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4 mAh/g. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An unclassical structure of {Ru(C6H6)}&#8208;based polyoxometalate, Cs6H4[Te2Mo12O46{Ru(C6H6)}]&#183;16.5H2O (1), has been successfully constructed from {Te2Mo12O46}&#8208;type heteropolymolybdate and {Ru(C6H6)} group, which structure type was discovered for the first time. Compound 1 not only possesses strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield = 94%; turnover number = 500; turnover frequency = 20.8 h&#8208;1). Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement and energy level matching analysis provide theoretical basis for the derivation of the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups are of utmost importance in biologically active compounds, but methods to tether these motifs to organic architectures have been limited. Typically, the preparation of these compounds relied on the use of strong bases or multistep routes. The renaissance of radical chemistry in photocatalytic, transition metal mediated, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have allowed the installation of these medicinally relevant fluorinated motifs. This review provides an overview of the methods available for the direct synthesis of hydroxytrifluoroethyl&#8208; and trifluoroacetyl&#8208;derived compounds governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Neptunium Oxidation to the Heptavalent State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neptunium can exist in multiple oxidation states, including the rare and poorly understood heptavalent form.&#160;&#160; In this work, we monitored the formation of heptavalent neptunium [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8208; during ozonolysis of aqueous MOH (M = Li, Na, K) solutions using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All experimental reactions were closely monitored via absorption and vibrational spectroscopy to follow both the oxidation state and the speciation of neptunium guided by the calculated vibrational frequencies for various neptunium species. The mechanism of the reaction partly involves oxidative dissolution of transient Np(VI) oxide/hydroxide solid phases, the identity of which are dependent on the co&#8208;precipitating counter&#8208;cation Li+/Na+/K+. Additional calculations suggest that the most favorable energetic pathway occurs through the reaction of a [Np(V)O2(OH)4]3&#8208; with the hydroxide radical to form [Np(VI)O2(OH)4]2&#8208;, followed by an additional oxidation with HO&#9679; to create [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy induced by Pt&#8208;coordination of type&#8208;II photosensitizers into supramolecular complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt&#8208;coordination&#8208;based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py)2Pt(OTf)2. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type&#8208;I ROS generation (O2&#8226;&#8208;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;EST resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type&#8208;I ROS (O2&#8226;&#8208;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. In vitro evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py)2Pt(OTf)2 nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type&#8208;I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>A Torquoselective Thermal 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Approach to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes via Solvent&#8208;Aided Proton Transfer: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of hexatriene typically delivers 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,3&#8208;CHD). However, there is only limited success in directly synthesizing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) using such an approach, probably due to the difficulty in realizing thermally&#8208;forbidden 1,3&#8208;hydride shift after electrocyclic ring closure. The present study shows that by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes bearing ester or ketone substituents at the C1&#8208;position in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2:1) solvents at 90&#8208;100 &#176;C, 1,4&#8208;CHDs can be selectively synthesized. This is achieved through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a proton&#8208;transfer process. The success of this method depends on the polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted intramolecular proton transfer from 1,3&#8208;CHD to 1,4&#8208;CHD, which has been confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. There are no reports to date for such a solvent&#8208;assisted isomerization. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have suggested that forming 1,3&#8208;CHD and subsequent isomerization is a thermodynamically feasible process, regardless of the functional groups involved. Two possible successive polar solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer pathways have been identified for isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#9472;N bonds is a major challenge, and methods that allow C&#9472;N atroposelective bond formation are rare. This is a problem because each atropoisomer can feature starkly differentiated biological properties. Yet, among the three most practical and applicable classical amination methods available: 1) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction, 2) the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig reaction, and 3) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction, none has truly been rendered atroposelective at the newly formed C&#9472;N bond. The first ever Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam atroposelective amination is herein described with a simple copper catalyst and newly designed PyrOx chiral ligand. This method should find important applications in asymmetric synthesis, in particular for medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ervaoffine J and K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Herein, we describe the total synthesis of ervaoffine J &amp; K from a central intermediate. Ervaoffine J was synthesized in eight steps in 14% yield. Our strategy features an aerobic Winterfeldt oxidation to introduce the 4&#8208;quinolone moeity. Ervaoffine K was produced in ten steps and 10% yield. The synthesis leveraged (bromodifluoromethyl)&#8208;trimethylsilane&#160;to induce a regioselective von Braun&#8208;type C&#8208;N bond fragmentation. This C&#8208;N bond cleavage unveiled the tetrasubstituted all&#8208;syn&#160;cyclohexane core of ervaoffine K and enabled the completion of its synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Orientation of Liquid Crystals Inside Micropores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Having Thermoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of controlling the orientation of liquid crystals (LCs) toward realizing external stimuli&#8211;responsive materials with tunable functionalities, we synthesized a composite of LCs and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by filling LCs into the pores of MOFs (LC@MOFs) for the first time. The included LCs interact with the MOFs through coordination bonds between the cyano groups of the LCs and the metal ions of the MOFs, enabling the orientation of the LC molecules inside the pores of the MOFs and the realization of birefringence of LC@MOFs. The three&#8208;dimensional nanometer interstice frameworks maintained the LC orientation even at temperatures much higher than the isotropic phase transition temperature of bulk LCs. Furthermore, the orientational state changed upon heating or cooling, inducing temperature&#8208;dependent birefringence. This study provides a new approach to the development of stimuli&#8211;responsive optical materials and stimuli&#8211;responsive MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Designable and Stabilized Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a class of crystalline framework materials assembled by hydrogen bonds. HOFs have the advantages of high crystallinity, mild reaction conditions, good solution processability, and reproducibility. Coupled with the reversibility and flexibility of hydrogen bonds, HOFs can be assembled into a wide diversity of crystalline structures. Since the bonding energy of hydrogen bonds is lower than that of ligand and covalent bonds, the framework of HOFs is prone to collapse after desolventisation and the stability is not high, which limits the development and application of HOFs. In recent years, numerous stable and functional HOFs have been developed by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, highly interpenetrated networks, charge&#8208;assisted, ligand&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted, molecular weaving, and covalent cross&#8208;linking. Charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs introduce electrostatic attraction into HOFs to improve stability while enriching structural diversity and functionality. In this paper, we review the development, the principles of rational design and assembly of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs, introduces the different building block construction modes of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs. Highlight the applications of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, biological applications, etc., and prospects for the diverse design of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs structures and multifunctional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Asymmetric Allylic C&#8208;H Alkylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Hydroquinone Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8208;H alkylation under aerobic conditions. The ternary synergistic catalysis enables a facile allylic C&#8208;H activation and alkylation with oxygen so that stoichiometric utilization of benzoquinone can be avoided. The identified optimal catalytic system allows for terminal addition to allyl arenes with &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls to afford allylic adducts bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work provides new insights for further studies on the aerobically oxidative C&#8208;H alkylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Covalent&#8208;Disassembly&#8221;&#8208;Based Approaches For Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of analytes with small molecular probes is crucial for the analysis and understanding of chemical, medicinal, environmental and biological situations as well as processes. Classic detection approaches rely on the concept of molecular recognition and bond formation reactions. Bond breakage reactions have been less explored in similar contexts. This concept article introduces metal&#8208;salen and metal&#8208;imine complexes as &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221;&#8208;based (DB)&#8208;probes for detecting polyoxophosphates, thiols, amino acids, HCN and changes in pH. It discusses the roles, importance and combinations of structurally functionalized molecular building blocks in the construction of DB&#8208;probes. Applications of optimized DB&#8208;probes for analyte detection in live cells and foodstuff are also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanism of the disassembly of a Fe(III)&#8208;salen probe upon pyrophosphate binding is presented. Extraordinary selectivity for this analyte was achieved by a multistep disassembly sequence including an unprecedented structural change of the metal complex (i.e. &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; principle). Design principles of probes for sensing applications following the &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221; approach are summarized, which will help improving current systems, but will also facilitate the development of new DB&#8208;probes for challenging analytic targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Preferences at the Glycosidic Linkage of Saccharides in Solution as Deduced from NMR Experiments and MD Simulations: Comparison to Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans are central to information content and regulation in biological systems. These carbohydrate molecules are active either as oligo&#8208; or polysaccharides, often as glycoconjugates. The conformational preferences and population distributions at the glycosidic torsion angles &#981; and &#968; have been investigated for O&#8208;methyl glycosides of three disaccharides where the substitution takes place at a secondary alcohol. Stereochemical differences at or adjacent to the glycosidic linkage were explored by solution state NMR spectroscopy using one&#8208;dimensional 1H,1H&#8208;NOESY NMR experiments to obtain transglycosidic proton&#8208;proton distances and one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to obtain 3JCH transglycosidic coupling constants related to torsion angles &#981; and &#968;. Computed effective proton&#8208;proton distances from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed excellent agreement to experimentally derived distances for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides and revealed that for the bimodal distribution at the &#968; torsion angle for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide experiment and simulation were at variance with each other, calling for further force field developments. The MD simulations disclosed a highly intricate inter&#8208;residue hydrogen bonding pattern for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide, including a nonconventional hydrogen bond between H5' in the glucosyl residue and O3 in the galactosyl residue, supported by a large downfield 1H NMR chemical shift displacement compared to &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Afterglow from Benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic Acid&#8208;doped Co&#8208;crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate thermosensing requires a minimum impact of autofluorescence and light scattering from the samples. In this study, we discovered that benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA) doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) exhibit excellent thermochromic dual phosphorescence properties over a wide temperature range from &#8210;132 to 40&#176;C, despite its simple structure that does not have any donor&#8208;acceptor linkage. The dual phosphorescence was consisted of monomeric benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronate (BDBA ester) and aggregation&#8208;stabilized species. With an increase in temperature, the emission intensity from the monomeric state significantly decreased, whereas that originating from the aggregated state remained almost constant owing to the difference in their thermal stabilities. Further investigation revealed that molecular distortions in singlet excited states enable efficient intersystem crossing, causing efficient phosphorescence from the monomeric state of BDBA ester.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well-defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano-Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum-oxide-supported nano-Ni3C (nano-Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano-Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram-scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano-Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano-Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid-phase organic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>

         <dc:description>The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes places, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed&#8208;valent nature of CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed&#8208;valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in&#8208;situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core. DFT results show that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as Promising Cathode for Advanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthraquinone electrode materials are promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance,&#160;high theoretical capacity, and good reversibility of&#160; anthraquinone electrodes. However, the active anthraquinone materials are soluble in organic electrolytes, resulting in a sharp decay of capacity during the charge and discharge processes. Herein, we report on a two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOF) fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method. The 2D CaAQDC MOF not only effectively inhibits the dissolution of active electrode substances into the electrolyte, but also promotes the diffusion of lithium ions into the pores of the MOF. When used as a cathode for the LIBs, the resulting CaAQDC electrode delivers a high specific capacity of ~100 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at a current density of 50 mA&#183;g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle stability. Even at a high current density of 200 mA&#183;g&#8208;1, the CaAQDC electrode exhibits a specific capacity of ~60 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1. The fabricated 2D coordination polymers effectively restrains the dissolution of anthraquinone into the organic electrolyte and enhances the structural stability, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of anthraquinone. These research results offer a rational molecular design strategy to address the dissolution of this and other active organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;dependent Electrochemical Performance of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCoO3 perovskite for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new electrode materials with good temperature&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance has become a great issue for the deployment of hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.&#160;&#160;In this work, a series of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) perovskites have been studied as positive electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors in&#160;terms of their structures, elemental valence states and electrochemical performances. Incorporating Ta into SrCoO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite not only stabilizes the crystallite structure but also notably improves electrochemical activities. The SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC delivers the highest specific capacity (Qsp) of 227.91 C g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is attributed to the highest oxygen vacancy content and the fastest oxygen diffusion kinetics. The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high energy density of 22.82 Wh kg&#8208;1@775.09 W kg&#8208;1 and a stable long&#8208;term cycle life (5000 cycles) with 90.7% capacity retention. As temperature increases from 25 to 85 &#8451;, the capacitance properties are improved at elevated temperatures for both electrode and device due to the increased electrolyte conductivity. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.</dc:description>
