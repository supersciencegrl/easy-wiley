      <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  , with late first raw transition metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2  and CoCl2  afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M = Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintains an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0 &#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380 K, the cobalt complex presents a gradual spin crossover behavior (the magnetic moment varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves  S1/2  (predominant at  T&lt;180 K) and  S3/2  (predominant at&#160;  T  &gt; 200 K). Both cobalt(II) species have been detected by EPR at  T&lt;20 K). The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme = dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2  involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPi  Pr2)2CMe2}2  ], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl  2  led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  }].</dc:description>

      <title>Nonclassical Abramov Products Formed on Orifices of Cage&#8208;Opened C60 Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The nucleophilic addition of phosphites to a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative gave &#945;&#8208;hydrophosphates and enol phosphates as kinetic and thermodynamic products, respectively. Different from classical Abramov reactions, which give phosphonates bearing a P&#8722;C bond, these products possess a P&#8722;O bond. Theoretical calculations suggested that the charge delocalization of zwitterionic intermediates along with the &#960;&#8208;framework facilitate the phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement, thus forming nonclassical Abramov products.

      <title>Single point mutant inverts stereoselectivity of a carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with enhanced activity</title>
      <dc:description>Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of anti&#8208;Prelog carbonyl reductase toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, the rational design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to anti&#8208;Prelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1%&#8208;99.1% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (  k  cat  /  K  m  ) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation.

      <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole Diradical</title>
      <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene&#8208;susbtituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole diradical  ICz&#8208;CN.This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz&#8208;CN)2  containing two long C(sp3 )&#8208;C(sp  3) &#963;&#8208;bonds between the dicyanomethylene units . The minor open&#8208;shell ICz&#8208;CN component in the solid state mixture was identify with EPR spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetric and UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemical data, and comparison with reference monomer  ICz&#8208;Br  reveal that the nature of the one&#8208;electron oxidation of (ICz&#8208;CN)2  at ambient temperature and  ICz&#8208;CN  at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the  ICz  backbone. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close&#8208;lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz&#8208;CN)  2  and especially  ICz&#8208;CN  compared to  ICz&#8208;Br  , resulting in the distinctive cathodic behaviour at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral  ICz&#8208;CN  , its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable at ambient conditions. The UV&#8208;Vis(&#8208;NIR) electronic transitions in parent (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  and  ICz&#8208;CN  and their different redox forms have been assigned with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The s&#8208;bond cleavage in neutral (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  is achieved in solution and in the solid&#8208;state upon soft external stimuli (time, temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue&#8210;green.

      <title>Fluorides of silver under large compression</title>
      <dc:description>The silver&#8208;fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag  +  and Ag  2+  cations (Ag  3  F  4  and Ag  2  F  3  ) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors at ambient pressure conditions. For Ag  2  F  5  , containing both Ag  2+  and Ag  3+  , we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure&#8208;induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF  4  as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed valence compounds of silver at high pressure.</dc:description>

      <title>Separation of xylene isomers in the anion&#8208;pillared square grid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8209;Cu</title>
      <dc:description>Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating m&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &gt; m&#8208;xylene &gt; p&#8208;xylene.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Development of Guanidinate and Amidinate Based Cerium and Ytterbium Complexes as Atomic Layer Deposition Precursors: Synthesis, Modeling, and Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Systematic engineering of Ce and Yb based amidinate and guanidinate complexes resulted in precursors suitable for atomic layer deposition (ALD) applications. Computational modeling reveals the reactivity of the complexes towards water and oxygen. A water assisted ALD process for the growth of CeO2 thin films was demonstrated with the Ce tris&#8208;guanidinate precursor.







Abstract
Owing to the limited availability of suitable precursors for vapor phase deposition of rare&#8208;earth containing thin&#8208;film materials, new or improved precursors are sought after. In this study, we explored new precursors for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) containing thin films. A series of homoleptic tris&#8208;guanidinate and tris&#8208;amidinate complexes of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The C&#8208;substituents on the N&#8208;C&#8208;N backbone (Me, NMe2, NEt2, where Me=methyl, Et=ethyl) and the N&#8208;substituents from symmetrical iso&#8208;propyl (iPr) to asymmetrical tertiary&#8208;butyl (tBu) and Et were systematically varied to study the influence of the substituents on the physicochemical properties of the resulting compounds. Single crystal structures of [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 and [Yb(dpdmg)3] 6 (dpdmg=N,N'&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate) highlight a monomeric nature in the solid&#8208;state with a distorted trigonal prismatic geometry. The thermogravimetric analysis shows that the complexes are volatile and emphasize that increasing asymmetry in the complexes lowers their melting points while reducing their thermal stability. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the reactivity of amidinates and guanidinates of Ce and Yb complexes towards oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Signified by the DFT calculations, the guanidinates show an increased reactivity toward water compared to the amidinate complexes. Furthermore, the Ce complexes are more reactive compared to the Yb complexes, indicating even a reactivity towards oxygen potentially exploitable for ALD purposes. As a representative precursor, the highly reactive [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 was used for proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle ALD depositions of CeO2 thin films using water as co&#8208;reactant. The self&#8208;limited ALD growth process could be confirmed at 160&#8201;&#176;C with polycrystalline cubic CeO2 films formed on Si(100) substrates. This study confirms that moving towards nitrogen&#8208;coordinated rare&#8208;earth complexes bearing the guanidinate and amidinate ligands can indeed be very appealing in terms of new precursors for ALD of rare earth based materials.

      <title>Synthesis and biological activity of ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide &#8211; discovery of a novel dual inhibitor of topoisomerase II activity and tubulin polymerization</title>

Chromium(III)&#8208;based Metallacrowns complete this class of compounds important in molecular recognition, catalysis, and magneto chemistry. While metallacrowns are usually built via self&#8208;assembly reactions, the solvothermal reaction paves the way for new kinetically and thermodynamically stable metallacrowns.

      <title>Specific Ion&#8208;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
      <dc:description>Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0 &#730;C, and thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly&#8208;specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation, whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria is strongly dependent upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8208;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.</dc:description>

A new borylstannane was invented to achieve the radical borylation of various alkyl radical precursors. Various alkyl radical precursors including isocyanides, selenides, sulfides, and alcohol or carboxylic acid derivatives are found to be applicable to the present borylation. The cover picture of a trapeze performer (borylstannane) grasping the arms of a clown (a radical) depicts the transition state of the radical borylation. The arms of the performer show a vacant p&#8208;orbital on the boron atom of the borylstannane, which intends to capture the clown's arms (radical), and the fallen hat depicts a stannyl radical.

      <title>Approaches to the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Modified Carbohydrates and Derivatives: thiosugars, iminosugars, and tetrahydro(thio)pyrans</title>
      <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In the light of these promising properties, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl R  F  groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they became relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of R  F  groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8208;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In the light of these promising properties, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl R  F  groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they became relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of R  F  groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8208;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>MODs vs NPs: vying for the future of printed electronics.</title>
      <dc:description>This Minireview compares two distinct ink types, namely metal&#8208;organic decomposition (MOD) or nanoparticle (NP) formulations, for use in the printing of some of the most conductive elements: silver, copper and aluminium. Printing of highly conductive features has found purpose across a broad array of electronics and as processing times and temperatures reduce, the avenues of application expand to low&#8208;cost flexible substrates, materials for wearable devices and beyond.

Since the turn of the century, the rise in MOD inks has vastly extended the range of potentially applicable compounds that can be printed, whilst simultaneously addressing shelf life and sintering issues. A brief introduction to the field and requirements of an ink will be presented followed by a detailed discussion of a wide array of synthetic routes to both MOD and NP inks. Unindustrialized materials will be discussed, with the challenges and outlook considered for the market leaders: silver and copper, in comparison with the emerging field of aluminium inks.</dc:description>

      <title>Bifunctional Hydrogen Bond Donor&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions: Origin of Stereoselectivity and Rate Enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>
(Thio)ureas have found numerous applications as organocatalysts, yet their mode of action, that is, the mechanism by which they accelerate reactions is still not fully understood. In this work, quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal that these bifunctional hydrogen bond organocatalysts accelerate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and acrolein by reducing the two&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (steric) Pauli repulsion between the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the reactants and not by enhancing the donor&#8211;acceptor orbital interactions, as is traditionally considered.

      <title>Cationic zinc hydrides catalyzed CO2 reduction to formate: Deciphering elementary reactions, isolation of intermediates and computational investigations</title>
      <dc:description>Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc centre and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences CO  2  reduction. We have investigated these factors by exploring elementary reactions of CO  2  hydrosilylation and hydroboration using cationic zinc hydrides bearing the tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and the tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc centre and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences CO  2  reduction. We have investigated these factors by exploring elementary reactions of CO  2  hydrosilylation and hydroboration using cationic zinc hydrides bearing the tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and the tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Synthetic Strategy for Cofacial Porphyrin&#8208;Based Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple route to dimeric complexes: Three different types of covalently linked metalloporphyrin dimers were synthesized. The monomers were synthesized sequentially and can be filled with metals before linking. As a result, different heterobimetallic systems can be made. Depending on the metals M1 and M2 used (M=Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd), a wide range of potentially catalytically active species can be prepared, such as analogues of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.







Abstract
We present a straightforward and generally applicable synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin complexes. The protocol allows the synthesis of unsymmetrical aryl&#8208;based meso&#8208;meso as well as &#946;&#8208;meso&#8208;linked porphyrins. Our method significantly increases the overall yield for the published compound known as o&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bisporphyrin (OBBP) by a factor of 6.8. Besides the synthesis of 16 novel homobimetallic complexes containing MnIII, FeIII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, and PdII, we achieved the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of an unsymmetrical cofacial benzene&#8208;linked porphyrin dimer containing both planar&#8208;chiral enantiomers of a NiII2 complex. Additionally, this new methodology allows access to heterobimetallic complexes such as the FeIII&#8208;NiII containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase active site analogue. The isolated species were investigated by various techniques, including ion mobility spectrometry, DFT calculations, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This allowed us to probe the influence of interplane distance on Soret band splitting.

      <dc:description>Catalytic carbene&#8208;transfer reactions constitute a class of highly useful transformations in organic synthesis. Although catalysts based on a range of transition&#8208;metals have been reported, the readily accessible nickel(II)&#8208;based complexes have been rarely used. Herein, an air&#8208;stable nickel(II)&#8208;carborane complex is reported as a well&#8208;defined, versatile and recyclable catalyst for selective carbene transfer reactions with low catalyst loading under mild conditions. This catalyst is effective for several types of reactions including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation, selective X&#8722;H insertions (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates. This represents a rare example of carborane ligands in base metal catalysis.</dc:description>

This catalyst is effective for several types of reactions including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation, selective X&#8722;H insertions (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates. This represents a rare example of carborane ligands in base metal catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A comparative study on the photophysical properties of anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins</title>
      <dc:description>Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins are flavonoids that are present in various food products (e.g. fruit, vegetables, wine, etc.). The large chemical diversity amongst these molecules leads to compound specific properties such as color and stability towards external conditions. These properties are also attractive for food and non&#8208;food applications. The photophysical experimental characterization is not easy as this generally demands advanced analytical techniques along with optimized separation procedures. Molecular modeling can provide insights into the fundamental understanding of the photophysical properties of these compounds in a uniform way for a broad set of compounds. However, the current literature is quite fragmented on this topic. Herein, a large set of 140 naturally derived anthocyanins was evaluated in a systematic way with three functionals (B3LYP, PBE0 and CAM&#8208;B3LYP). The accuracy of these functionals was determined with experimental literature &#955;  max,vis  &#8208;values. Next to &#955;  max,vis  &#8208;values, TD&#8208;DFT calculations also provided oscillator strengths, molar absorption coefficients and orbital energies, which define whether specific natural anthocyanin&#8208;based compounds can be deployed in food and non&#8208;food applications such as food additives/colorants, textile dyeing, analytical standards and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Thiocarbonylation as a Direct Route to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Carboxamides</title>
      <dc:description>A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min. were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted&#160; to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We report on the immobilization of cobalt catalysts on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi&#8209;homogeneous catalysts towards an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles,  via  the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins we achieved a 22.6&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC&#8208;NBD back&#8209;conversion&#160;with an initial TOF of up to 3.64 s  &#8208;1  and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, we prepared a series of novel &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; functionalized norbornadiene derivatives that feature excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366&#160;nm, quantum yields around 70&#160;%, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.4&#160;kJ/mol and outstanding thermal stability with T  1/2  &#160;(25&#160;&#176;C) over 100 days.

Their structural and physical properties have been compared with the also newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu] and [GdYb], respectively) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between Eu(III) and Yb(III) does not occur to a significant extent, while emission from Yb(III) originates via sensitization from the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two Nd(III) centers in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], where Yb(III) luminescence is thus in part sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces on nickel&#8208;copper double hydroxide nanotyres to pre&#8208;activate alkaline ammonia oxidation reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>The surface hydroxyls of NixCu1&#8208;x(OH)2  play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8208;xOx(OH)  2&#8208;x  during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, we for the first time report the rational&#160;design of hierarchical porous  NiCu double hydroxide  nanotyres (NiCu DHTs)  by  considering rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e. annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8208;function&#160;relationship is conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31 V with 7.52 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9 &#181;M), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors. This work deepens the understanding of the crucial role of surface hydroxyls on determining the catalytic performance in alkaline medium.</dc:description>

      <title>Computational insight into the different mechanisms of Ag&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes and sulfonyl hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene can produce important cyclopropane products for synthesis intermediates, material and pharmaceutical applications. However, this reaction is often accompanied by side reactions such as coupling and self&#8208;coupling, so that the yield of cyclopropanation product of non&#8208;silver transition metal carbene and hindered alkene is generally lower than 50%. To solve this problem, addition of a low concentration of diazo compound (decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazones) to alkene catalyzed by either CuOAc or PdCl  2  was studied but side reactions still could not be avoided. Interestingly, however, the yield of cyclopropanation for such hindered alkenes was as high as 99% with AgOTf as catalyst. To explain this unexpected phenomenon, reaction pathways have been computed for four different catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). By combining the results of these calculations with the experimental ones, we concluded that the efficiency of the silver catalyst is due to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step, and the kinetic inhibition of side reaction by a high concentration of alkene.</dc:description>

      <title>An Electron&#8208;Accepting aza&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>
      <dc:description>A bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) approach using an aza&#8208;BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron&#8208;accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) to elaborate a D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with the enhanced fluorescence brightness up to 0.5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8211;1cm&#8211;1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behaviors in emission. The transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#160;&#956;J cm&#8211;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembled binaphthyl&#8208;bridged amphiphilic AABB phthalocyanines: nanostructures for efficient antimicrobial photodynamic&#160;therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral Zn(II)Pcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents) containing differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in water media and have proved efficient in the photoinactivation of S. aureus and E. coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The size average of the nanoparticles is determined by the substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, it influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a non&#8208;substituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PS present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective in killing both types of strains, showing an outstanding photoinactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.</dc:description>

      <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies allows manipulating the subtle equilibria in the given system. We demonstrate this for the case of tetranuclear europium helical cage that is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, we bring the experimental evidence that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky noncoordinating counterions that may trigger self&#8208;assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with noncoordinating anions enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.</dc:description>

Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8208;43%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (  2a)  , ether (  2b  and  2c)  , or triphenylphosphonium salt (  2g  ) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8764; 30%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.</dc:description>

      <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited state compounds. Herein, we study the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state. Though a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, we define a set of guidelines to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components and subsequently test the validity of the guidelines on larger systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Proanthocyanins&#8208;capped biogenic TiO2 nanoparticles with enhanced penetration, antibacterial and ROS mediated inhibition of bacteria proliferation and biofilm formation: A comparative approach</title>
      <dc:description>The biofunctionalized TiO2 NPs, having a size range of 18.42 &#177; 1.3 nm were synthesized employing single step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) mediated proanthocyanins (PACs) polyphenols. The present study purposes to examine the effect of PACs rich GSE corona on (i) the stability and dispersity of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs, their (ii) anti&#8208;proliferative and anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy and (iii) propensity of internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in  P. aeruginosa  and&#160;  S. saprophyticus  strains. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques were used to validate NPs formation. The comparative FTIR spectral analysis demonstrated that PACs linked functional &#8208;OH groups likely played a central role in Ti  4+  reduction, nucleation, formation and stability of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs.&#160;The TEM&#160;and ICP&#8208;MS&#160;analyses confirmed there was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) enhanced intracellular uptake of GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs in tested uropathogens as compare to bare TiO  2  &#8208;NPs. Correspondingly, compared to bare NPs, GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs induced intracellular ROS formation that corresponded well with dose&#8208;dependent inhibitory patterns of cell proliferation and biofilm formation in both the tested strains. Overall, this study demonstrates that &#8208;OH rich PACs of GSE corona on biogenic TiO  2  &#8208;NPs maximized the functional stability, dispersity and propensity of penetration into planktonic cells and biofilm matrices; albeit, such unique merits warranted the GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs as a novel, functionally stable and efficient antibacterial nanoformulation to combat with UTIs menace in clinical settings</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B: Study of the Challenging &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylations</title>
      <dc:description>We report here a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable

antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosylation steps. It features the conclusive use of sulfoxide anomeric leaving&#8208;groups in combination with a remote 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;picoloyl group on the donors allowing highly b&#8208;selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD). The rhamnosylated C1&#8208;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8208;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semi&#8208;glycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2&#8208;naphthylmethyl (Nap) ether on a phenol and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin B.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the regioselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes via lanthanum&#8208;mediated single C&#8208;F bond activation</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new fluorine containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. We herein present the highly regio and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes using a simple La/I  2  /DIBAL&#8208;Cl system via a selective C&#8208;F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provides homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF  2  &#8208;alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron&#8208;poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF  3  group in a diene has been observed, which according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis acidic lanthanum metal.</dc:description>

      <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: a Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>As a significant branch of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have obtained widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities of generating other photo&#8208;responsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photo&#8208;responsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands play a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most of CHPMs are built from photo&#8208;deformable or photo&#8208;responsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost, which greatly restrict their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to explore new families of CHPMs compared with the existing CHPMs. Herein, we report a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs via decorating metal nitrate with coplanar bipyridine moiety 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen). The resulting products exhibit apparent photo&#8208;coloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron&#8208;transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO  3  &#8208;  species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of coordination environment and central metal ions on photochromism have also been studied. Our work has demonstrated that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrate as &#960;&#8208;EDs under the collaboration of ET and coordination assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbone itself might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. Conceptually parallel process could allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we synthesized three types of 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns: a symmetric dimer with a C&#8211;C bond between the monomer units (  1  ) and two asymmetric dimers with a C&#8211;N bond between the monomer units (  2  and  3  ). The structure&#8208;property relationship of  1  &#8211;  3  were investigated. X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis revealed that the two DHDAT units are completely planar in the C&#8211;C linked dimer  1  whereas the monomer units are perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8211;N linked dimers  2  and  3  in the crystals. Reflecting their molecular structures, the electronic interaction between the two monomer units is larger in  1  and very little in  2  and  3  in the ground states. However, the emission behavior of  3  is remarkably different from those of other dimers and its monomer. The dimer  3  shows a clear positive solvatochromism in emission which is characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor type molecules in spite of its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Furthermore, the dimer  3  exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The reason for the different emission behaviors can be attributed to the asymmetric distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.</dc:description>

The dimer  3  shows a clear positive solvatochromism in emission which is characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor type molecules in spite of its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Furthermore, the dimer  3  exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The reason for the different emission behaviors can be attributed to the asymmetric distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Selective cross&#8208;coupling of unsaturated substrates on Al(I)</title>
      <dc:description>The Al(I) compound NacNacAl ( 1 , NacNac = [ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr] &#8210; , Ar = 2,6&#8208; i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 ) serves as a template for the chemoselective coupling between carbonyls (benzophenone, fenchone, isophorone, p &#8208;tolyl benzoate, N,N &#8208;dimethyl benzamide, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline) and pyridine. With the CH&#8208;acidic ketone (1R)&#8208;(+) camphor, the reaction affords a hydrido alkoxide compound of Al, formed as the result of enolization, whereas an enolizable imine, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline, and the bulky ketone isophorone, still chemoselectively couple with pyridine. In contrast, reaction with the ester p &#8208;tolyl benzoate results in cleavage of the ester bond together with replacement of the alkoxy group by a hydrogen atom of the pyridine moiety. This study demonstrates that for carbonyl substrates featuring phenyl substituents, the reaction proceeds via intermediate formation of h 2 (C,X)&#8208;coordinated (X =O, N) carbonyl adducts, whereas the reaction of 1 with (R)&#8208;(&#8210;)&#8208;fenchone in the absence of pyridine leads to CH activation in the pendant isopropyl group of the Ar substituent of the NacNac ligand.</dc:description>

      <title>The Effect of Auxiliary Nitrogenated Linkers on the Design of New Cadmium Based Coordination Polymers as Sensors for Detection of Explosive Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Three new cadmium based coordination polymers denoted: [Cd(hfipbb)(4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipy)]&#183;(  CdPF&#8208;1  ), [Cd(hfipbb)(H  2  O)(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipy)] (  CdPF&#8208;2  ) and [Cd(hfipbb)(1,10&#8208;phen)] (  CdPF&#8208;3  ), have been hydrothermally synthesized using the well&#8208;known V&#8208;shaped organic linker 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfipbb), together with different nitrogenated auxiliary linkers. Considering the d  10  configuration of the transition metal selected, the luminescent properties for theses  CdPF&#8208;n  materials were explored, finding that materials  CdPF&#8208;2  and  CdPF&#8208;3  act as excellent sensors in the detection of explosive materials (NACs: Nitro&#8208;Aromatic Compounds). The photoluminescence properties of  CdPF&#8208;2  and  CdPF&#8208;3  , revealed that significant and sensitive fluorescence quenching was observed toward NP (Nitrophenol) for  CdPF&#8208;2  and PA (Picric Acid) for  CdPF&#8208;3  &#160;in MeOH suspensions.</dc:description>

      <title>De Novo and Divergent Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Furans via Cascade Reactions of 2&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with Nucleophiles</title>
      <dc:description>Divergent synthesis of a variety of 2&#945; and 5&#945; substituted furan derivatives from 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones were reported. By using proper substrate and acid catalyst, the reactions can selectively occur via cyclization/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition cascade or cyclization/Fridel&#8208;Craft type cascade reaction. A broad range of nucleophilic reagents (&gt; 10 types for 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition and &gt; 20 types for Fridel&#8208;Craft type cascade reaction) including alcohol, amide, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, indole, phenol, and many others, can successfully participate in the reaction, providing a universal strategy for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted furan derivatives. Deuteration experiment and DFT calculations were carried out to support the proposed reaction mechanisms. Antifungal activity experiments reveal that products with indole or 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin core substituted at 2&#945; position show moderate activities against Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctorzia solani respectively.</dc:description>
