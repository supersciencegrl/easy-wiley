         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>

The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

&lt;p&gt;Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Au{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe and Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], [Ag{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Au{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. The Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry for the copper and silver cations and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; show the order M=Au (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;gt;Cu (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;gt;Ag (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8594;M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8592;[Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8592;M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;[Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligands into the vacant (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)s and (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)p AOs of M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into vacant ligand orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noncontact temperature sensors&lt;/b&gt; are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Double Bond Isomerization: Evidence for an FeI/FeIII Catalytic Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuterium labelling, electrochemistry, EPR and DFT, an iron catalyzed double bond isomerization reaction was disclosed that is likely to proceed through on&#8208;cycle FeI and FeIII intermediates. The reaction uses an FeII pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes a one&#8208;electron reduction to get to the first on&#8208;cycle species. These studies on mechanism, along with synthetic scope of the reaction, are presented.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated alkene FeI complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an FeIII intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.

         <title>Selection of Planar Chiral Conformations between Pillar[5,6]arenes Induced by Amino Acid Derivatives in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain link to chirality: The &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochloride were recognized by detecting induced CD signals of WP5 or its homologue WP6. The forces involved in selecting the chiral conformation, such as C (or N)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking were illuminated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids play critical roles in the metabolic process in nearly all life forms. So far, chiral recognition of &#945;&#8208;amino acids has mainly focused on the determination of l/d enantiomers. Herein, selection of planar chiral conformations between water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 and pillar[6]arene WP6 was observed due to &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides binding with WP5 and WP6, respectively. Therefore, &#945;&#8208;side chain and ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides were recognized by observing the induced CD signal and its inversion. This is a rare example of being able to detect the chiral region around &#945;&#8208;carbon of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid molecule.

Herein, selection of planar chiral conformations between water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt; and pillar[6]arene &lt;b&gt;WP6&lt;/b&gt; was observed due to &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides binding with &lt;b&gt;WP5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;WP6&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Therefore, &#945;&#8208;side chain and ethyl ester moieties of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides were recognized by observing the induced CD signal and its inversion. This is a rare example of being able to detect the chiral region around &#945;&#8208;carbon of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid molecule.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable glum values in the colloidal solution.

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

What mechanism&#8208;based screening for titanocene catalysis is all about! Combining insights from synthesis and theory with cyclic voltammetry and the rotating ring disk electrode is the deal for understanding not only how but also why condition screening for the titanocene catalyzed radical arylation works.







Abstract
The combination of synthesis, rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, and computational investigations with the aid of DFT methods shows how a thiourea, a squaramide, and a bissulfonamide as additives affect the EqCr equilibrium of Cp2TiCl2. We have, for the first time, provided quantitative data for the EqCr equilibrium and have determined the stoichiometry of adduct formation of [Cp2Ti(III)Cl2]&#8722;, [Cp2Ti(III)Cl] and [Cp2Ti(IV)Cl2] and the additives. By studying the structures of the complexes formed by DFT methods, we have established the Gibbs energies and enthalpies of complex formation as well as the adduct structures. The results not only demonstrate the correctness of our use of the EqCr equilibrium as predictor for sustainable catalysis. They are also a design platform for the development of novel additives in particular for enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>Rational Development of Guanidinate and Amidinate Based Cerium and Ytterbium Complexes as Atomic Layer Deposition Precursors: Synthesis, Modeling, and Application</title>

Systematic engineering of Ce and Yb based amidinate and guanidinate complexes resulted in precursors suitable for atomic layer deposition (ALD) applications. Computational modeling reveals the reactivity of the complexes towards water and oxygen. A water assisted ALD process for the growth of CeO2 thin films was demonstrated with the Ce tris&#8208;guanidinate precursor.







Abstract
Owing to the limited availability of suitable precursors for vapor phase deposition of rare&#8208;earth containing thin&#8208;film materials, new or improved precursors are sought after. In this study, we explored new precursors for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) containing thin films. A series of homoleptic tris&#8208;guanidinate and tris&#8208;amidinate complexes of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The C&#8208;substituents on the N&#8208;C&#8208;N backbone (Me, NMe2, NEt2, where Me=methyl, Et=ethyl) and the N&#8208;substituents from symmetrical iso&#8208;propyl (iPr) to asymmetrical tertiary&#8208;butyl (tBu) and Et were systematically varied to study the influence of the substituents on the physicochemical properties of the resulting compounds. Single crystal structures of [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 and [Yb(dpdmg)3] 6 (dpdmg=N,N'&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate) highlight a monomeric nature in the solid&#8208;state with a distorted trigonal prismatic geometry. The thermogravimetric analysis shows that the complexes are volatile and emphasize that increasing asymmetry in the complexes lowers their melting points while reducing their thermal stability. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the reactivity of amidinates and guanidinates of Ce and Yb complexes towards oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Signified by the DFT calculations, the guanidinates show an increased reactivity toward water compared to the amidinate complexes. Furthermore, the Ce complexes are more reactive compared to the Yb complexes, indicating even a reactivity towards oxygen potentially exploitable for ALD purposes. As a representative precursor, the highly reactive [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 was used for proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle ALD depositions of CeO2 thin films using water as co&#8208;reactant. The self&#8208;limited ALD growth process could be confirmed at 160&#8201;&#176;C with polycrystalline cubic CeO2 films formed on Si(100) substrates. This study confirms that moving towards nitrogen&#8208;coordinated rare&#8208;earth complexes bearing the guanidinate and amidinate ligands can indeed be very appealing in terms of new precursors for ALD of rare earth based materials.

         <title>Guided Antitumoural Drugs: (Imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)(L)gold(I) Complexes Seeking Cellular Targets Controlled by the Nature of Ligand L</title>

Striking gold: Through the choice of their secondary ligand L, a series of [4,5&#8208;diarylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes targeted different cancer cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria or lysosomes) where they interfered beneficially with molecular targets, such as DNA, thioredoxin reductase, or lysosomal membranes, to elicit p53&#8208;independent apoptosis. Such guided metallodrugs will help to minimise unwanted side effects by addressing limited arrays of targets.







Abstract
Three [1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes, 4&#8201;a (L=Cl), 5&#8201;a (L=PPh3), and 6&#8201;a (L=same N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)), and their fluorescent [4&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) analogues, 4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;b, respectively, were studied for their localisation and effects in cancer cells. Despite their identical NHC ligands, the last three accumulated in different compartments of melanoma cells, namely, the nucleus (4&#8201;b), mitochondria (5&#8201;b), or lysosomes (6&#8201;b). Ligand L was also more decisive for the site of accumulation than the NHC ligand because the couples 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;a/5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, carrying different NHC ligands, afforded similar results in cytotoxicity tests, and tests on targets typically found at their sites of accumulation, such as DNA in nuclei, reactive oxygen species and thioredoxin reductase in mitochondria, and lysosomal membranes. Regardless of the site of accumulation, cancer cell apoptosis was eventually induced. The concept of guiding a bioactive complex fragment to a particular subcellular target by secondary ligand L could reduce unwanted side effects.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Striking gold&lt;/b&gt;: Through the choice of their secondary ligand L, a series of [4,5&#8208;diarylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes targeted different cancer cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria or lysosomes) where they interfered beneficially with molecular targets, such as DNA, thioredoxin reductase, or lysosomal membranes, to elicit p53&#8208;independent apoptosis. Such guided metallodrugs will help to minimise unwanted side effects by addressing limited arrays of targets.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Carbazole Derivatives as Host Materials for Highly Efficient and Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Extended host: Expansion of the &#960; conjugation of a carbazole derivative by benzothiophene units enhances its performance as a host in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. The &#960;&#8208;extended host material exhibits lower efficiency roll&#8208;off and longer operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance (LT50) of approximately 23&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 compared with conventional host materials.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100&#8201;% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;bis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)biphenyl (mCBP) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, the &#960; conjugation of the carbazole unit was expanded to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely m1BTCBP and m4BTCBP. Among these host materials, m1BTCBP formed a highly efficient [Ir(ppy)3]&#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT50) of over 300&#8197;h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (current density: 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The LT50 value at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was estimated to be about 23&#8201;000&#8197;h. This performance is clearly higher than that of mCBP&#8208;based OLEDs (LT50&#8776;8500&#8197;h).

         <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8208;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4985-4992, March 12, 2021. </description>

Pincer ligands: Paramagnetic (M=FeII, CoII) and diamagnetic (M=NiII, CuI, ZnII) mononuclear (M=FeII, CoII, NiII, ZnII) and binuclear (M=CuI) complexes supported by a PGeP pincer chloridogermyl ligand have been prepared from reactions of a dipyrromethane&#8208;derived PGeP germylene with the corresponding metal(II) chlorides.







Abstract
The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2, with late first&#8208;row transition metal (Fe&#8208;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2 and CoCl2 afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M=Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintained an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0&#8197;&#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380&#8197;K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varied linearly with temperature from 1.9&#8197;&#956;B at 10&#8197;K to 3.6&#8197;&#956;B at 380&#8197;K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves S1/2 (predominant at T&lt;180&#8197;K) and S3/2 (predominant at T&gt;200&#8197;K) species. Both cobalt(II) species were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance at T&lt;20&#8197;K. The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme=dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2 involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}2], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl2 led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}].

SC&#8208;SC PSM: Postsynthetic single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal modification of metal&#8211;organic framework Co&#8208;MOF with electrically conducting EtpyBr and photoconductive AgNO3 produced Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF. Incorporation of conductive polyaniline (PANI) into these MOF matrices yielded three PANI/MOFs with outstanding conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). PANI/Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and PANI/Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF show enhanced Seebeck coefficient and photocurrent density, respectively.







Abstract
A 3D Co&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Co&#8208;MOF) with two kinds of large pores filled by free Co2+ ions and ligands was synthesized and characterized. To expand the MOF structure and conductivity, the free Co2+ ions and ligands were exchanged by conductive ionic liquid EtpyBr and photosensitive AgNO3 through single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal transformation, which produced structure&#8208;changed 3D MOFs Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF, which were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Incorporating small quantities of doped polyaniline (PANI) with redox activity into the pores could further tune the stability and conductivity of the three MOFs. The PANI/MOFs all show outstanding electrical conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and PANI/Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br has the largest p&#8208;type Seebeck coefficient of 66.6&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;K&#8722;1. PANI/Co&#8208;MOF&#8208;Br and PANI/Co&#8208;Ag&#8208;MOF have 4 and 15 times higher photocurrent density compared with PANI/Co&#8208;MOF, respectively. This work sheds light on the design of advanced electrically conductive 3D MOFs.

         <title>Sensitive and Visual Detection of Phosgene by a TICT&#8208;Based BODIPY Dye with 8&#8208;(o&#8208;Hydroxy)aniline as the Active Site</title>

Sense and sensitivity: The fluorescent probe with 8&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy)phenyl as the active site (o&#8208;Pha) exhibits better sensing performance than the 8&#8208;(3&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy)phenyl (o&#8208;Pah). Furthermore, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe (o&#8208;Phae) has been contrasted through extending conjugation of o&#8208;Pha for colorimetric and fluorescent detections of phosgene and its substitutes in both solutions and gas phase.







Abstract
Phosgene and its substitutes (diphosgene and triphosgene) are widely utilized as chemical industrial materials and chemical warfare agents and pose a threat to public health and environmental safety due to their extreme toxicity. Research efforts have been directed to develop selective and sensitive detection methods for phosgene and its substitutes. In this paper, we have prepared two BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes, o&#8208;Pah and o&#8208;Pha, which are two isomers with different active sites, ortho&#8208;aminohydroxy (3&#8242;,4&#8242; or 4&#8242;,3&#8242;) phenyls at meso position of BODIPY, and compared their sensing performance toward triphosgene. The probe with o&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl), o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the o&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl), o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34&#8197;nm vs. 1.2&#8197;nm), and more rapid response (10&#8197;s vs. 200&#8197;s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of o&#8208;Pha. The probe o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60&#8197;s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD=0.88&#8197;nm), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&lt;2&#8197;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.

         <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4993-5002, March 12, 2021. </description>

Energy storage: A molecular solar thermal battery is presented, which is based on modified norbornadiene (NBD)/quadricyclane (QC) photoswitches and magnetic nanoparticle catalysts. A library of NBD/QC derivatives is prepared with absorption onsets of up to 450&#8197;nm, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and long storage potentials (t1/2 up to 611&#8197;days). Detailed performance analysis of the novel magnetic NP catalysts is conducted, revealing stability against desorption and high activity with initial TOFs of 3.64&#8197;s&#8722;1 and TON of more than 3305.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts are immobilized on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysts toward an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles through exploitation of the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins, a 22.6&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC&#8208;NBD back&#8208;conversion is achieved, with an initial TOF of up to 3.64&#8197;s&#8722;1 and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, a series of novel &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; functionalized norbornadiene derivatives is prepared, featuring excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366&#8197;nm, quantum yields around 70&#8201;%, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and outstanding thermal stability with t1/2 (25&#8201;&#176;C) over 100&#8197;days. Finally, the energy storage potential of these molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems is harnessed in a heat release experiment. This demonstrates the potential of norbornadiene&#8208;based photoswitches in combination with efficient magnetic catalysts for the generation of environmentally benign process heat.

Trapped in ice: A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight MS study provides evidence of the generation of three previously elusive organosilicon molecules in silane&#8211;CO2 ices exposed to energetic electrons. The molecules were also identified through their isotope shifts in deuterated and 18O&#8208;substituted samples. PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS should help identify further complex silicon molecules that cannot be identified by traditional methods.







Abstract
The identification of silicon&#8208;substituted, complex organics carrying multiple functional groups by classical infrared spectroscopy is challenging because the group frequencies of functional groups often overlap. Photoionization (PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;fight mass spectrometry (ReTOF&#8208;MS) in combination with temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) holds certain advantages because molecules are identified after sublimation from the matrix into in the gas phase based on distinct ionization energies and sublimation temperatures.

A cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles enables an allylarylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with aryl boronates and allylic carbonates to allow access to a wide variety of carbon skeletons.







Abstract
An allylarylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes with aryl boronates and allylic carbonates has been developed. This method allows access to a wide variety of carbon skeletons from readily available starting materials. Mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is enabled by a cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII/PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles.

Cause and effect: The fluorescence of SeU in the context of ribosomal RNA and in the presence of antibiotic paromomycin has been investigated by means of computational methods. Our results explain why the probe does not emit if antibiotics are not present and which factors are the most important to control fluorescence.







Abstract
We unveil in this work the main factors that govern the turn&#8208;on/off fluorescence of a Se&#8208;modified uracil probe at the ribosomal RNA A&#8208;site. Whereas the constraint into an &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; conformation of the two rings of the fluorophore is the main driver for the observed turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission in the presence of the antibiotic paromomycin, the electrostatics of the environment plays a minor role during the emission process. Our computational strategy clearly indicates that, in the absence of paromomycin, the probe prefers conformations that show a dark S1 electronic state with participation of n&#960;* electronic transition contributions between the selenium atom and the &#960;&#8208;system of the uracil moiety.

Hybrid coordination polymers: The AgI monomer [Ag{[Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)]}3][TEF] ([TEF]=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]) was obtained by reaction of the organometallic diarsene complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)] with Ag[TEF]. In solution, this compound is in equilibrium with another monomeric species, [Ag{[Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)]}2][TEF], exhibiting a less&#8208;saturated AgI center. This solution mixture reacts with a variety of ditopic pyridine&#8208;based organic linkers to afford selectively 1D and 2D organometallic&#8208;organic hybrid assemblies, including a helix&#8208;like 1D structure.







Abstract
The reaction of the organometallic diarsene complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#951;2&#8208;As2)] (1) with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] (Ag[TEF]) yielded the AgI monomer [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;1)3][TEF] (2). This compound exhibits dynamic behavior in solution, which allows directed selective synthesis of unprecedented organometallic&#8211;organic hybrid assemblies upon its reaction with N&#8208;donor organic molecules by a stepwise pathway, which is supported by DFT calculations. Accordingly, the reaction of 2 with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrimidine (L1) yielded the dicationic molecular compound [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)2Ag}2(&#956;&#8208;L1)][TEF]2 (3) or the 1D polymer [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}(&#956;&#8208;L1)]n[TEF]n (4) depending on the ratio of the reactants. However, its reactions with the pyridine&#8208;based linkers 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (L2), 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (L3) and 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne (L4) allowed the formation of the 2D polymers [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}2(&#956;&#8208;Lx)3]n[TEF]2n [Lx=L2 (5), L3 (6), L4 (7), respectively]. Additionally, this concept was extended to step&#8208;by&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reactions of 1, [Ag(CH3CN)3][Al{OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4] ([Ag(CH3CN)3][TEFCl]) and linkers L2&#8211;L4 to produce the 2D polymers [{(&#951;2&#8208;1)Ag}2(&#956;,Lx)3]n[TEFCl]2n [Lx=L2 (8), L3 (9), L4 (10), respectively].

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Amphiphilic AABB Phthalocyanines: Nanostructures for Efficient Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Cationic nanoparticles formed by self&#8208;assembly of binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked amphiphilic AABB ZnII phthalocyanines in water are explored as new models for the efficient delivery of photosensitizers to bacteria. Photo&#8208;inactivation studies show an unusually high activity of the nanoparticles in killing the Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine (pc)&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral ZnIIPcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents). They contain differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous media and have proved efficient in the photo&#8208;inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The average size of the nanoparticles was determined by substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a nonsubstituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than the octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PSs present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective at killing both types of strain, showing an outstanding photo&#8208;inactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli.

         <title>Cations and Anions of Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene and Reduction of a Dibenzo[a,e]pentalenophane</title>

Aromatic character in a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) was observed upon chemical oxidation to the cation radical and dication and reduction to the anion radical, as found from solid&#8208;state structures. In a bent DBP&#8208;phane aromaticity could not be reached upon reduction, and stabilization though proton abstraction occurred.







Abstract
Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a non&#8208;alternant conjugated hydrocarbon with antiaromatic character and ambipolar electrochemical behavior. Upon both reduction and oxidation, it becomes aromatic. We herein study the chemical oxidation and reduction of a planar DBP derivative and a bent DBP&#8208;phane. The molecular structures of its planar dication, cation radical and anion radical in the solid state demonstrate the gained aromaticity through bond length equalization, which is supported by nucleus independent chemical shift&#8208;calculations. EPR spectra on the cation radical confirm the spin delocalization over the DBP framework. A similar delocalization was not possible in the reduced bent DBP&#8208;phane, which stabilized itself by proton abstraction from a solvent molecule upon reduction. This is the first report on structures of a DBP cation radical and dication in the solid state and of a reduced bent DBP derivative. Our study provides valuable insight into the charged species of DBP for its application as semiconductor.

Now that's radical! The reactions of linear metal(I) complexes (M=Cr&#8211;Fe) with simple pyridines leads to the reductive coupling of the substrates through intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation, which can be reversible, as shown for iron. For fluoropyridines, C&#8722;F bond cleavage is preferred, leading to rare low&#8208;coordinate metal(II) fluorides (see scheme). The structure of a rare 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;free pyridyl radical anion is also presented.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the facile reduction of pyridine (and its derivatives) by linear 3d&#8208;metal(I) silylamides (M=Cr&#8211;Co). This reaction resulted in intermolecular C&#8722;C coupling to give dinuclear metal(II) complexes bearing a bridging 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydrobipyridyl ligand. For iron, we demonstrated that the C&#8722;C coupling is reversible in solution, either directly or by reaction with substrates, via a presumed monomeric metal(II) complex bearing a pyridyl radical anion. In the course of this investigation, we also observed that the dinuclear metal(II) complex incorporating iron facilitated the isomerisation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene as well as equimolar amounts of benzene and cyclohexene. Furthermore, we synthesised and structurally characterised a non&#8208;3d&#8208;metal&#8208;bound pyridyl radical anion. The reactions of the silylamides with perfluoropyridine led to C&#8722;F bond cleavage with the formation of metal(II) fluoride complexes of manganese, iron and cobalt along with the homocoupling or reductive degradation of the substrate. In the case of cobalt, the use of lesser fluorinated pyridines led to C&#8722;F bond cleavage but no homocoupling. Overall, in this paper we provide insights into the multifaceted behaviour of simple (fluoro)pyridines in the presence of moderately to highly reducing metal complexes.

         <title>Spin State Tunes Oxygen Atom Transfer towards FeIVO Formation in FeII Complexes</title>

Spin control: The formation of oxoiron(IV) complexes by the reaction of iron(II) precursors bearing tetradentate N ligands with IO4&#8722; occurs through a fast spin&#8208;crossover pre&#8208;equilibrium followed by rate&#8208;determining substitution to form an intermediate that leads rapidly to the FeIV=O species. The experimental kinetic and activation parameters highlight a key role played the spin in controlling the reaction.







Abstract
Oxoiron(IV) complexes bearing tetradentate ligands have been extensively studied as models for the active oxidants in non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent enzymes. These species are commonly generated by oxidation of their ferrous precursors. The mechanisms of these reactions have seldom been investigated. In this work, the reaction kinetics of complexes [FeII(CH3CN)2L](SbF6)2 ([1](SbF6)2 and [2](SbF6)2) and [FeII(CF3SO3)2L] ([1](OTf)2 and [2](OTf)2 (1, L=Me,HPytacn; 2, L=nP,HPytacn; R,R&#8242;Pytacn=1&#8208;[(6&#8208;R&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]&#8208;4,7&#8208; di&#8208;R&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane) with Bu4NIO4 to form the corresponding [FeIV(O)(CH3CN)L]2+ (3, L=Me,HPytacn; 4, L=nP,HPytacn) species was studied in acetonitrile/acetone at low temperatures. The reactions occur in a single kinetic step with activation parameters independent of the nature of the anion and similar to those obtained for the substitution reaction with Cl&#8722; as entering ligand, which indicates that formation of [FeIV(O)(CH3CN)L]2+ is kinetically controlled by substitution in the starting complex to form [FeII(IO4)(CH3CN)L]+ intermediates that are converted rapidly to oxo complexes 3 and 4. The kinetics of the reaction is strongly dependent on the spin state of the starting complex. A detailed analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and kinetic data for the triflate complexes reveals that the experimental values of the activation parameters for both complexes are the result of partial compensation of the contributions from the thermodynamic parameters for the spin&#8208;crossover equilibrium and the activation parameters for substitution. The observation of these opposite and compensating effects by modifying the steric hindrance at the ligand illustrates so far unconsidered factors governing the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer leading to high&#8208;valent iron oxo species.

In this work, the reaction kinetics of complexes [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L](SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;[1](SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;[2](SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L] (&lt;b&gt;[1](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;[2](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, L=&lt;sup&gt;Me,H&lt;/sup&gt;Pytacn; &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, L=&lt;sup&gt;nP,H&lt;/sup&gt;Pytacn; &lt;sup&gt;R,R&#8242;&lt;/sup&gt;Pytacn=1&#8208;[(6&#8208;R&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]&#8208;4,7&#8208; di&#8208;R&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane) with Bu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to form the corresponding [Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(O)(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)L]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, L=&lt;sup&gt;Me,H&lt;/sup&gt;Pytacn; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, L=&lt;sup&gt;nP,H&lt;/sup&gt;Pytacn) species was studied in acetonitrile/acetone at low temperatures. The reactions occur in a single kinetic step with activation parameters independent of the nature of the anion and similar to those obtained for the substitution reaction with Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as entering ligand, which indicates that formation of [Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(O)(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)L]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is kinetically controlled by substitution in the starting complex to form [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)L]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intermediates that are converted rapidly to oxo complexes &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. The kinetics of the reaction is strongly dependent on the spin state of the starting complex. A detailed analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and kinetic data for the triflate complexes reveals that the experimental values of the activation parameters for both complexes are the result of partial compensation of the contributions from the thermodynamic parameters for the spin&#8208;crossover equilibrium and the activation parameters for substitution. The observation of these opposite and compensating effects by modifying the steric hindrance at the ligand illustrates so far unconsidered factors governing the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer leading to high&#8208;valent iron oxo species.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Postfunctionalization of Dye Layers on TiO2 &#8212; A Tool for Enhancing Injection in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>

Layered approach to capture the sun: We present a sequential covalent/non&#8208;covalent functionalization pathway for metal oxide nanoparticles. Initially a first ligand layer is attached via covalent anchoring of carboxylates, followed by a highly versatile addition of a second dye layer via hydrogen bonding. The resulting hierarchical hybrid architectures were investigated regarding their photophysical properties and finally implemented in sandwich&#8208;type dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) configurations, resulting in an efficiency increase of up to 43&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report on newly tailored dye layers, which were employed, on one hand, for covalent deposition and, on the other hand, for non&#8208;covalently post&#8208;functionalizing TiO2 nanoparticle films. Our functionalization concept enabled intermixing a stable covalent attachment of a first layer with a highly versatile and reversible hydrogen bonding through the Hamilton receptor&#8211;cyanuric acid binding motif as a second layer. Following this concept, we integrated step&#8208;by&#8208;step a first porphyrin layer and a second porphyrin/BODIPY layer. The individual building blocks and their corresponding combinations were probed with regard to their photophysical properties, and the most promising combinations were implemented in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Relative to the first porphyrin layer adding the second porphyrin/BODIPY layers increased the overall DSSC efficiency by up to 43&#8201;%.

         <title>HNO to NO Conversion Mechanism with Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase, Comparison with Heme Protein Mediated Conversions, and the Origin of Questionable Reversibility</title>

Similarities and differences: This reaction is important for NO formation and HNO detection. Calculations provide the first theoretical mechanistic information on the nonheme protein mediated process and many previously unknown mechanistic similarities and differences compared with those of conversions mediated by heme proteins. Importantly, the first kinetically feasible and thermodynamically favorable mechanism is shown.







Abstract
The interconversion of NO and HNO, via copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), is important in biomedicine and for HNO detection. Many mechanistic questions, including the decades&#8208;long debate on reversibility, were resolved in this work. Calculations of various active&#8208;site and full&#8208;protein models show that the basic mechanism is proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with a computed barrier of 10.98&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is in excellent agreement with experimental results (10.62&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and this nonheme protein&#8208;mediated reaction has many significant mechanistic differences compared with the conversions mediated by heme proteins due to geometric and electronic factors. The reasons for the irreversible nature of this conversion and models with the first thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible mechanism for the experimental reverse reaction were discovered. Such results are the first for nonheme enzyme mediated HNO to NO conversions, which shall facilitate other related studies and HNO probe development.

         <title>Frontispiece: Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 2&#8208;Pyrones: Bridged Lactones and Beyond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, March 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions involving electron&#8208;poor 2&#8208;pyrones as electrophilic dienes provide an efficient access to bridged bicyclic lactones and their derivatives, such as densely functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes after CO2 extrusion and polysubstituted aromatic compounds through elimination. Owing to the great versatility of possible products, this reaction has been used in the synthesis of many biologically active natural molecules and drug candidates, stimulating the development of novel methodologies to control regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity during the last few decades.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand&lt;/b&gt; Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions involving electron&#8208;poor 2&#8208;pyrones as electrophilic dienes provide an efficient access to bridged bicyclic lactones and their derivatives, such as densely functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes after CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extrusion and polysubstituted aromatic compounds through elimination. Owing to the great versatility of possible products, this reaction has been used in the synthesis of many biologically active natural molecules and drug candidates, stimulating the development of novel methodologies to control regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity during the last few decades.

         <title>Frontispiece: Transition Metal&#8208;Promoted Reactions in Aqueous Media and Biological Settings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, March 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For years it has been considered that transition metal catalysis was incompatible with water, and even less with biologically relevant aqueous environments. However, an increasing number of reports are demonstrating the viability of achieving organometallic reactions in such media, and even in live cells. Most of these reactions consists of deprotection processes (mainly deallylations or depropargylations), however a variety of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;promoted bond&#8208;forming processes, from cross&#8208;couplings to cycloadditions, have also been developed. For the full story see the review article by F. L&#243;pez, J.&#8197;L. Mascare&#241;as et&#8197;al. on page 4789.

         <dc:description>
Diquinane or bicyclo[3.3.0]octane is a conspicuous structural unit existing in the carbo&#8208;frameworks of a wide range of natural products such as alkaloids and terpenoids. These diquinane&#8208;containing molecules not merely exhibit intriguing architectures, but also showcase a broad spectrum of significant bioactivities, which draw widespread attention from the global synthetic community. In their Minireview on page 4839, H. Li, J. Zhang, and X. She, demonstrate the achievements in this area in the timeline from 2010 to June 2020 and discuss how the diquinane unit is strategically forged in the context of the specific target structure.

         <title>Front Cover: Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals (Chem. Eur. J. 15/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4755-4755, March 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithioacetals are frequently used in organic chemistry, but examples of unsymmetrical dithioacetals are less common, presumably due to the lack of a general synthetic protocol towards these compounds. A direct synthesis of a variety of unsymmetrical dithioacetals with one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the aldehyde and thiols has been developed. Statistical product distribution is overcome by kinetic control delivering unsymmetrical dithioacetals in high yields. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Bognar and M. van&#8197;Gemmeren on page 4859.

The nucleophilic addition of phosphites to a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative gave &#945;&#8208;hydrophosphates and enol phosphates as kinetic and thermodynamic products, respectively. Different from classical Abramov reactions, which give phosphonates bearing a P&#8722;C bond, these products possess a P&#8722;O bond. Theoretical calculations suggested that the charge delocalization of zwitterionic intermediates along with the &#960;&#8208;framework facilitate the phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement, thus forming nonclassical Abramov products. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Murata et&#8197;al. on page 4864.

In this Review, we describe the most relevant advances towards translating the potential of transition metal catalysts to biological settings, including living cells or small&#8208;animal models such as mice or zebrafish. We pay especial attention to the molecular and mechanistic aspects of the transformations.







Abstract
During the last decade, there has been a tremendous interest for developing non&#8208;natural biocompatible transformations in biologically relevant media. Among the different encountered strategies, the use of transition metal complexes offers unique possibilities due to their high transformative power. However, translating the potential of metal catalysts to biological settings, including living cells or small&#8208;animal models such as mice or zebrafish, poses numerous challenges associated to their biocompatibility, and their stability and reactivity in crowded aqueous environments. Herein, we describe the most relevant advances in this direction, with a particular emphasis on the systems&#8217; structure, their mode of action and the mechanistic bases of each transformation. Thus, the key challenges from an organometallic perspective might be more easily identified.

&lt;p&gt;During the last decade, there has been a tremendous interest for developing non&#8208;natural biocompatible transformations in biologically relevant media. Among the different encountered strategies, the use of transition metal complexes offers unique possibilities due to their high transformative power. However, translating the potential of metal catalysts to biological settings, including living cells or small&#8208;animal models such as mice or zebrafish, poses numerous challenges associated to their biocompatibility, and their stability and reactivity in crowded aqueous environments. Herein, we describe the most relevant advances in this direction, with a particular emphasis on the systems&#8217; structure, their mode of action and the mechanistic bases of each transformation. Thus, the key challenges from an organometallic perspective might be more easily identified.&lt;/p&gt;

Going with the flow: This Minireview summarizes the most recent reports (2017&#8211;2020) on continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of functional molecules. Notably, several complex active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been prepared by the continuous&#8208;flow approach. Key technologies to the successes and remaining challenges are discussed. These results exemplify the feasibility of using modern continuous&#8208;flow chemistry for complex synthetic targets, and bode well for the future development of integrated, automated artificial synthetic systems.







Abstract
Continuous&#8208;flow multi&#8208;step synthesis takes the advantages of microchannel flow chemistry and may transform the conventional multi&#8208;step organic synthesis by using integrated synthetic systems. To realize the goal, however, innovative chemical methods and techniques are urgently required to meet the significant remaining challenges. In the past few years, by using green reactions, telescoped chemical design, and/or novel in&#8208;line separation techniques, major and rapid advancement has been made in this direction.

Abstract
Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions of electron&#8208;poor 2&#8208;pyrones as electrophilic dienes have been extensively studied in the past fifty years. These reactions provide an efficient access to bridged bicyclic lactones and their derivatives, such as densely functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes after CO2 extrusion and polysubstituted aromatic compounds through elimination. This reaction has been used for the synthesis of many biologically active natural products and drug candidates. In this review, the developments of these IEDDA reactions including non&#8208;catalytic, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic IEDDA reactions, and their applications in total synthesis are discussed in detail.

Natural products bearing a diquinane motif generally exhibit complex intriguing architectures as well as significant bioactivities. Aiming to their total synthesis, a variety of methods have been developed to construct this prevalent substructure in recent years. In this Minireview, the methods for construction of diquinane motif reported in the past decade (2010&#8211;2020) are summarized and discussed in the context of natural product total synthesis.







Abstract
Diquinane or bicyclo[3.3.0]octane is a conspicuous structural unit existing in the carbo&#8208;frameworks of a wide range of natural products such as alkaloids and terpenoids. These diquinane&#8208;containing molecules not merely exhibit intriguing architectures, but also showcase a broad spectrum of significant bioactivities, which draw widespread attention from the global synthetic community. During the past decade, with an aim to accomplish the total syntheses of such specified cornucopias of natural products, a variety of elegant strategies for construction of the diquinane ring system have been disclosed. In this Minireview, the achievements on this subject in the timeline from 2010 to June 2020 are demonstrated and it is discussed how the diquinane unit is strategically forged in the context of the specific target structure. In addition, impacts of the selected works to the field of natural product total synthesis is highlighted and the particular outlook of diquinane&#8208;containing natural product synthesis is provided.

         <title>Nonclassical Abramov Products Formed on Orifices of Cage&#8208;Opened C60 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4864-4868, March 12, 2021. </description>

Contrary to classical Abramov reactions, which give phosphonates bearing a P&#8722;C bond, the nucleophilic addition of phosphites to conjugate macrocyclic orifices on cage&#8208;opened C60 derivatives resulted in the formation of phosphates bearing a P&#8722;O bond via phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement as a key step.







Abstract
By nucleophilic addition of phosphite P(OMe)3 to a cage&#8208;opened C60 derivative, &#945;&#8208;hydrophosphate and enol phosphate were obtained as kinetic and thermodynamic products, respectively. Different from classical Abramov products bearing a phosphorus&#8211;carbon bond, these products have a phosphorus&#8211;oxygen bond. The observed anomaly originates from the fully conjugated &#960; system, which significantly stabilizes zwitterionic intermediates bearing a phosphorus&#8211;oxygen bond. The thus formed enol phosphate was found to exhibit an intense absorption band that extended to 730&#8197;nm, reflecting the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transitions. We also report domino phosphorylation reactions, which gave a cage&#8208;opened C60 derivative bearing a direct P&#8722;C bond.

         <title>Synthesis of Co3O4/Carbon Heteroaerogels with Ultrahigh Capacitance via Polyethyleneimine Intercalation of Co2BIM4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4876-4882, March 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework Co2BIM4 nanosheets&#8208;based Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC heteroaerogel is developed as a novel supercapacitor electrode through polyethyleneimine intercalation strategy, which shows ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2568&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, remarkable rate capability (1747&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1at a drastically increased current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance preservation of 92.7&#8201;% after 10000&#8201;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs&#8208;derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we developed a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co2BIM4, BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co3O4/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC heteroaerogels were obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co2BIM4 nanosheets and following by carbonizing the resulting Co2BIM4/PEI composite. The Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC electrode possessed 3D conductive framework with an overlapped hetero&#8208;interface and expanded interlayers, leading to fast and stable charge transfer/diffusion and an enhanced pseudocapacitance performance. Therefore, the Co2BIM4&#8208;Co3O4/NC electrode showed ultrahigh capacitance of 2568&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 1747&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and excellent long cycling time with a capacitance preservation of 92.7&#8201;% following 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is very promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs&#8208;derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we developed a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NC heteroaerogels were obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets and following by carbonizing the resulting Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PEI composite.

Nickela&#8208;electrothiolation: A nascent co&#8208;operation between nickel catalysis and electrochemical synthesis to bring forth cross&#8208;electrophile thiolation of alkyl bromides.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing molecules are of utmost topical importance towards the effective development of pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we present an efficient and mild electrochemical thiolation by cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl bromides with functionalized bench&#8208;stable thiosulfonates to access alkyl sulfides with excellent efficacy and broad functional group tolerance. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic analysis were performed to elucidate mechanistic insights into this electrocatalytic thiolation reaction.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4859-4863, March 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
No symmetry: A general protocol for the direct synthesis of unsymmetrical dithioacetals is reported. A variety of unsymmetrical S,S&#8208;acetals consisting of one (hetero)aromatic and one aliphatic thiol bearing diverse functional groups is synthesized in excellent yields. A high selectivity towards the mixed product is achieved through a kinetically controlled reaction and renders this protocol attractive for the generation of compound libraries.







Abstract
Dithioacetals are a frequently used motif in synthetic organic chemistry and have recently seen increasing attention as structural motif in promising antiviral agents against plant pathogens. Most existing reports, however, only discuss symmetrical dithioacetals. Examples of mixed dithioacetals are scarce and no general method for the selective synthesis of these compounds exists. Herein, a synthetically simple general one&#8208;step protocol was developed for the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical dithioacetals consisting of one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the corresponding aldehyde/thiol mixture. The mixed S,S&#8208;acetals were obtained in high yields, and a great variety of functional groups was tolerated. Kinetic control enabled an excellent selectivity in regard to the unsymmetrical dithioacetal.

The more the merrier: Hierarchical porous NiCu double hydroxide nanotyres (NiCu DHTs) with hydroxyl&#8208;rich interfaces are designed to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency, exhibiting excellent activity, stability, and sensitivity for the ammonia oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The surface hydroxyl groups of NixCu1&#8722;x(OH)2 play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8722;xOx(OH)2&#8722;x during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, the rational design of hierarchical porous NiCu double hydroxide nanotyres (NiCu DHTs) was reported for the first time by considering hydroxyl&#8208;rich interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e., annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;function relationship was conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31&#8197;V with 7.52&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#8197;V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9&#8197;&#956;m), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors. This work deepens the understanding of the crucial role of surface hydroxyl groups on determining the catalytic performance in alkaline medium.

We have developed a one&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds under base, acid, and ligand&#8208;free conditions using molecular oxygen as terminal re&#8208;oxidant. This reaction provided allylic silane including allylic amine framework along with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity via oxidative amination mechanism.







Abstract
A highly regioselective and stereoselective difunctionalization reaction of 1,3&#8208;diene with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds via a one&#8208;step Pd/Cu/O2 system is disclosed. The difunctionalization reaction affords allylic silanes, including the allylic amine moiety, in up to 92&#8201;% yield in the absence of any acid, base, or external ligand. The developed synthetic methodology can be scaled to 100&#8197;g in high yield with high Z&#8208;selectivity, which demonstrates the feasibility of the reaction for industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;A highly regioselective and stereoselective difunctionalization reaction of 1,3&#8208;diene with amine and disilane to form C&#8722;N and C&#8722;Si bonds via a one&#8208;step Pd/Cu/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system is disclosed. The difunctionalization reaction affords allylic silanes, including the allylic amine moiety, in up to 92&#8201;% yield in the absence of any acid, base, or external ligand. The developed synthetic methodology can be scaled to 100&#8197;g in high yield with high &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;selectivity, which demonstrates the feasibility of the reaction for industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning Tetrazole Photochemistry for Protein Ligation and Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 15, Page 4893-4897, March 12, 2021. </description>

Tetrazole&#8208;based photolabelling of antibodies for PET. Tuning the photophysical properties of di&#8208;aryl tetrazole scaffolds can induce a bathochromic shift in the photoactivation window that facilitates protein ligation at long wavelengths. Photoactivatable metal binding chelates functionalised with a tetrazole are developed for applications in light&#8208;induced photoradiolabelling of monoclonal antibodies for positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395&#8197;nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and the aza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with 89Zr, 64Cu and 68Ga radionuclides. DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with 89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based binding assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable in vitro retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.

Ruby Red: Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed butadiene&#8208;mediated benzannulation enables the first synthesis of 3,10&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl)rubicene and its N&#8208;doped derivatives as well as preliminary studies on their photophysical properties.

Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

         <title>Controlling Emissive Properties by Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds: Alkyl and Aryl meso&#8208;Substituted Porphycenes</title>

Abstract
Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, four&#8208;fold meso substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents, this effect is small. To explain this difference, we have synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as the 9,20&#8208;diphenyl and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl derivatives. Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of the six porphycenes, combined with quantum chemical calculations, shows a clear correlation between the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and the efficiency of the radiationless depopulation of the lowest&#8208;excited singlet state. This result led us to propose a model in which the delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. The finding of a correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.

Abstract
We report on the results of an in&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57&#8201;&#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate&#8208;determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the in&#8197;situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high&#8208;quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h) is also identified.

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation</title>

Abstract
The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2&#8201;a: X=Cl, 2&#8201;b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex&#8197;1&#8201;b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;a) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5&#8201;a: X=Cl, n=2.4; 5&#8201;b: X=Br, n=2.4; 5&#8201;c: X=I, n=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5&#8201;c is found for the first time.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;X)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Cl, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and even the first &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The sandwich complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(CuX)&lt;sub&gt;20&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Cl, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2.4; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2.4; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;: X=I, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; is found for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
In recent years, luminescent materials doped with Ln3+ ions have attracted much attention for their application as optical thermometers based on both downshifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on the development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with two series of visible Ln3+ complexes (Ln3+=Tb3+, Eu3+, and Sm3+) and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA film doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ complexes was the PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1 film (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate; tppo=triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing of Sr=4.21&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K, whereas for the PMMA films doped with Tb3+ and Sm3+ complexes the best performing was the PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3 film (L2=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate), with Sr=3.64&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K. Additionally, SiO2 NPs coated with the best performing films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8211;Eu and Tb&#8211;Sm) and their temperature&#8208;sensing properties were studied in water, showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1@SiO2: Sr=3.84&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C; PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3@SiO2: Sr=3.27&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied, showing that they were nontoxic.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphism is defined as the formation of more than two kinds of crystal structures from a single compound, which is essential for practical applications such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymorphism of the helical nanofilament (HNF) is investigated by using light&#8208;driven and nanoconfinement methods. The light&#8208;driven HNFs form the twisted ribbons, while the nanoconfined HNFs show the cylindrical ribbons. The discovery of polymorphism on HNF structures will provide insights for future studies on chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;K. Yoon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005221).

         <title>Enantioselective Aromatic Amination?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The atroposelective formation of C&#8722;N bonds has recently emerged within the field of amination reactions. On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class of organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8722;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Device Fabrication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent boroles: Highly twisted donor&#8208;functionalised 9&#8208;borafluorenes have been synthesised that exhibit bright luminescence without obvious charge&#8208;transfer character, as well as excellent thermal stability, suggesting their suitability for optoelectronic applications (see figure). Two organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices fabricated with these compounds showed properties highly favourable for future development.







Abstract
A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, have been prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relatively high quantum yields (up to 73.6&#8201;% for FMesB&#8208;Cz as a neat film). The results suggest that the highly twisted donor groups suppress charge transfer, but the intrinsic photophysical properties of the 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain. The new compounds showed enhanced stability towards the atmosphere, and exhibited excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for application in materials science. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibited strong yellow&#8208;greenish electroluminescence, with a maximum luminance intensity of &gt;22&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These are the first two examples of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and they have enabled us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties while improving their stability.

&lt;p&gt;A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, have been prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relatively high quantum yields (up to 73.6&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;FMesB&#8208;Cz&lt;/b&gt; as a neat film). The results suggest that the highly twisted donor groups suppress charge transfer, but the intrinsic photophysical properties of the 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain. The new compounds showed enhanced stability towards the atmosphere, and exhibited excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for application in materials science. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibited strong yellow&#8208;greenish electroluminescence, with a maximum luminance intensity of &amp;gt;22&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These are the first two examples of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and they have enabled us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties while improving their stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the advent of electronic devices, lightweight alternatives to conventionally used semiconductors are required. Porous (metal&#8211;)organic semiconductors are intriguing alternatives to silicon and especially their structural tunability resulted in a wide variety of functional materials. Although molecular design of these semiconductors is well understood, dimensionality and its influences are seldomly evaluated. In this Minireview, the role of dimensionality in porous semiconductors is critically evaluated.







Abstract
With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties (porosity, packing, conjugation) is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this Minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the frame: The nitration of the V&#8208;shaped linker 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid by Al(NO3)3 and Ga(NO3)3 prior to crystallization of the MOF leads selectively to Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 and Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 type compounds. In situ IR spectroscopy and light scattering experiments in combination with 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy were used to study the product formation. DFT and GCMC calculations were employed to understand the differences in framework formation and water adsorption properties.







Abstract
The reaction of the V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with CAU&#8208;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type structure of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,&#8201;2,&#8201;4,&#8201;6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), whereas the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8201;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization, as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fantastic fusion: The fusion of naphthalene&#8208; as well as perylenediimides and hexabenzocoronenes via a fully conjugated benzimidazole linker enables the formation of helical as well as linear &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;hybrids applying Diels&#8211;Alder and Scholl&#8208;type chemistry. Remarkable differences in aggregation, charge&#8208;transfer (CT) stabilization as well as CT lifetimes emphasize the influence of the configuration of the bridge on donor&#8211;acceptor properties.







Abstract
Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes as precursors were accessed via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide, enabled the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics were noted for the two configurations. What stood out was their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborated the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. However, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Quadruply Bonded Dimolybdenum Complexes with Terminal and Bridging Hydride Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruply bonded dimolybdenum complexes: A variety of hydride complexes with a quadruply bonded Mo2 core are presented in his article, focusing on an unusual trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) central unit stabilized by amidinate ligands. The structure and thermodynamic stability of the different adducts have been investigated by experimental and computational techniques.







Abstract
This contribution focuses on complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (1) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(L)2] (1&#8901;thf and 1&#8901;py), which contain a trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp2)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central trans&#8208;Mo2H2 unit of 1, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &#1013;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes 1&#8901;L but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, for example, PMe3, can bind to 1, causing one of the hydrides to form a three&#8208;centered, two&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;2e) Mo&#8208;H&#8594;Mo bond (2&#8901;PMe3). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8722;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of 1&#8901;thf by silver triflimidate, AgNTf2, to afford a monohydride [Mo2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf2)(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (4), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.

&lt;p&gt;This contribution focuses on complex [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8901;thf&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;py&lt;/b&gt;), which contain a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;=HC(NDipp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;L&lt;/b&gt; but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, for example, PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can bind to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, causing one of the hydrides to form a three&#8208;centered, two&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;2e) Mo&#8208;H&#8594;Mo bond (&lt;b&gt;2&#8901;PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8722;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;thf&lt;/b&gt; by silver triflimidate, AgNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to afford a monohydride [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;&#8208;Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphogenesis control: the morphogenesis of the helical nanofilament (HNF) liquid&#8208;crystal phase was controlled to give structures that depend on the growth conditions. Two different growth methods were used to investigate the polymorphism of HNFs: nanoconfinement and light&#8208;driven orientation. This is apparently the first report on the polymorphism of an HNF phase formed by single kind of molecules.







Abstract
Herein, it is reported that the polymorphism in the helical nanofilament (HNF, B4) liquid&#8208;crystalline phase depends on the fabrication methods, that is, UV&#8208;driven formation and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometry. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures were obtained, in which generation of the twisted&#8208;ribbon and cylindrical&#8208;ribbon polymorphs showed that even the molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures were directly observed by SEM and grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. The resultant polymorphs could be used in chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability for fine control of the helical structures.

Cascade reaction: An efficient asymmetric Mannich/cyclization cascade strategy is established from 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with N&#8208;acylpyrazoles to provide optical active benzothiazolopyrimidine derivatives using a copper&#8208;based complex. The mild cascade process constructs various structurally diverse products with broad scope of substrates together with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1).

         <title>Electrochemical Tri&#8208; and Difluoromethylation&#8208;Triggered Cyclization Accompanied by the Oxidative Cleavage of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage: An unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process has been established in an undivided cell. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Considering their unique roles in organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, the development of fluoroalkylation, cyclization, and indole oxidative cleavage are important topics. Herein, an unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process occurring in an undivided cell is presented. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity. It is worth noting that this new methodology merges the fluoroalkylation/cyclization of N&#8208;substituted acrylamide alkenes with the oxidative cleavage of an indole C(2)=C(3) bond under external oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of high ET heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized with large dihedral angles enforced by steric hindrance. A meta&#8208;conjugated carbazole dimer displays the highest ET of 3.07&#8197;eV in dilute polymer film, however in a neat film this falls to 2.83&#8197;eV. Similar variation is observed across the series. This work highlights that to reliably estimate host/guest compatibility, ET determined from phosphorescence of neat films must be reported for new host materials. The currently accepted practice of reporting values from frozen solution or polymer films is no substitute.







Abstract
A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how para&#8208; vs. meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in ET of 0.24&#8197;eV in the different media&#8212;sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device&#8212;with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower ET values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high ET materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.

         <title>Fluorescence Response and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Tweezer&#8208;Type Synthetic Receptor Triggered by Complexation with Heme and Its Catabolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At a pinch: A tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor bearing sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore exhibits a significant fluorescence response upon host&#8211;guest complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;7.4. The complex acquires a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates. Fluorescence responses of the receptor to heme catabolites and other biologically relevant molecules were also evaluated.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the development and applications of synthetic receptors that recognize target biomolecules in aqueous media. We have developed a new tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor that gives a significant fluorescence response upon complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;7.4. The synthetic receptor consists of a tweezer&#8208;type heme recognition site and sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore. The receptor&#8211;heme complex exhibits a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates, and both the tweezer moiety and the sulfo&#8208;Cy5 moiety are important for this property. The synthetic receptor also exhibits significant fluorescence responses to biliverdin and bilirubin, but shows very weak fluorescence responses to flavin mononucleotide, folic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which contain smaller &#960;&#8208;scaffolds.

         <title>Approaches to the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Modified Carbohydrates and Derivatives: Thiosugars, Iminosugars, and Tetrahydro(thio)pyrans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;modified carbohydrates: New protocols for the direct incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups onto carbohydrate scaffolds that rely on thermal metal&#8208;mediated chemistry and photocatalysis are presented. Along with the introduction of fluoroalkyl moieties into carbohydrates, the fluorination and fluoroalkylation reactions of iminosugars, pyrans, and thiopyrans will be presented. Recent examples on the trifluoromethylthiolation of glycals are illustrated.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals, and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In light of these promising applications, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl RF groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they are relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of RF groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8211;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obstinate auxiliaries: How can directing groups be removed after successful C&#8722;H activation or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization? This Review discusses different strategies for 8&#8208;aminoquinoline removal to access a wide variety of products. Challenges and limitations are highlighted and alternative approaches are suggested to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide to directing group removal.







Abstract
The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N&#8208;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.

         <dc:description>
Magnesium and p&#8208;block metallocenes: The synthesis and structures of diphosphanylmetallocenes of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements are described, including the first group&#8197;15 diphosphanylmetallocene. Their application as ligands in coordination chemistry was demonstrated for different metal fragments and the reactivity of a magnesocene towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
Several 1,1&#8242;&#8208;diphosphanyl&#8208;substituted metallocenes of magnesium (magnesocenes) were synthesized, structurally characterized, and their reactivity and coordination chemistry were investigated. Transmetalation of these magnesocenes gives access to group&#8197;14 metallocenes (tetrelocenes), as well as to group 15 stibonocenes. These s&#8208; and p&#8208;block metallocenes represent a novel class of bis(phosphanyl) ligands, exhibiting Lewis&#8208;amphiphilic character. Their coordination chemistry towards different transition&#8208;metal and main&#8208;group fragments was investigated and different complexes are presented.

         <title>Accessing Lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;Lanthanide Energy Transfer in a Family of Site&#8208;Resolved [LnIIILnIII&#8242;] Heterodimetallic Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Lanthanides: A new method to prepare a large number of different heterometallic [LnLn&#8242;] dinuclear complexes is exploited for unique visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and NIR&#8208;to&#8208;NIR energy transfer (ET) within molecules, by using the [EuYb] and [NdYb] analogues, respectively. This demonstrates intramolecular sensitisation of Yb3+ by Nd3+, which acts as an ET donor.







Abstract
The ligand H3L (6&#8208;[3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propionyl]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), which exhibits two different coordination pockets, has been exploited to engender and study energy transfer (ET) in two dinuclear [LnIIILnIII&#8242;] analogues of interest, [EuYb] and [NdYb]. Their structural and physical properties have been compared with newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu], and [GdYb]) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, which have been previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between EuIII and YbIII does not occur to a significant extent, whereas emission from YbIII originates from sensitisation of the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two NdIII centres in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], in which YbIII luminescence is thus, in part, sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2&#8722; Hybrid Materials and Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailor&#8208;made polyampholyte matrix enables effective interaction of different components in light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction, in our case TiO2 nanoparticles, thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2&#8722; clusters, and Eosin&#8197;Y as photosensitizer. Altogether, high photocatalytic activity for H2 generation under visible&#8208;light irradiation was observed for well&#8208;defined hybrid materials.







Abstract
An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core&#8211;shell hybrid materials based on a TiO2 core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;(n&#8208;propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha&#8208;g&#8208;PAA@TiO2). The PDha&#8208;g&#8208;PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO2 core. This resulted in high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 generation. The enhanced light&#8208;driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core&#8211;shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha&#8208;g&#8208;PAA@TiO2 was possible by introducing [Mo3S13]2&#8722; cluster anions as hydrogen&#8208;evolution cocatalyst. This novel design approach is an example for a multi&#8208;component system in which reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.

         <title>Na6MQ4 (M=Zn, Cd; Q=S, Se): Promising New Ternary Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser damage limitation: Promising ternary infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Na6MQ4 (M=Zn, Cd; Q=S, Se), with unique [NaQ4] NLO&#8208;active groups, are successfully prepared. Theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that the second&#8208;harmonic generation effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ4 NLO&#8208;active units with a short Na&#8722;S bond length.







Abstract
Four sodium&#8208;based ternary IR nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Na6MQ4 (M=Zn, Cd; Q=S, Se), were prepared through a high&#8208;temperature flux method. The crystal structure of the compounds is built up of isolated [MQ4] tetrahedra and a 3D framework formed by the NaQn (n=4, 5) units. The two selenides, Na6MSe4 (M=Zn, Cd), as promising IR NLO materials, show moderate second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses (0.9 and 0.5&#215;AgGaS2) with good phase&#8208;matching behavior, as well as high laser damage thresholds (2 and 1.9&#215;AgGaS2). The two sulfides, Na6MS4 (M=Zn, Cd), exhibit higher laser damage thresholds (13 and 4&#215;AgGaS2), but smaller SHG responses (0.3 and 0.2&#215;AgGaS2). Theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that the SHG effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ4 NLO&#8208;active units with a short Na&#8722;S bond length, which provides a new insight into the design of novel IR NLO materials.

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go with the microflow: Methods that accomplish rapid (0.5&#8211;10&#8197;s) and mild lactamization with highly electrophilic triphosgene in a microflow reactor are described. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields (72&#8211;95&#8201;%). The developed approach enabled safe, rapid, mild, inexpensive, and less&#8208;wasteful synthesis of lactams without the need for tedious purification.







Abstract
Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated and coupling&#8208;agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less&#8208;wasteful approaches mediated by highly electrophilic reagents are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, a methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a microflow reactor that accomplishes rapid (0.5&#8211;10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less&#8208;wasteful lactamization are described. Methods&#8197;A and B, which use N&#8208;methylmorpholine and N&#8208;methylimidazole, respectively, were developed. Various lactams and a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purification. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed, and the risk of handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of microflow technology.

         <title>5&#8208;Methylcytosine Substantially Enhances the Thermal Stability of DNA Minidumbbells</title>

Stay in shape with minidumbbells: Consecutive cytosine methylations (5&#8208;methylcytosine) in DNA minidumbbells bring about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure that has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities. It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology. DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations. The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications. In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs. Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23&#8201;&#176;C. NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.

         <title>Single&#8208;Point Mutant Inverts the Stereoselectivity of a Carbonyl Reductase toward &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters with Enhanced Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching selectivity: To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of antiPrelog carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, rational enzyme design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to antiPrelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1&#8211;99.1&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of antiPrelog carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, rational enzyme design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to antiPrelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1&#8211;99.1&#8201;% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8211;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the antiPrelog&#8208;preferred conformation. In contrast, the relatively large and rigid structure of the aromatic ketones prevents them from forming the antiPrelog&#8208;preferred conformation.

&lt;p&gt;Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of antiPrelog carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, rational enzyme design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to antiPrelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1&#8211;99.1&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8211;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the antiPrelog&#8208;preferred conformation. In contrast, the relatively large and rigid structure of the aromatic ketones prevents them from forming the antiPrelog&#8208;preferred conformation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Do Docking Sites Persist Upon Fluorination? The Diadamantyl Ether&#8208;Aromatics Challenge for Rotational Spectroscopy and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of H&#8594;F substitution on the interactions and structure of complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene and a series of fluorinated benzenes have been studied using rotational spectroscopy. London dispersion is the governing factor in directing spatial arrangement. The preferred binding position changes upon partial or full substitution, whereas the overall contributions of the intermolecular interactions involved are similar.







Abstract
Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proven to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether (C20H30O) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. In this work, an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes is reported to analyze the effect of H&#8594;F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Activity of Ferrocenyl and Ruthenocenyl Analogues of Etoposide: Discovery of a Novel Dual Inhibitor of Topoisomerase II Activity and Tubulin Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal makes a difference: Ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide have been synthesized to evaluate the impact of the metallocenyl moiety on their mode of actions. Replacement of the carbohydrate moiety with the &#969;&#8208;ferrocenylalkylamino group led to significantly improved cytotoxicity toward cancer cell lines, including etoposide&#8208;resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines, and resulted in dual inhibitory activity toward TOPO II and tubulin polymerization.







Abstract
Two series of the ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide bearing 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl or aminoalkyl linker were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic properties, influence on the cell cycle, ability to induce tubulin polymerization, and inhibition of topoisomerase II activity. We found that the replacement of the etoposide carbohydrate moiety with a metallocenyl group led to organometallic conjugates exhibiting differentiated antiproliferative activity. Biological studies demonstrated that two ferrocenylalkylamino conjugates were notably more active than etoposide, with submicromolar or low&#8208;micromolar IC50 values towards SW620, etoposide&#8208;resistant SW620E, and methotrexate&#8208;resistant SW620M cancer cell lines. Moreover, the simplest ferrocenylmethylamino conjugate exerted dual inhibitory action against tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase II activity while other studied compounds affected only topoisomerase II activity.

         <title>A Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive &#945;&#8208;Desulfonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;controlled cleavage: A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized nitriles and ketones from readily&#8208;available &#945;&#8208;sulfonylated precursors. The homolytic reductive C&#8722;S cleavage occurs under the control of an in situ generated titanium(III) catalyst and it can be combined with a Michael addition reaction to achieve a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation.







Abstract
A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied also to the &#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones. In addition, a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst&#8208;dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C&#8722;S cleavage.

Skinny curves: Well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are prepared using an ammonia&#8208;based hydrothermal synthesis and a commercial solid&#8208;type black carbon as raw material. The oxygen reduction reaction activity and durability of NHCs depend on the shell thickness. The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8722;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbons have been regarded as one of the promising materials alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their high activity and stability. In this paper, well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are firstly synthesized by using an ammonia&#8208;based hydrothermal synthesis that is environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production in industry and a commercial black carbon as raw material. Moreover, the shell thickness of the NHCs can be easily tuned by this hydrothermal strategy. Zn&#8211;air battery test results reveal shell thickness&#8208;dependent activity and durability for ORR over the NHCs, which exceeds that obtained by commercial Pt/C (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8211;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface, which served as the main active sites for ORR as evidenced by DFT calculations. The proposed approach may open a way for designing curved hollow carbons with high graphitization degree and dopant nitrogen level for metal&#8211;air batteries or fuel cells.

         <title>Small Molecule Activation with Intramolecular &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs have been prepared and their ability to activate small molecules investigated.







Abstract
The intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1&#8208;BR2&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me2N)2C=N]&#8208;C6H4 (3&#8211;6) [BR2=BMes2 (3), BC12H8, (4), BBN (5), BBNO (6)] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis. These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, O&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, B&#8722;H and C=O bonds. 4 and 5 deprotonated terminal alkynes and acetylene to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR2)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me2N)2C=NH]&#8208;C6H4 (R=Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH2 and pyrrolidine, to generate the FLP adducts 1&#8208;(R2HN&#8594;BR2)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me2N)2C=NH]&#8208;C6H4, where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition, 5 was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H2CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise, 5 is capable of cleaving H2, HBPin and PhSiH3 to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novel intramolecular&lt;/b&gt; &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs have been prepared and their ability to activate small molecules investigated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1&#8208;BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=N]&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) [BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=BMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), BC&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), BBN (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), BBNO (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;)] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis. These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, O&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, B&#8722;H and C=O bonds. &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; deprotonated terminal alkynes and acetylene to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NH]&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pyrrolidine, to generate the FLP adducts 1&#8208;(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HN&#8594;BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NH]&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; is capable of cleaving H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HBPin and PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Long and Bright Path of a Lanthanide MOF: From Basics towards the Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Tb&#8208;based&#8208;MOF modified cotton for implementation into a fluoride sensor has been synthesized and characterized. The study is divided in three sections, the first one is devoted to the characterization of the MOF deposited on the cotton, the second to the structural and spectroscopic behavior of the MOF in contact with water and fluoride aqueous solutions and the third to the construction of a tech demo of a fluoride sensor.







Abstract
The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. Cotton was chosen as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity which, together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. Crystalline phase changes were identified that correlated to structural information. Finally, the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was used to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response of up to 10&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 and a limit of detection of 0.8&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Cyano &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alkanes by Light&#8208;Mediated Single Electron Transfer Between Donor&#8211;Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light and a base are all you need to couple &#945;&#8208;acidic cyanoalkanes with C1 units to form cyclopropanes. No photocatalyst, transition metal or alkene is required. Mechanistically, a photoinduced single electron transfer of a transient donor&#8211;acceptor complex is proposed to form a reactive &#946;,&#945;&#8208;radical anion of the cyanoalkane prior to &#946;&#8208;coupling with a decarboxylated C1 radical and &#945;&#8208;anionic ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one&#8208;pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing &#946;&#8208;aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (N&#8208;oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox&#8208;neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal&#8208; or organic&#8208;based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the &#945;&#8208;cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the N&#8208;oxy ester is facilitated by blue&#8208;light via their electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex. The &#945;&#8208;cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a &#946;&#8208;proton to form a &#960;&#8208;resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic &#946;&#8208;position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal&#8208;free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of cis&#8208;aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubstituted quaternary carbons.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Arylmetallative Cyclizations onto Acyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domino reactions involving nickel&#8208;catalyzed additions of (hetero)arylboronic acids to alkynes, followed by cyclization of the alkenylnickel intermediates onto tethered acyclic ketones to give chiral tertiary&#8208;alcohol&#8208;containing products in high enantioselectivities, are described. The reversible E/Z isomerization of the alkenylnickel intermediates enables overall anti&#8208;arylmetallative cyclization to occur. The ring system of the products are substructures of certain diarylindolizidine alkaloids.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid&#8208;materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO  3  ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO  3  ) nanoplates as a negative&#8208;electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive&#8208;electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous&#8208;electrolyte (1M H  2  SO  4  ) using three&#8208; and two&#8208; electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO  3  ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with an associated high energy density of 93 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg in a wide 1.6 V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO  3  ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining ~92% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO  3  nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library based on peptide macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives, based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1,254,838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.</dc:description>

Besides, ynamides  3  and 8&#8211;aryl&#8208;8&#8211;azaheptafulvenes  1  , undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles  7  in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf  2  as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents.

         <title>Probing multiconfigurational states by spectroscopy:&#160;The cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS spectra of CeO2  and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with&#160;ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed&#160;spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the&#160;relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron&#160;occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO  2  and cerocene&#160;exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction&#160;configurational&#160;composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated&#160;GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements&#160;using peak areas&#160;(nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3&#8208;edge is&#160;rationalized from the perspective&#160;of the relaxed orbitals for the GS and core ESs. The&#160;states&#160;underlying the different peaks&#160;differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1  vs. 4f0  sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene&#160;spectral peaks is associated with&#160;4f2  sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in&#160;terms of Ce IV and III ONs, as long assumed, with Ce II states additionally appearing in the&#160;cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the&#160;accuracy of the conventional&#160;approach to determining  nf  &#160;from Ce L3&#8208;edge, imitations are highlighted in terms of the&#160;ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states.&#160;The need to determine the origins of  nf  &#160;by calculations&#160;is stressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N  2  adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8208;0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH  3  production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co&#8208;C)&#8208;Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8208;hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#956;molg  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational switching through the one&#8208;electron reduction of an acridinium&#8208;based&#160;&#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8208;carbenium interaction present in these complexes.&#160; Here, we show that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9&#8208; N &#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au &#8211; Acr distance.&#160; Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O &#8211; carbenium interaction.&#160; These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.&#160; These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical&#8208;Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. We herein report extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts. We found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO energies and LUMO energies of the corresponding triazolylidene based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversiblility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR&#8208; spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type gold&#8208;MIC phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold coordinated MIC&#8208;radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics for Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational molecular design of multifunctional blue material based on phenanthroimidazole derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with EQEs over 5% are still scarce in OLEDs. In this work, by introducing the [1,2,4] triazolo [1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit to the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole, two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPBTPA were obtained. Based on systematic photophysical analysis, we found that the TP block is suitable for constructing HLCT emitters. Its moderate electron withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring the color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the increased phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increases the oscillator strength, but also shortens the stokes shift. TDDFT calculations point to facile RISC processes in PTPBTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. PTPBTPA presents impressive performances when serving as non&#8208;doped device (EQE  max  = 7.11%, CIE: (0.15, 0.09)), as well as a high&#8208;performance host for yellow and red PhOLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dye into PTPBTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85% was achieved. The successful design of PTPBTPA not only provides an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrates the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of secondary amides using phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Watson&#8208;Crick coding system depends on molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8208;Crick and purine&#8208;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative and 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased when single modified purine&#8208;purine base pairs were inserted but increased when pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8208;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8208;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8208;purine DNA tracts. Changes of the global helical structure monitored by CD spectra show the impact of functionalization to the global double helix structure. The work steps in new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs complementary in hydrogen bonding but not in size to canonical pairs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Actinide +VI complexes (An VI = U VI , Np VI and Pu VI ) with

dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by

powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In

addition, Np VI and Pu VI complexes were described by first principles

CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The

analysis of the 1 H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons

of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the

Fermi contact contribution is negligible. The magnetic susceptibility

tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217;

method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic

susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions

in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic

properties of the Np VI complex. The temperature dependence of the

pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 1 &#8260; T contribution, contrarily to

Bleaney&#8217;s theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the

magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Np VI

         <title>Carbon Origami via Alumina Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Algorithm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategy for the synthesis of pristine non&#8208;planar nanographenes (NGs) via cyclodehydrofluorination algorithm is reported and creation of highly strained systems via alumina&#8208;assisted C&#8208;F bond activation is shown. Steric hindrance could execute an alternative coupling program leading to rare octagon formation, that opens an access to the elusive non&#8208;classical NGs. The combination of two alternative ways of folding could lead to the formation of various 3D NG objects, resembling the Japanese art &#8211; origami. The power of the presented &#8220;origami&#8221; approach is proved by the assembly of 12 challenging nanographenes that are p&#8208;isoelectronic to planar hexabenzocoronene but forced out of planarity.</dc:description>
