         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Aryl Aldehydes Using Propiolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefination of aldehydes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic synthesis. The commonly used Wittig olefination reaction however uses stoichiometric quantities reagents under basic conditions resulting in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts. Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base&#8208;free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis on the Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction of Aminochalcone: Catalytic Performance and Chalcogen Bond Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non&#8208;covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono&#8208;dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB1 was comparable to that of bis&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB4, and stronger than that of mono&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB2 and ChB3. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8208;C&#8208;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction. The electron density of the chalcogen bond of the pre&#8208;complex, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8208;N bond coupling process, which provides an idea to predict the catalytic activity of the ChB catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the present study, we report a &#960;&#8208;extended conjugated molecular cleft, two zinc(II)porphyrin bearing bisstyrylBODIPY (dyad, 1) has been synthesized. The binding of 1 via a &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination of a bis&#8208;pyridyl fulleropyrrolidine (2), forming a stable self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex (1:2), has been established. The self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been fully characterized by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical methods, including TD&#8208;DFT studies. From the established energy diagram, both energy and electron transfer events was envisioned. In dyad 1, selective excitation of zinc(II)porphyrin leads to efficient singlet&#8208;singlet excitation transfer to (bisstyrly)BODIPY with an energy transfer rate constant, kEnT of 2.56 x 1012 s&#8208;1. In complex 1:2, photoexcitation of zinc(II)porphyrin results in ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer with a charge separation rate constant, kCS of 2.83 x 1011 s&#8208;1, and a charge recombination rate constant, kCR of 2.51 x 109 s&#8208;1. For excitation at 730 nm corresponding to bisstyrylBODIPY, similar results are obtained, where a biexponential with estimated values of kCS 3.44 x 1011 s&#8208;1 and 2.97 x 1010 s&#8208;1, and a kCR value of 2.10 x 1010 s&#8208;1. The newly built self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been shown to successfully mimic the early events of the photosynthetic antenna&#8208;reaction center events.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported Pt(II) complex encapsulated by intercalated water layers of L4(4)8(8) topology forms intercalato&#8208;clathrate. Its comparison to similar water&#8208;based inclusion compounds allowed to suggest parameters (e.&#8201;g. h&#8208;corrugation height; Nvol&#8208; volumetric corrugation density) characterizing the corrugation of individual layers. Intra&#8208;water energies define particular water systems as confined or confining mediums.







Abstract
Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested that these could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and the effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.

         <title>Chirality Sensing of Cryptochiral Guests with Prism[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prismarenes function as chiroptical probes for optical chirality sensing. Encapsulation of cryptochiral molecules within the cavity of prismarenes triggers ECD signals. This enables the determination of the absolute configuration of the most stable chiral host&#8208;guest complex. Additionally, the measurement of ECD band intensities facilitates the determination of the enantiomeric ratio of scalemic mixtures.







Abstract
Optical chirality sensing has gained significant attention in recent years. Within this field, the quest for stereodynamic chiroptical probes capable of detecting cryptochiral guests presents a formidable challenge. Macrocycles exhibiting planar chirality have emerged as promising candidates for amplifying the chirality of cryptochiral guests. In this study, we demonstrate that the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes between cryptochiral molecules and planar chiral prismarenes triggers electronic circular dichroism (ECD) signals via host&#8208;guest complexation&#8208;induced chirality amplification. The absolute configuration of the most stable chiral macrocyclic host&#8208;guest complex has been established by resorting to both exciton model and DFT computations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this supramolecular chirality sensing system can be employed to determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures by measuring the ECD bands intensity. The information described here opens the way for the use of prismarenes as stereodynamic probes for sensing of cryptochiral guests.

         <title>A Cu/MnOx Composite with Copper&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Oxygen Vacancies as a Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use a simple hydrothermal synthesis method to compound MnOx and Cu. Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are anticipated to be the next generation of important energy storage devices to replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the ongoing use of lithium resources and the safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Manganese&#8208;based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

Therefore, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.

         <title>Pronounced Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Anisidine Amino Acid Diamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers: Anisidine amino acid diamides show extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition making them to versatile NMR shift&#8208;reagents.







Abstract
The emergent properties resulting from selective supramolecular interactions are of significant importance for materials and chemical systems. For the directed use of such properties, a fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism and the resulting mode of function is necessary for a tailored design. The self&#8208;induced diastereomeric anisochronism effect (SIDA), which occurs in the intermolecular interaction of chiral molecules, generates unique properties such as chiral self&#8208;recognition and nonlinear effects. Here we show that anisidine amino acid diamides lead to extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition. By systematic experiments we have investigated the underlying SIDA effect, explored its limits and finally successfully utilized it in the determination of enantiomeric ratios by NMR spectroscopy of chiral &#8216;SIDA&#8208;inactive&#8217; compounds such as thalidomide.

         <title>Short Peptide and Amino Acid&#8208;Based Supramolecular Ionogels and Eutectogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are considered ideal choices for soft materials under environmental conditions. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of biological molecules, and specifically unmodified and modified peptide and amino acids, in these solvents is crucial for accelerating future research, fostering the development of innovative, bio&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
The capability of peptide and amino acid&#8208;based molecules to act as ionogelators and eutectogelators entrapping ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) forming ionogels and eutectogels has gathered attention in recent decades. The self&#8208;assembly process, primarily driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions as hydrogen bonding, remains serendipitous in nature. This review provides a comprehensive and detailed report on self&#8208;assembly of unmodified and modified amino acids and peptides in the non&#8208;conventional solvents, ILs and DESs. Understanding these processes holds great promise for the development of innovative soft&#8208;materials, and to the progress of supramolecular systems in non&#8208;conventional solvent environments.

         <title>Structural Flexibility is a Decisive Factor in FLP Dihydrogen Cleavage with Tetrahedral Lewis Acids: A Silane Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrogen activation is the paradigmatic reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). While trigonal&#8208;planar Lewis acids have been well established in this transformation, tetrahedral Lewis acids are surprisingly limited. Indeed, several cases were computed as thermodynamically and kinetically feasible but exhibit puzzling discrepancies with experimental results. In the present study, a computational investigation of the factors influencing dihydrogen activation are considered by large ensemble sampling of encounter complexes, deformation energies and the activation strain model for a silicon/nitrogen FLP and compared with a boron/phosphorous FLP. The analysis adds the previously missing dimension of Lewis acids&#8217; structural flexibility as a factor that influences preexponential terms beyond pure transition state energies. It sheds light on the origin of &#8220;overfrustration&#8221; (defined herein), indicates structural constraint in Lewis acids as a linchpin for activation of weak donor substrates, and allows drawing a more refined mechanistic picture of this emblematic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Valorization of Corn Straw for Production of Glucose by Two&#8208;step Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization of the cellulose part in lignocellulose to glucose is a significant step for lignocellulose valorization. As one of the main by&#8208;products of agricultural biomass in crop&#8208;producing filed, valorization of corn straw has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8208;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis was applied for selective depolymerization of the cellulose component of corn straw to glucose production. Most part of the hemicellulose component could be removed through high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8208;H2O pretreatment in the presence of low concentration of acetic acid, and then as high as 32.2% yield of glucose was achieved in water at 170 oC for 6 h without additional catalyst. The active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation of hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups on glucose units of cellulose was shown to be crucial for the efficient valorization of corn straw for glucose production.</dc:description>

The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yield and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol, we were able to devise a significantly improved 2nd generation total synthesis with 12 steps in the longest linear sequence and an overall total yield of 24%.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Conformation Controls Assembly of a Helicate/Mesocate, Heteroleptic [Pd2L2L&#8217;2] Cages and a Six&#8208;Jagged [Pd6L12] Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular building blocks, capable of adopting several strongly deviating conformations, are of particular interest in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemblies. The pronounced structural flexibility of a short acridone&#8208;based bridging ligand, equipped with two monodentate isoquinoline donors, is herein exploited to assemble a surprisingly diverse series of coordination&#8208;driven Pd(II) architectures. First, it can form a highly twisted Pd2L4 helicate,&#160;transformable into the corresponding mesocate, controlled by temperature, counter anion and choice of solvent. Second, it also allows the formation of heteroleptic cages, either from a mix of ligands with Pd(II) cations or by cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation from homoleptic assemblies. Here, the acridone&#8208;based ligand tolerates counter ligands that carry their donors either in a diverging or converging arrangement, as it can rotate its own coordination sites by 90&#176; and structurally adapt to both situations via shape complementarity. Third, by a near 180&#176; rotation of only one of its arms, the ligand can adopt an S&#8208;shape conformation and form an unprecedented C6h&#8208;symmetric Pd6L12 saw&#8208;toothed six&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Masking the Bioactivity of Hydroxamic Acids by Coordination to Cobalt: Towards Bioreductive Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical use of many potent anticancer agents is limited by their non&#8208;selective toxicity to healthy tissue. One of these examples is vorinostat (SAHA), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, which shows high cytotoxicity with limited discrimination for cancerous over healthy cells. In an attempt to improve tumor selectivity, we exploited the properties of cobalt(III) as a redox&#8208;active metal center through stabilization with cyclen and cyclam tetraazamacrocycles, masking the anticancer activity of SAHA and other hydroxamic acid derivatives to allow for the complex to reach the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. Biological assays demonstrated the desired low in vitro anticancer activity of the complexes, suggesting effective masking of the activity of SAHA. Once in the tumor, the bioactive moiety may be released through the reduction of the CoIII center. Investigations revealed high long&#8208;term stability of the complexes, with cyclic voltammetry and chemical reduction experiments supporting the design hypothesis of SAHA release through the reduction of the CoIII prodrug. The results highlight the potential for further developing this complex class as novel anticancer agents by masking the high cytotoxicity of a given drug, however, the cellular uptake needs to be improved.</dc:description>

         <title>The Perfluoro&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene&#8208;mercury Trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 &#8211; a Textbook Example of Phase&#8208;Dependent Structural Differences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geometric and electronic structure of [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 (1) in the gas phase, i.e. free of intermolecular interactions, was deter&#173;mined by a synchronous gas&#8208;phase electron diffraction/mass spec&#173;trometry experiment (GED/MS), complemented by quantum chemi&#173;cal calculations. 1 is stable up to 498 K and the gas phase contains a single molecular form: the trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3. It has a planar structure of D3h sym&#173;metry with a Hg&#8211;C distance of 2.075(5) &#197; and a Hg&#8211;Hg distance of 3.614(7) &#197; (both rh1). Structural differences between the crystalline and gaseous state have been analyzed. Different DFT functio&#173;nal&#8208;basis combi&#173;na&#173;tions were tested, demon&#173;stra&#173;ting the importance to consider the relativistic effects of the mercury atoms. The combi&#173;na&#173;tion PBE0/&#173;MWB(Hg),cc&#8208;pVTZ(C,F) turned out to be the most appro&#173;priate for the geometry optimization of such organomercurials. The elec&#173;tronic structure of 1, the nature of the chemical bonding in C&#8211;Hg&#8211;C fragments and the nature of the Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg inter&#173;actions have been analyzed in terms of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approaches. The influence of the nature of halogen substi&#173;tution on the structure of the molecules in the series [Hg(o&#8208;C6H4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Cl4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Br4)]3 was also analyzed.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnon Sensing of NO, NO2 and NH3 Gas Capture on CrSBr Monolayer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air pollution and greenhouse emissions are significant problems across various sectors, urging the need for advanced technologies to detect and capture harmful gases. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing attention due to their large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and reactivity. Herein, we investigate the potential of single&#8208;layer CrSBr for gas sensing and capturing by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. We explore the adsorption behaviour of different pollutant gases (H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, CO and CO2) on this 2D ferromagnet and the impact of intrinsic defects on its magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that Br vacancies enhance the adsorption of NH3, NO and NO2 and induce&#160;a selective frequency shift on the magnon dispersion. This work motivates the creation of novel magnonic gas sensing devices based on 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel flavin analogue as singular chemical component for lysosome bioimaging and inherited photosensitizer capability of the flavin core was demonstrated as a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Fine&#8208;tuning the flavin core with the incorporation of methoxy naphthyl appendage provides an&#160;appropriate&#160;chemical design, thereby offering greater photostability, selectivity, and lysosomal colocalization, along with the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature, making it suitable for lysosomal bioimaging, applications. Additionally, photosensitization capability of the flavin core with photostable nature of the synthesized analogue has shown remarkable capacity for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells making it a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal to Hydrogel Transformation in S&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;Cysteine&#8208;Containing Cyclic Dipeptides &#8208; Nanostructure Elucidation and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are crucial building blocks for a range of functional nanomaterials due to their simple chemical structure and high molecular stability. In this investigation, we synthesized a set of S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based CDPs (designated as P1&#8211;P6) and thoroughly examined their self&#8208;assembly behavior in a methanol&#8208;water solvent to elucidate the relationship between their structure and gelation properties. The hydrophobicity of the amino acids within the CDPs was gradually increased. The present study employed a comprehensive array of analytical techniques, including NMR, FT&#8208;IR, AFM, thioflavin&#8208;T, congo&#8208;red CD, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and biophysical calculations like Hirshfield Surface analysis and DFT analysis. These methods revealed that in addition to hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid side chain significantly influences the propensity of CDPs to form hydrogels. Each CDP yielded distinct nanofibrillar networks rich in &#946;&#8208;sheet structures, showcasing unique morphological features. Moreover, we explored the practical application of these CDP&#8208;based hydrogels in water purification by utilizing them to remove harmful organic dyes from contaminated water. This application underscores the potential of CDPs in addressing environmental challenges, offering a promising avenue for the future development of these materials in water treatment technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Part Per Million Levels of Cobalt&#8208;Salen Complexes in Hydrosilylation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of air&#8208;stable cobalt(&#8546;)salen complexes Co&#8208;1 to Co&#8208;4 have been synthesized and employed in the hydrosilylation of ketones. Notably, the most intricately tailored Co&#8208;3 pre&#8208;catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions. The developed catalytic hydrosilylation protocol proceeded with an unusual ppm level (5 ppm) catalyst loading of Co&#8208;3 and achieved a maximum TON of 200,000. A wide variety of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ketones encompassing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were successfully transformed into the desired silyl ethers or secondary alcohols in moderate to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene Synthesis and Carbon Capture Applications:

Mini&#8208;Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes, a class of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable potential for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and gas separation applications. The fabrication processes of MXene involve building up the MXene structure from constituent elements and the selective elimination of M&#8722;A bonds from the precursor MAX. However, considerable efforts are still required to design and develop efficient MXene&#8208;based technologies. This review article aims to briefly analyse the synthesis methods employed for MXene production, ranging from direct synthesis and conventional chemical wet etching approach to the more recent molten salt etching technique. The review highlights the advancements made in achieving precise control over the terminal groups, which is paramount for tailoring the properties of MXenes for specific applications. Furthermore, the potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications, particularly in developing advanced adsorbents, is emphasized. The in&#8208;depth examination of MXene synthesis techniques and their implications for carbon capture applications provides a solid foundation for developing and optimizing these promising materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in heterogeneous catalysis: A demonstration of a unified catalytic approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of enhancing the applications of hydrogen as an energy carrier, this research delved into the utilization of a singular hybrid catalyst capable of performing both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes for Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs). This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid catalyst, combining an organometallic pincer complex with Pd&#8208;Ru heterostructures supported on &#947;&#8208;alumina. Unlike conventional transition and noble metal nanoparticles, the use of a pincer complex offers exceptional thermal stability due to its aryl backbone, which is advantageous for various endothermic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons in LOHCs. This pioneering hybrid catalyst is a novel approach, demonstrating a proof of concept. In this study, we utilized the hybrid catalyst to investigate the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of a lower enthalpic system, specifically the cyclooctane&#8208;cyclooctene system. The dehydrogenation of cyclooctane was conducted at 443 K using tertiary butyl ethylene as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, while the hydrogenation of cyclooctene reaction catalyzed by Pd&#8208;Ru nanostructures occurred at 298 K and 1 atm H2. The results showed successful tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges were noted in terms of catalytic activity and recyclability, providing valuable insights for further refinement and optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Under the Influence of Water: Molecular Recognition of Organic Hydrophilic Molecules in Water with a Prismarene Host Driven by Hydration Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:A water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arene host can form endo&#8208;cavity complexes with hydrophilic organic substances in water by displacing frustrated water molecules from its deep cavity. Water molecules structured at both rims of the prismarene host can mediate hydrogen bonding interactions with the guest. Water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interactions were invoked here to elucidate the elevated binding affinities and selectivity of the prismarene host toward hydrophilic organic guests. We show that water at the interface of a host&#8208;guest complex can act as an extension of the host structure, facilitating the accommodation of neutral guests within the binding site. This study highlights the crucial role of water in facilitating supramolecular interactions between a deep&#8208;cavity prismarene host and organic hydrophilic guests in aqueous medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design&#160;of Highly Selective Sialyllactose&#8208;Imprinted Nanogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a facile method to prepare water&#8208;compatible molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP NGs) as synthetic antibodies against target glycans. Three different phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives were explored as monomers for the synthesis of MIP NGs targeting either &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. Starting from commercially available 3&#8208;acrylamidophenylboronic acid, also its 2&#8208;substituted isomer and the 5&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxymethyl cyclic PBA monoester derivative were initially evaluated by NMR studies. Then, a small library of MIP NGs imprinted with the &#945;2,6&#8208;linked template was synthesized and tested by mobility shift Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (msACE) to rapidly assess an affinity ranking. Finally, the best monomer o&#8208;acrylamido PBA was selected for the synthesis of polymers targeting both sialyllactoses. The resulting MIP NGs display an affinity constant &#8776; 106 M&#8208;1 and selectivity towards imprinted glycans. This general procedure could be applied to any non&#8208;modified carbohydrate template possessing a reducing end.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic in&#8208;situ Labelling of Gelatin Polymer in Aqueous Solution and Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gelatin polymers made from partially degraded collagen are important biomaterials, but their in&#8208;situ analysis suffers from uncontrollable covalent labelling and poor spatio&#8208;temporal imaging resolution. Herein, three tetrazolate&#8208;tagged tetraphenylethylene fluorophores (TPE&#8208;TAs) are introduced for practical fluorogenic labelling of gelatin in aqueous phase and hydrogels. These probes with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics offer negligible background and elicit turn&#8208;on fluorescence by simply mixing with the gelatin in aqueous phase, giving a detection limit of 0.15 mg/L over a linear dynamic range up to 100 mg/L. This method does not work for collagens and causes minimal interference with gelatin properties. Mechanistic studies reveal a key role for multivalent electrostatic interactions between the abundant basic residues in gelatin (e.g., lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine) and anionic tetrazolate moieties of the lipophilic fluorophore synergistically in spatially rigid macromolecular encapsulation to achieve fluorogenic labelling. The AIE strategy by forming non&#8208;covalent fluorophore&#8208;gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatio&#8208;temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in&#8208;situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin&#8208;based biomaterials during processes such as in vivo degradation and mineralization.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of skin cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50 &lt; 10 &#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.</dc:description>

Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Stable P&#8208;Chiral Supramolecular Phosphines, their Self&#8208;Assembly and Implication in Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one&#8208;step synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd&#8208;2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd&#8208;2 catalyzed a direct P&#8208;C coupling of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;iodophenyl)urea/2&#8208;iodo (B1)/6&#8208;hydroxy pyridine (B2) and, produced corresponding ligands L1&#8208;L3. The P&#8208;C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phosphindol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150 &#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24 hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self&#8208;assembled and produced L2&#8208;C1 (Pt), L2&#8208;C2(Pd), and L2&#8208;C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self&#8208;assembled P&#8208;chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2&#8208;C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of &gt;99%. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2&#8208;C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.</dc:description>

The bending of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;Bis(pyridinium&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethene dinitrate crystals induced by light and stress has been demonstrated.







Abstract
We report on the elastic and photodynamic properties of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethene dinitrate [H2Ebpe](NO3)2, whose needle&#8208;like crystals can be reversibly deformed by applying external mechanical stress. The macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties of [H2Ebpe](NO3)2 crystals were quantified by a three&#8208;point bending test, which gave a stress&#8208;strain curve with an elastic modulus of 1.18&#8197;GPa, and its values are lower than those of other flexible elastic organic crystals. It can also be reversibly bent through the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the olefin moiety, depending on the direction of UV irradiation.

Abstract
Two new chiral 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic oligoamides (i.&#8201;e.: triazolopeptoid 4 and 5) were obtained through solid&#8208;phase synthesis of linear precursors followed by high dilution macrocyclization reaction. Theoretical (DFT) and spectroscopic (NMR) studies revealed the intricate interplay between the N&#945;&#8208;chiral side chains and their conformational attitudes. BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of the tertiary amide groups of known 1&#8211;3 and newly synthesized 4 gave novel azamacrocycles 6&#8211;9. Detection of borane complexes of azamacrocycles 6 and 9 (i.&#8201;e.: 10 and 11), corroborated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, demonstrated the peculiar properties of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrorings.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylenes: Monomeric Silanechalcogenones, Silanimines, Silirenes, and Insertion Products with P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of two ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes towards small to moderately sized molecular substrates (P4, S8, Se8, organic azides and alkynes) is studied. The aryl&#8208;substituted congener is more reactive than the sterically more encumbered and less ambiphilic 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl homologue. Monomeric silanechalcogenones, silanimines and silirenes are readily available from both silylenes.







Abstract
The stable ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes fc[(N{B})2Si] (A; fc=1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene, {B}=(HCNDipp)2B, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and fc[(NDipp)2Si] (B) are compared in a study focussing on their reactivity towards a range of small to moderately sized molecular substrates, viz. P4, S8, Se8, MesN3 (Mes=mesityl), RC&#8801;CH, and RC&#8801;CR (R=Ph, SiMe3). The Dipp&#8208;substituted congener B exhibits a more pronounced ambiphilicity and is sterically less congested than its 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl&#8208;substituted relative A, in line with the higher reactivity of the former. The difference in reactivity is obviously due more to electronic than to steric reasons, as is illustrated by the fact that both A and B react with the comparatively bulky substrate MesN3 under mild conditions to afford the corresponding silanimine fc[(N{B})2Si=NMes] and fc[(NDipp)2Si=NMes], respectively. The heavier ketone analogues fc[(N{B})2Si=E] (E=S, Se, Te) are readily available from A and the corresponding chalcogen. In contrast, the reaction of the more reactive silylene B with elemental sulfur or selenium is unspecific, affording product mixtures. However, fc[(NDipp)2Si=Se] is selectively prepared from B and (Et2N)3PSe; the Te analogue is also accessible, but crystallises as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stable ferrocene-based &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic silylenes fc[(N{B})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;; fc=1,1&#8217;-ferrocenylene, {B}=(HCNDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B, Dipp=2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and fc[(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si] (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) are compared in a study focussing on their reactivity towards a range of small to moderately sized molecular substrates, viz. P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, MesN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Mes=mesityl), RC&#8801;CH, and RC&#8801;CR (R=Ph, SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The Dipp-substituted congener &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a more pronounced ambiphilicity and is sterically less congested than its 1,3,2-diazaborolyl-substituted relative &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;, in line with the higher reactivity of the former. The difference in reactivity is obviously due more to electronic than to steric reasons, as is illustrated by the fact that both &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; react with the comparatively bulky substrate MesN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions to afford the corresponding silanimine fc[(N{B})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=NMes] and fc[(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=NMes], respectively. The heavier ketone analogues fc[(N{B})&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=E] (E=S, Se, Te) are readily available from &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and the corresponding chalcogen. In contrast, the reaction of the more reactive silylene &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; with elemental sulfur or selenium is unspecific, affording product mixtures. However, fc[(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si=Se] is selectively prepared from &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; and (Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PSe; the Te analogue is also accessible, but crystallises as head-to-tail dimer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>sAPP&#945; Peptide Promotes Damaged Microglia to Clear Alzheimer's Amyloid&#8208;&#946; via Restoring Mitochondrial Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's an important challenge to find new ways to clear Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) from the brain. Soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;), an extracellular fragment peptide by the normal metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is similar to antibodies and promotes and protects microglia in phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; through normalizing mitochondrial function. sAPP&#945; is a potential therapeutic peptide drug or drug carrier for Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age&#8208;related neurodegenerative disease with amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) deposition as the main pathological feature. It's an important challenge to find new ways to clear A&#946; from the brain. The soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;) is a neuroprotective protein and can attenuate neuronal damage, including toxic A&#946;. However, the regulatory role of sAPP&#945; in non&#8208;neuronal cells, such as microglia, is less reported and controversial. Here, we showed that sAPP&#945; promoted the phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; in both normal and damaged microglia. Moreover, the function of damaged microglia was improved by the sAPP&#945; through normalizing mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the results of molecular docking simulation showed that sAPP&#945; had a good affinity with A&#946;. We preliminarily reveal that sAPP&#945; is similar to antibodies and can participate in the regulation of microglia phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; after binding to A&#946;. sAPP&#945; is expected to be a mild and safe peptide drug or drug carrier for AD.

         <title>A Phosphanyl Phosphagermene and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of a nucleophilic germylene Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 with the phosphanyl phosphaketene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]PCO induces decarbonylation to form a phosphanyl phosphagermene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]P=Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 (1; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;phenyl). Addition of CO2 or MeCN to 1 results in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions to afford five&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mode of reactivity is reminiscent of that observed for frustrated Lewis pairs, with the pendant phosphanyl group acting as a base and the germanium center as a Lewis acid. Contrastingly, 1,2&#8208;addition across the P=Ge bond was observed when using ammonia, small primary amines (NH2nPr, NH2iPr), or metal complexes (e.g. Au(PPh3)Cl and ZnEt2). These latter reactions allow for the one&#8208;step synthesis of metal phosphide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Helicene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis of heterochiral heptahelicene oligomers via Ullman coupling has been reported. Annealing helicene monomers equipped with spacer linkers and Br ligands on an Au(111) surface in UHV conditions resulted in helicene oligomers with a 100&#8201;% monomer coupling yield. The oligomers were characterized by AFM/STM and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
We report on&#8208;surface synthesis of heterochiral 1D heptahelicene oligomers after deposition of a racemic heptahelicene monomer on an Au(111) surface followed by Ullmann coupling under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Structure, chirality and mode of adsorption of the resulting dimers to octamers are inferred from the scanning probe microscopy and theoretical calculations.

Non&#8211;helical &#8220;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8221; as a novel chiral structure and single&#8211;handed helical conformation as one of the well&#8211;known, ordered chiral structures are induced to poly (naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) by circularly polarized light irradiation and asymmetric polymerization, respectively. The former conformation is stable only in the solid state while the latter resists racemization by aggregation in solution. Both conformations contribute to efficient circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Optically active poly(naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) was prepared through helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization of the corresponding monomers and also through circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation, resulting in distinctive circular dichroism (CD) spectral patterns. Chirality of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization &#8208;based polymer is ascribed to preferred&#8211;handed helicity while that of the CPL&#8211;based polymer to a non&#8211;helical, chiral conformation (&#8216;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8217;) with preferred&#8211;handedness which was stable only in the solid state. The helix of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8211;based polymer gradually racemized in tetrahydrofuran while it was stabilized by aggregate formation in a hexane&#8211;dichloromethane solution. Both helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8208; and CPL&#8211;based polymers exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thiolate&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid Catalysts for Reduction of CO2: Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Amines to Form N&#8208;Formamides and N&#8208;Methylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid is a novel type of catalyst that utilizes sulfur as the active center in an ionic liquid. It exhibits diverse functionalities in activating hydrogenated silane and amine, leading to ultra&#8208;high catalytic activity in the reductive functionalization of CO2 with amines and hydrosilane. By controlling the CO2 pressure, it enables selective synthesis of varied formamides and methylamines with high yields.







Abstract
Developing efficient catalysts to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is valuable for reducing carbon emissions. Herein, a kind of novel thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid with sulfur as the active site was designed and synthesized, which served as highly efficient catalyst for the reductive N&#8208;functionalization of CO2 by amines and hydrosilane. By adjusting the CO2 pressure, various N&#8208;formamides and N&#8208;methylamines were selectively obtained in high yields. Remarkably, at the catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol %, the N&#8208;formylation reaction of N&#8208;methylaniline exhibited an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) up to 600&#8197;h&#8722;1, which could be attributed to the roles of the ionic liquids in activating hydrosilane and amine. In addition, control experiments and NMR monitoring experiments provided evidence that the reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane yielded formoxysilane intermediates that subsequently reacted with amines to form N&#8208;formylated products. Alternatively, the formoxysilane intermediates could further react with hydrosilane and amine to produce 4&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced aminal products. These aminal products served as crucial intermediates in the N&#8208;methylation reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Thiolate-based ionic liquid is a novel type of catalyst that utilizes sulfur as the active center in an ionic liquid. It exhibits diverse functionalities in activating hydrogenated silane and amine, leading to ultra-high catalytic activity in the reductive functionalization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with amines and hydrosilane. By controlling the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, it enables selective synthesis of varied formamides and methylamines with high yields.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
In this study the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are presented. The metal complexes primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, causing cell death by apoptosis. The lead compound demonstrated to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid upon treatment with micromolar concentrations.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.

         <title>Extended Reichardt's Dye&#8211;Synthesis and Solvatochromic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new pyridinium phenolate dyes with phenylene &#960;&#8208;extension were synthesised and all exhibited strong negative solvatochromism similar to the well&#8208;known Betaine 30 dye. This contrasts with the &#960;&#8208;extended Betaine 21 previously reported to show poor solvatochromism. We found Betaine 21 to be significantly more solvatochromic than reported, with its alleged insensitivity attributed to degradation in certain solvents.







Abstract
Three new pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes based on the benchmark solvatochromic dye Betaine 30 were synthesised. The dyes contained phenylene spacers between the donor and acceptor groups. Their UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra were measured, with the dyes showing strong negative solvatochromic behaviour comparable to that of Betaine 30. These results stood in contrast to the behaviour of the &#960;&#8208;extended dye Betaine 21, originally reported in 1963. This dye was synthesised and found to be significantly more solvatochromic than previously reported but prone to degrade. All &#960;&#8208;extended dyes synthesised were found to be unstable in certain solvents. Although the increased distance between donor and acceptor did not enhance solvatochromism to the extent predicted, it was still determined that the reduced planarity caused by a phenylene spacer is not as detrimental as believed.

         <title>64Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional chelators based on bispidine picolinates allow rapid and efficient labeling with the positron emitter Cu&#8208;64 under mild conditions. The resulting 64CuII&#8208;labeled bispidine complexes exhibit high in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo stability. Isothiocyanate functionalization of bispidine picolinates in C9 position enables efficient coupling to targeting vector molecules. After 64CuII&#8208;labeling of target modules, tumor visualization by PET with high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio is obtained.







Abstract
Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis&#8208;pyridine derivative, which are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities &gt;200&#8197;MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum and SOD demonstrate high stability and inertness of the 64Cu&#8208;bispidine complexes. Biodistribution studies performed in Wistar rats indicate a rapid renal elimination for both 64Cu&#8208;labeled chelates. The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl&#8208;NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS&#8208;functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor&#8208;bearing mice showed specific accumulation of the 64Cu&#8208;labeled TMs in PSCA&#8208; and FAP&#8208;overexpressing tumors (standardized uptake value (SUV) for PC3: 2.7&#177;0.6 and HT1080: 7.2&#177;1.25) with almost no uptake in wild type tumors.

         <title>Construction of Supramolecular Polymers and Covalent Polymers via the Same Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of monomers were designed, which embodied diazonium salt units and phenolic hydroxyl groups respectively. First, supramolecular polymers were prepared driven by hydrogen bonds between diazonium salt and hydroxyl. Besides, covalent polymers could be obtained upon ultraviolet irradiation followed by the self&#8208;assembly process. In this way, both supramolecular polymers and covalent polymers were successfully synthesized using same monomers.







Abstract
Nature owns the ability to construct structurally different polymers from the same monomers. While polymers can be classified as covalent polymers (CPs) and supramolecular polymers (SPs), it is still difficult to synthesize CPs and SPs using same monomers like nature do. Herein, M1 with two diazo salts on both the ends was designed. Additionally, hydroquinone was chosen to be M2 for the existence of two hydroxyl groups. When mixing at room temperature, M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled to SPs via N&#8230;H hydrogen bonds. In another way, upon the exposure to ultraviolet irradiation when blending M1 with M2, CPs were fabricated in the presence of covalent bonds. The excellent thermal stability of CPs was determined by TGA and DSC, while the great corrosion resistance of covalent polymers was detected by acid or alkali immersion. In this way, constructing two kinds of polymers using the same monomers was successfully achieved. This shows tremendous potential in fields of polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, which would boom the development of polymers.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and Synthesis of Lipid A Derivatives to Modulate Cytokine Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>

Based on co&#8208;crystal structure of LPS with TLR4&#8208;MD2, a range of bis&#8208; and monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives was designed and synthesized to probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of the proximal glucosamine for inducing the production of a wide variety of cytokines by human monocytes.







Abstract
Agonists of Toll like receptors (TLRs) have attracted interest as adjuvants and immune modulators. A crystal structure of TLR4/MD2 with E. coli LPS indicates that the fatty acid at C&#8208;2 of the lipid A component of LPS induces dimerization of two TLR4&#8208;MD2 complexes, which in turn initiates cell signaling leading to the production of (pro)inflammatory cytokines. To probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of lipid A, a range of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;phosphoryl lipid A derivatives with different modifications at C&#8208;2 were prepared by a strategy in which 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl ethers were employed as permanent protecting group that could be readily removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The C&#8208;2 amine was protected as 9&#8208;fluorenylmethyloxycarbamate, which at a later stage could be removed to give a free amine that was modified by different fatty acids. LPS and the synthetic lipid As induced the same cytokines, however, large differences in activity were observed. A compound having a hexanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 still showed agonistic properties, but further shortening to a butanoyl abolished activity. The modifications had a larger influence on monophosphoryl lipid As. The lipid As having a butanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 could selectively antagonize TRIF associated cytokines induced by LPS or lipid A.

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To produce the key chiral intermediate of Rivastigmine, directed evolution was employed to enhance the specific activity of an alcohol dehydrogenase by over 100&#8208;fold under optimal conditions. Co&#8208;immobilization of this alcohol dehydrogenase with glucose dehydrogenase on magnetic nanoparticles yields easily recyclable biocatalysts. The biocatalytic reduction was combined with further chemical steps to achieve the chemoenzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%, demonstrating the synthesis of this important drug in an environmentally friendly and inexpensive manner.







Abstract
Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions with para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) dramatically enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. We explore the possibilities of a ligand new to this field, pyridylpyrrolides. These complexes display highly reversible hydrogen activation and repeatable hyperpolarisation in a variety of solvents, without the reduction of alkene ligands. Ligand functional group modifications reveal an untapped potential chemical scope for the development of hyperpolarisation catalysts.







Abstract
Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Synthesis of Cobalt Polynitrides: Unveiling Intriguing Crystal Structures and Nitridation Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridation behaviour of cobalt nitride unfolds along a progressive path under high&#8208;pressure conditions, as investigated using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, combined with synchrotron XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and density funtional theory. Our observations reveal a sequence of CoN6 octahedral framework transformations, including face&#8208;sharing (in CoN), edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and isolated (in CoN5) polyhedra. These changes align with the polymerization of nitrogen within the crystal.







Abstract
In this study, we conduct extensive high&#8208;pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt&#8208;nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, first&#8208;principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high&#8208;pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs&#8208;type CoN, and marcasite&#8208;type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50&#8211;90&#8197;GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma&#8208;CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90&#8211;120&#8197;GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched&#8208;type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show &#960;&#8208;bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face&#8208;sharing (in CoN) to edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high&#8208;pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials

&lt;p&gt;The nitridation behaviour of cobalt nitride unfolds along a progressive path under high-pressure conditions, as investigated using a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, combined with synchrotron XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and density funtional theory. Our observations reveal a sequence of CoN&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral framework transformations, including face-sharing (in CoN), edge-sharing (in CoN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CoN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and isolated (in CoN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) polyhedra. These changes align with the polymerization of nitrogen within the crystal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we conduct extensive high-pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt-nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, first-principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high-pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs-type CoN, and marcasite-type CoN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within the pressure range of 50&#8211;90&#8197;GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pnma&lt;/i&gt;-CoN and two polynitrides, CoN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CoN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, within the pressure range of 90&#8211;120&#8197;GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; feature branched-type nitrogen trimers (N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and CoN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; show &#960;-bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; polyhedral frameworks transit from face-sharing (in CoN) to edge-sharing (in CoN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CoN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and finally to isolated (in CoN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high-pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bright chemogenetic reporters based on the HaloTag technology with green to red emission range were obtained by combining the molecular engineering of chemically&#8208;accessible fluorescent molecular rotors with mutations of the HaloTag protein. The reporters are suitable for wash&#8208;free live cell imaging with good contrast and the design strategy facilitates the future diversification and optimization of the properties.







Abstract
The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.

         <title>Coordination of a Phosphine&#8208;Tethered Aminoborane to Group 10 Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and coordination chemistry of a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand to group 10 metals is reported, affording a rare aminoborane &#960;&#8208;complex of Ni(0). The bonding situation is best described as a 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron bond where the Ni and N atoms compete for an accepting orbital on boron. In contrast with isoelectronic olefin &#960;&#8208;complexes, the metal&#8208;ligand bond is tenuous and the B=N ligand is therefore easily displaced.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;complexes of C=C bonds are ubiquitous in organometallic chemistry, analogous complexes of the isoelectronic but strongly polarized B=N double bond of aminoboranes are extremely scarce. To address this gap, a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand (PhDPBAiPr) is introduced and its coordination with group 10 metals is investigated. The B=N bond does not coordinate to the metal in Pt(0) and Pd(II) complexes. In contrast, side&#8208;on coordination of the B=N bond is observed in the Ni(0) complex (PhDPBAiPr)Ni(NCPh), and the X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals B&#8722;N bond elongation compared to the free ligand. The choice of co&#8208;ligand strongly influences the presence or absence of side&#8208;on coordination at Ni(0) as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. While the B=N &#960;&#8208;complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron&#8208;rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.

         <dc:description>
Zn2SnS4 nanoflowers with high uniformity and a large surface area were synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method without the use of any template precursors. Utilizing macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP&#8208;1 cells as a representative sensing model, an electrochemical sensor based on the Zn2SnS4 nanoflowers was successfully fabricated for real&#8208;time monitoring of H2O2 release from living cells induced by LPS.







Abstract
The sensitive and reliable nanozyme&#8208;based sensor enables the detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments, it has potential applications as an in&#8208;situ monitoring platform for cellular H2O2 release. The uniformly dispersed bimetallic sulfide (Zn2SnS4) nanoflowers were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and the two kinds of metal ions can serve as morphology and structure directing agents for each other in the synthetic process. The nanoparticles were utilized as nanozyme materials to fabricate a novel electrochemical sensor, and it exhibits a distinct electrochemical response towards H2O2 with excellent stability and detection capability (with a minimum detection limit of 1.79&#8197;nM (S/N=3)), the excellent characteristics facilitate the precise detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments.

         <title>Elucidation of Design Criteria for V&#8208;based Redox Mediators: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships that Dictate Rates of Heterogeneous Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure function relationships of vanadium oxide complexes (V1=[V(acac)3]; V6=[V6O7(OMe)12] or [V6O13(TRISNO2)2]&#8722;3; V18=V18O46(NO3)]&#8722;5) in acetonitrile that dictate heterogeneous rate constants. Elucidation of design criteria for redox mediators.







Abstract
Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)3], [V6O7(OMe)12], [nBu4N]3[V6O13(TRISNO2)2], and [nBu4N]5[V18O46(NO3)] in non&#8208;aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1)&#8197;nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2)&#8197;distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium&#8208;based compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Structure function relationships of vanadium oxide complexes (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=[V(acac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]; V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;=[V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] or [V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;(TRIS&lt;sup&gt;NO2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;; V&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt;) in acetonitrile that dictate heterogeneous rate constants. Elucidation of design criteria for redox mediators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], [V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;], [&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;(TRIS&lt;sup&gt;NO2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], and [&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[V&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] in non-aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure-function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1)&#8197;nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2)&#8197;distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium-based compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>

D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes with thioether linkers exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The peculiar excitation dynamics responsible for the inversion was revealed; the pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures.







Abstract
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.

         <title>Polymorphism Dependent Cytotoxicity, Cellular Uptake, and Live Cell Imaging Studies on Napthalimide&#8208;Vinyl&#8208;Phenothiazine Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphs serve as excellent models for illustrating the relationship between structure and properties, given their distinction lies primarily in the arrangement of constituents within a 3D lattice. While numerous researchers leverage this concept to elucidate the influence of molecular structure on chemical and physical properties, there remains a dearth of exploration into their biological response. This study presents two luminescent polymorphs, 1Y and 1R, identified as ideal candidates for observing polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using straightforward fluorescence microscopy techniques.







Abstract
Polymorphism&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of drug molecules have been studied for the past two decades. However, the visualization of polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using microscopy imaging techniques has not yet been reported. The luminescent polymorph is an ideal candidate to validate the above hypothesis. Herein, we report the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and bio&#8208;imaging functions of polymorphs 1Y and 1R of a naphthalimide&#8208;phenothiazine dyad. These polymorphs show different luminescence colors in the solid state and exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the DMSO&#8208;Water mixture. Bioimaging, cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) studies revealed that these polymorphs show different levels of cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, localization, and imaging potential. Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Aryl Halides and Aryl Alkynes Catalyzed by an Odd Alternant Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;reduced odd alternant hydrocarbon based on phenalenyl unit acts as a catalyst for cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and aryl alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. This protocol was extended to accomplish the Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes is considered an extremely important organic transformation (popularly known as the Sonogashira coupling) and it requires a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst. Accomplishing such transformation without any transition metal&#8208;based catalyst in the absence of any external stimuli such as heat, photoexcitation or cathodic current is highly challenging. This work reports transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. A chemically double&#8208;reduced phenalenyl (PLY)&#8208;based molecule with the super&#8208;reducing property was employed for single electron transfer to activate aryl halides generating reactive aryl radicals, which subsequently react with alkyne. This protocol covers not only various types of aryl, heteroaryl and polyaryl halides but also applies to a large variety of aromatic alkynes at room temperature. With a versatile substrate scope successfully tested on more than 75 entries, this radical&#8208;mediated pathway has been explained by several control experiments. All the key reactive intermediates have been characterized with spectroscopic evidence. Detailed DFT calculations have been instrumental in portraying the mechanistic pathway. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic strategy for the first time towards solvent&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between solid aryl halide and alkyne substrates.

The chiral and amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 exhibits kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways toward three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct nanomorphologies and chiroptical properties. Temporal control of the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C leads to aggregate mixtures consisting of different ratios of Agg. B and Agg. C that show wavelength&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788&#8211;805&#8197;nm and g&#8208;factors between &#8722;4.2&#215;10&#8722;2 and &#8722;5.1&#215;10&#8722;2.

This dye exhibited kinetic-controlled self-assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (9/1, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) mixed solvent. The (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off-pathway species &lt;b&gt;Agg. A&lt;/b&gt;, which was spontaneously transformed into an on-pathway metastable aggregate (&lt;b&gt;Agg. B&lt;/b&gt;) and subsequently into the thermodynamic &lt;b&gt;Agg. C&lt;/b&gt;. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J-aggregation characteristics were observed for both &lt;b&gt;Agg. B&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Agg. C&lt;/b&gt;, such as Davydov-split absorption bands (&lt;b&gt;Agg. B&lt;/b&gt;), extremely sharp and intense J-band with large bathochromic shift (&lt;b&gt;Agg. C&lt;/b&gt;), non-diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that &lt;b&gt;Agg. A&lt;/b&gt; had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod-like helical nanostructures with left-handedness were observed respectively for &lt;b&gt;Agg. B&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Agg. C&lt;/b&gt;. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from &lt;b&gt;Agg. B&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;Agg. C&lt;/b&gt;, thin films consisting of &lt;b&gt;Agg. B&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Agg. C&lt;/b&gt; with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788&#8211;805&#8197;nm and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-factors between &#8722;4.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8722;5.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly.







Abstract
Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;&#8208;holes as halogen&#8208;bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side&#8208;arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self&#8208;aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod&#8208;like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8722;H Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of several types of tertiary amines with alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium(III) alkyl complexes. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates enabled to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines.







Abstract
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.

         <title>Influence of Lattice Defects on Trans&#8208;Oligoene Substructure Formation in Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Statistical Raman spectroscopy of iodinated graphene reveals a clear correlation between trans&#8208;oligoene substructure&#8208;Raman modes and the number of defects that indicates strong interaction within the graphene lattice. An upper limit of chain length of ~1&#8197;nm was thus determined for substructures probed at 532&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The photochemical reaction of iodine and graphene induces strong new Raman modes due to the formation of trans&#8208;oligoene substructures in graphene domains. This unique reactivity was demonstrated before on defect&#8208;free graphene, however leaving the influence of e.&#8201;g. carbon vacancies, unexplored. Here, we investigate the photochemical reaction applied on graphene with varying average distances of lattice defects and statistically analyze the characteristic Raman modes which develop with the iodination reaction. We show that the iodination reaction does not lead to Raman&#8208;active defects and thus, the newly formed trans&#8208;oligoene substructures do not contribute to the D&#8208;mode of graphene. A statistical analysis reveals the correlation between the average distance of lattice defects and the intensity of the v1&#8208;mode. For defective graphene with average defect distances below ~1&#8197;nm no new Raman modes evolve, which is the lower limit of the substructure size probed at 532&#8197;nm and explains why this observation was not possible before using common graphene oxide as graphene source.

Organocatalysis opens up for a novel cascade reaction concept where 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines first undergo an enantioselective [6+4] cycloaddition with trienamines, followed by a spontaneously series of reactions to provide chiral hexahydraoazulenes, of which some show bioactivity.







Abstract
A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8722;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), up to 96&#8201;% ee, and yields up to 52&#8201;%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.

A panel of twenty&#8208;two isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm prepared by a chemoenzymatic strategy reveals that glycan complexity can modulate receptor specificities of hemagglutinins of H5 influenza A viruses.







Abstract
Sialyl&#8208;Lewisx (SLex) is involved in immune regulation, human fertilization, cancer, and bacterial and viral diseases. The influence of the complex glycan structures, which can present SLex epitopes, on binding is largely unknown. We report here a chemoenzymatic strategy for the preparation of a panel of twenty&#8208;two isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm that include putative high&#8208;affinity ligands for E&#8208;selectin. The N&#8208;glycans were prepared starting from a sialoglycopeptide isolated from egg yolk powder and took advantage of inherent substrate preferences of glycosyltransferases and the use of 5&#8242;&#8208;diphospho&#8208;N&#8208;trifluoracetylglucosamine (UDP&#8208;GlcNHTFA) that can be transferred by branching N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferases to give, after base treatment, GlcNH2&#8208;containing glycans that temporarily disable an antenna from enzymatic modification. Glycan microarray binding studies showed that E&#8208;selectin bound equally well to linear glycans and tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex. On the other hand, it was found that hemagglutinins (HA) of H5 influenza A viruses (IAV) preferentially bound the tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans. Furthermore, several H5 HAs preferentially bound to N&#8208;glycan presenting SLex on the MGAT4 arm. SLex is displayed in the respiratory tract of several avian species, demonstrating the relevance of investigating the binding of, among others IAVs, to complex N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex.

Abstract
Understanding diversity is the foundation for progress on inclusion. Diversity covers a wide range of characteristics, not just gender. Does the training meet the current needs of the workplace? What role does gender discrimination play in the chemical workforce? To what extent are partners treated equally when caring for a family member? Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1 &#8211; ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The online questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. 9747 responses were collected for all three surveys together. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.[1,2] The questionnaires from ESEC1 to ESEC3 were continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies, for example diversity, which was specifically addressed in ESEC3. The results are reported here. The Royal Society of Chemistry asked similar questions.[3] Graduates from the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They are the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, the current report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.

Abstract
What are the country&#8208;specific differences in the education of chemistry students across the EU? How do students&#8217; preferred careers change with the level of their qualifications? Do students have sufficient information to make good career choices? Which media are now considered most effective for job searches? What do students currently consider to be a successful career?
Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1&#8722;ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The web&#8208;based questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. A total of 9747 responses were received. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.[1,2] Subsequent questionnaires have been continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies. In particular, ESEC3 focused on students&#8217; careers. The results are reported here. Where results from earlier surveys are included, this is explicitly stated.
Graduates of the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They represent the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, this report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.

         <title>Cover Feature: High&#8208;pressure Synthesis of Cobalt Polynitrides: Unveiling Intriguing Crystal Structures and Nitridation Behavior (Chem. Eur. J. 32/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cobalt polynitrides has been discovered by using laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells under high pressure that demonstrate an increasing degree of nitrogen polymerization with increasing pressure. Synthesis under high pressure and high temperature, coupled with single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;Raman imaging spectroscopy, offers significant advantages in elucidating the crystal structures of these nitrides along with the prospect of recovering of these materials under ambient conditions. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Chen, A.&#8197;F. Goncharov, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400536).

         <title>Cover Feature: 64Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates (Chem. Eur. J. 32/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispidine picolinates quickly form very stable complexes with the positron emitter 64CuII under physiological conditions. These bifunctional chelators can be easily attached to amino&#8208;terminated tumor&#8208;seeking target modules. The subsequent 64Cu labeling is fast and efficient, and does not require demanding purification steps. These compounds have great potential for the development of copper&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kubeil, P. Comba, H. Stephan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400366).

         <title>Regulation Strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction performance. Regulation strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C or Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts are summarized in this Review from 5 perspectives: (1)&#8197;coordinated atoms, (2)&#8197;environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3)&#8197;dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4)&#8197;metal&#8208;based particle promoters, and (5)&#8197;curved carbon layers.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have received great attention as energy devices of the next generation. Accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is the key to improve PEMFC and AEMFC performance. Platinum&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for the ORR, but their high price and low abundance limit the commercialization of fuel cells. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) is considered to be the most likely material class to replace Pt&#8208;based catalysts, among which Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic ORR performance and have made great progress in the past decades. With the improvement of synthesis technology and a deeper understanding of the ORR mechanism, some reported Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts have shown excellent ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Inspired by the progress, regulation strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts are summarized in this Review from 5&#8197;perspectives: (1)&#8197;coordinated atoms, (2)&#8197;environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3)&#8197;dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4)&#8197;metal&#8208;based particle promoters, and (5)&#8197;curved carbon layers. We also make suggestions on some challenges facing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C research.

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Spectroscopic Methods: Towards Chemical Sensor Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) have significant promise as chemical sensors for the differentiation of chiral analytes due to their highly tuneable nature. This review discusses the spectroscopic methods used for chiroptical sensing including photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance. Future directions are highlighted with a view towards the incorporation of CMOFs into chemical sensor devices.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.

Interfacial Engineering: As perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs) strive for higher efficiency, optimizing device performance solely through perovskite material enhancements becomes more challenging. Interfacial layers and device architecture are now recognized as crucial for stability and efficiency, playing vital roles in PeLED development. This perspective highlights advancements in PeLED devices, focusing on modifying adjacent layers interfacing with the perovskite film.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have gained significant attention due to their promising optoelectronic properties and potential applications in the fields of lighting and display devices. Despite their potential, PeLEDs face challenges related to stability, high turn&#8208;on voltage, and low external quantum efficiency (EQE) which has restricted their broad acceptance. Most research efforts have predominantly focused on refining the properties of the perovskite films. However, it is becoming more apparent that interfacial layers and device architecture are crucial for achieving stability and high efficiency, making them indispensable components in PeLED development. This perspective highlights remarkable advancements in PeLED devices, with a primary focus on modifying adjacent layers interfacing with the perovskite film.

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays an important role in evading tumor immunity and conferring resistance to immunotherapy. Nanomaterials targeting various immune components in the suppressive TIME can alter the tumor inhibition state, promote the therapeutic effect of anti&#8208;tumor drugs, and enhance anti&#8208;tumor efficacy In this review, we provided an overview of key briefly viewed the key components within the suppressive TIME and various nanoparticles designed to target these components for applications in cancer immunotherapy. Through comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of immune cells in sculpting anti&#8208;tumor immunity, next&#8208;generation nanoscale immunotherapies can be rationally designed to orchestrate a pro&#8208;immunogenic tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising results in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.

Through comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of immune cells in sculpting anti-tumor immunity, next-generation nanoscale immunotherapies can be rationally designed to orchestrate a pro-immunogenic tumor microenvironment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising results in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle-based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti-cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle-based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in the Continuous Flow Synthesis of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;Membered Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 32, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This short review summarises key developments for the synthesis of strained 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems exploiting continuous flow synthesis. These important carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic scaffolds are readily accessed via photochemical, electrochemical and temperature sensitive strategies.







Abstract
Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.

         <dc:description>The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8208;99% yields with 53&#8208;92% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#160;oC in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts on C5N2 for&#160;Nitrogen Fixation at Ambient Conditions : A First&#8208;principles Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit the flexible coordination&#160;structure of the active site and high utilization of active&#160;atoms, making them promising candidates for nitrogen&#160;reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions. By&#160;the aid of first&#8208;principles calculations based on DFT, we&#160;have&#160;systematically explored the NRR catalytic behavior of&#160;thirteen 4d&#8208; and 5d&#8208;transition metal atoms anchored on 2D&#160;porous graphite carbon nitride C5N2. With high selectivity&#160;and outstanding activity, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W and Re&#8208;doped&#160;C5N2 are identified as potential nominees for NRR. Particularly,&#160;Mo@C5N2 possesses an impressive low limiting potential&#160;of &#8722;0.39 V (corresponding to a very low temperature&#160;and atmospheric pressure), featuring the potential determining&#160;step involving *N&#8211;N transitions to *N&#8211;NH via the&#160;distal path. The catalytic performance of TM@C5N2 can&#160;be well characterized by the adsorption strength of intermediate&#160;*N2H. Moreover, there exists a volcanic relationship&#160;between the catalytic property UL and the structure descriptor&#160;&#936;, which validates the robustness and universality&#160;of &#936;, combined with our previous study. This work sheds light on the design of SACs with eminent NRR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Molecule Hybridization at a Ferromagnetic Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a graphene (Gr) buffer layer between a ferromagnetic substrate and a metallorganic molecule is known to mediate the magnetic coupling between them, an effect attributed to a weak hybridization between graphene and molecule. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of this effect through a detailed investigation of the frontier electronic properties of iron phthalocyanine deposited on cobalt&#8208;supported graphene. Despite being physisorbed, the molecular adsorption on Gr/Co induces a sizeable charge transfer from graphene to the molecular macrocycle leading to the partial occupation of the LUMO and the appearance of an energetically localized hybrid state, which can be attributed to the overlap between the graphene pz state and the molecular macrocycle. Graphene is not inert either; the adsorption of the molecule induces doping and alters the Fermi velocity of both the hybrid minicone state and the Dirac cone. Similar effects are observed when the molecular periphery is decorated with fluorine atoms, known for their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, with minimal changes in the energy alignment.</dc:description>

         <title>Disulfide Bonds as Functional Tethers in Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionality of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is often encoded by particular chemical moieties found within these architectures. As such, new techniques to install increasingly more complex functionalities in MOFs are regularly being reported in the literature. One such functional group is the disulfide bond. The redox behavior of this covalent linkage renders MOFs responsive to stimuli, often under reducing conditions. Here, we review examples in which disulfide&#8208;containing MOFs are deployed in applications including drug delivery, therapeutic ferroptosis, exfoliation, energy storage, sensing, and others.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Quenching of Singlet Oxygen by DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their scavenging efficiency toward ROS radicals was shown to be comparable to that of genomic DNA. Herein, we demonstrate that DONs are highly efficient singlet oxygen quenchers outperforming double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA by several orders of magnitude. To this end, a ROS mixture rich in singlet oxygen is generated by light irradiation of the photosensitizer methylene blue and its cytotoxic effect on Escherichia coli cells is quantified in the presence and absence of DONs. DONs are found to be vastly superior to dsDNA in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage and even surpass established ROS scavengers. At a concentration of 15 nM, DONs are about 50&#160;000 times more efficient ROS scavengers than dsDNA at an equivalent concentration. This is attributed to the dominant role of singlet oxygen, which has a long diffusion length and reacts specifically with guanine. The dense packing of the available guanines into the small volume of the DON increases the overall quenching probability compared to a linear dsDNA with the same number of base pairs. DONs thus have great potential to alleviate oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of homoleptic Ni bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;dithiolates, [Ni(S2C2RR&#8242;)2]2&#8211; (R = CN, R&#8242; = CN, CO2Et, CONH2, Ph, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;Cl, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;OMe, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;NO2, Ph&#8208;3&#8208;CF3, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;CF3, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;CN; R = NO2, R&#8242; = H; R = R&#8242; = CO2Et) have been synthesized from the reaction of the alkali metal salt of the ligand and nickel chloride, and isolated as tetraphenylphosphonium or tetrabutylammonium salts. The complexes were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electronic absorption spectroscopies. The molecular structures show a rigidly square planar Ni(II) center linking two four&#8208;membered chelate rings whose dimensions are constant across the series. The electronic effect of the ligand substituents are revealed in the 13C NMR and electronic spectra, and corroborated by density functional calculations. Electron withdrawing groups deshield the low&#8208;field CS2 resonance, and the signature charge transfer band in the visible region is red&#8208;shifted. These observables have been accurately reproduced computationally, and revealed the Ni contribution to the ground state diminishes with decreasing electron withdrawing capacity of the ligand substituents. In contrast to 1,2&#8208;dithiolates, the redox inactivity afforded by 1,1&#8208;dithiolates stems from the smaller chelate ring and substantially reduced sulfur content that is key to stabilizing the radical form.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether functionalized O&#8208;BODIPY Probes for Cations

&#8211; A Selective Fluorescent Probe for Ba2+</title>

3, 4 and 5 equipped with differently sized benzo&#8208;crown

and 5 (benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown7)). O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 exhibited in
comparison to their known F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a (cf.
Scheme 1) an improved solubility in aqueous medium and higher
fluorescence quantum yields. Fluorometric study in aqueous solutions
of 3, 4 and 5 in the presence of different cations show cation induced
fluorescence enhancements (FE). Compared to the benzo&#8208;crown
ether substituted F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a, we found for
the free O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 higher fluorescence quantum yields
(&#981;f
) but lower cation induced FEs. We show that in aqueous medium
the fluorescence quenching process (OFF switching), a photoinduced
electron transfer, in O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 is less effective and
consequently sensitive and selective ON switching of the
fluorescence by cations, too. Albeit these observations the novel
benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped fluorescent probe 5 exhibits a good
fluorometric Ba2+ selectivity and Ba2+ sensitivity in conjunction to their
superior aqueous solubility.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Coordinated Phosphonate Group Directly Observed by 17O&#8208;NMR in Lanthanide(iii) Complexes of a Mono(ethyl phosphonate) DOTA Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamics of mutual exchange of coordinated and non&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms on phosphate anion analogue was measured for the first time. It proceeds through a sterically demanding four&#8208;membered &#954;2&#8208;O2P chelate. Its energy barrier steeply increases for smaller Ln(III) ions and is accessible only in more flexible TSA isomers of large Ln(III) ions.







Abstract
Biological phosphates can coordinate metal ions and their complexes are common in living systems. Dynamics of mutual oxygen atom exchange in the tetrahedral group in complexes has not been investigated. Here, we present a direct experimental proof of exchange (&#8220;phosphonate rotation&#8221;) in model Ln(III) complexes of monophosphonate H4dota analogue which alters phosphorus atom chirality of coordinated phosphonate monoester. Combination of macrocycle&#8208;based isomerism with P&#8208;based chirality leads to several diastereoisomers. (Non)&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms were distinguished through 17O&#8208;labelled phosphonate group and their mutual exchange was followed by various NMR techniques and DFT calculations. The process is sterically demanding and occurs through bulky bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;PO2)&#8722; coordination and was observed only in twisted&#8208;square antiprism (TSA) diastereoisomer of large Ln(III) ions. Its energy demands increase for smaller Ln(III) ions (298&#916;G&#8800;(exp./DFT)=51.8/52.1 and 61.0/71.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for La(III) and Eu(III), respectively). These results are helpful in design of such complexes as MRI CA and for protein paramagnetic NMR probes. It demonstrates usefulness of 17O NMR to study solution dynamics in complexes involving phosphorus acid derivatives and it may inspire use of this method to study dynamics of phosphoric acid derivatives (as e.&#8201;g. phosphorus acid&#8208;based inhibitors of metalloenzymes) in different areas of chemistry.

         <title>Phthalocyanines Synthesis: A State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Review of Sustainable Approaches Through Green Chemistry Metrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Driven by escalating environmental concerns, synthetic chemistry faces an urgent need for a green revolution. Green chemistry, with its focus on low environmental impacting chemicals and minimized waste production, emerges as a powerful tool in addressing this challenge. Metrics such as the E&#8208;factor guide the design of environmentally friendly strategies for chemical processes by quantifying the waste generated in obtaining target products, thus enabling interventions to minimize it. Phthalocyanines (Pcs), versatile molecules with exceptional physical and chemical properties, hold immense potential for technological applications. This review aims to bridge the gap between green chemistry and phthalocyanine synthesis by collecting the main examples of environmentally sustainable syntheses documented in the literature. The calculation of the E&#8208;factor of a selection of them provides insights on how crucial it is to evaluate a synthetic process in its entirety. This approach allows for a better evaluation of the actual sustainability of the phthalocyanine synthetic process and indicates possible strategies to improve it.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of carbon dioxide at the air&#8208;water interface and its chemical implications.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggests that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of Mn(V)&#8208;Oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;Oxyl Conversion: From Closed&#8208;Cubane Photosystem II to Mn(V) Catalysts and the Role of the Entering Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex with a trigonal bipyramidal structure can change its identity to an Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl if it rearranges into a square pyramidal structure. An L ligand can trap the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl complex by coordinating to the square pyramidal structure, thereby making the resulting complex energetically more available to serve as a highly reactive catalyst in H2O oxidation and C&#8722;H bond functionalization.

The low activation barrier for O&#8722;O coupling in the closed&#8208;cubane Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 &#8242;dangler&#8242; ion in the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex into a more reactive Mn4(IV)&#8208;oxyl species, enhancing O&#8722;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind the coordination and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8722;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 dxy orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the dxy orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8722;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)&#8208;based catalysts. For other catalysts, ligands such as OH&#8722; stabilize the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl species better than water, improving catalyst activation for reactions like C&#8722;H bond activation. This study is the first to explain the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl conversion, providing a new foundation for Mn&#8208;based catalyst design.

&lt;p&gt;An Mn(V)-oxo complex with a trigonal bipyramidal structure can change its identity to an Mn(IV)-oxyl if it rearranges into a square pyramidal structure. An L ligand can trap the Mn(IV)-oxyl complex by coordinating to the square pyramidal structure, thereby making the resulting complex energetically more available to serve as a highly reactive catalyst in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation and C&#8722;H bond functionalization.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low activation barrier for O&#8722;O coupling in the closed-cubane Oxygen-Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 &#8242;dangler&#8242; ion in the Mn(V)-oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)-oxo complex into a more reactive Mn4(IV)-oxyl species, enhancing O&#8722;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind the coordination and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8722;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8722;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)-based catalysts.

         <title>Post&#8208;formation of Fused Pentagonal Structure on Fjord Region of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum catalyzes the cleavage of two C&#8722;H bonds at the fjord position of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and the subsequent C&#8722;C bond formation gives a cyclopenta&#8208;PAH. This post&#8208;construction of the pentagonal structure is energetically challenging and requires high temperatures. With water as the medium, it has been found that the monocyclization selectively occurs at a lower temperature. Fe2O3 is effective in suppressing side reactions. We found this reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene in D2O. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsuji and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400987).

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature presents Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family, realizing its unique electronic structure. Theoretical investigations reveal the position of its anionic electron localized outside the molecular structure, adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H moieties. This special charge&#8208;separated configuration is facilitated by an electron transfer from lithium to a molecular orbital located at the back of the calix[3]pyrrole fragment. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Saha, B.&#8197;B. Skjelstad and S. Pan (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400448).

         <title>Expanding the &#960;&#8208;system of fatty acid&#8208;anion transporter conjugates modulates their mechanism of proton transport and mitochondrial uncoupling activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial uncoupling by small molecule protonophores is a promising strategy for developing novel anticancer agents. Recently, aryl urea substituted fatty acids (aryl ureas) were identified as a new class of protonophoric anticancer agents. To mediate proton transport these molecules self&#8208;assemble into membrane&#8208;permeable anionic dimers in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and aryl&#8208;urea anion receptor delocalise the negative charge across the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. In this work, we extend the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system by introducing a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and compare the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds to their monoaryl analogues. It was found that incorporation of meta&#8208;linked phenyl substituents into the aryl urea scaffold enhanced proton transport in vesicles and demonstrated superior capacity to depolarise mitochondria, inhibit ATP production and reduce the viability of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells. In contrast, diphenyl ureas linked through a 1,4&#8208;distribution across the phenyl ring displayed diminished proton transport activity, despite both diphenyl urea isomers possessing similar binding affinities for carboxylates. Mechanistic studies suggest that inclusion of a second aryl ring changes the proton transport mechanism, presumably due to steric factors that impose higher energy penalties for dimer formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations Of (Anti)Aromaticity In Oxidized And Reduced Porphyrin And Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18&#960; neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16&#960; neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16&#960; porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18&#960; dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved excited&#8208;state spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1 h) and high yield (&gt;90%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates. Furthermore, the results highlight its potential for versatile applications across fundamental and translational biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Designed Ultra&#8208;Small CoP Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Highly Efficient Host in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5 &#177; 2.6 nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1 &#177; 3.1 nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8208;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Ultrapotent Tricyclic Ligands for FK506&#8208;Binding proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to small, rigid, and sp3&#8208;rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506&#8208;binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate&#8208;mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely position functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14&#8208;step gram&#8208;scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and N&#8208;acyl iminium cyclization. Structure&#8208;based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Ethylcellulose Polymeric Films: Ag(I)&#8208;Based Components and Curcumin as Reinforcing Ingredients for Enhanced Food Packaging Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;active ethylcellulose (EC) polymeric films have been obtained by incorporating curcumin (curc) and Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds, known for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, respectively, within the polymeric matrix. The recently reported Ag(I) coordination polymer, in both its structural forms (&#945;&#8208;[(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; and &#946;&#8208;{[(bpy)Ag][OTf]}&#8734;), and the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc polymeric co&#8208;crystal (bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) have been selected as Ag(I) species. The hybrid composite films have been prepared through the simple solvent casting method and characterized through Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The deep investigation of the film samples highlighted the non&#8208;inert behaviour of EC towards these specific active ingredients. Antimicrobial tests showed that EC films embedding the Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds present good antimicrobial performance, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, used as a model of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In addition, Silver migration tests, performed on the Ag(I)&#8208;incorporating EC films, evidenced low values of silver release particularly in the case of the EC films incorporating [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational modeling approach is applied to rationalize the impact of streptavidin mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura synthesis of binaphthyls by means of an Artificial Metalloenzyme built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology. The integrative computational approach includes DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.

         <title>Asymmetric and Chemoselective Iridium Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Conjugated Unsaturated Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxime ethers is described. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded smoothly at (20&#8211;50&#8197;bar) room temperature. The generated chiral oxime ethers showed good isolated yields and excellent enantioselectivity (84&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, &gt;97&#8201;% ee). The hydrogenation products could be further hydrolysed to chiral ketones.







Abstract
Research on the chemoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of conjugated &#960;&#8208;systems has mostly been focussed on enones. Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P&#8208;iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;% ee). No hydrogenation of the C=N &#960;&#8208;bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20&#8197;bar H2, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.

Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P-iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). No hydrogenation of the C=N &#960;-bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20&#8197;bar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;-carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Behaviors of Isostructural Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Naphthalene, Quinoxaline, and Pyrazinopyrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural reticular frameworks with systematic differences on chemical structures allows us to disclose correlations between specific structural factors and properties, providing insights for designing novel porous materials. However, even slight differences in the molecular structure often result in formation of non&#8208;isostructural polymorphic frameworks particularly in the case of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) because the structures of HOFs are based on a subtle balance of reversible interactions. In this study, we found that three simple analogues of tetracarboxylic acids with naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores (NT, QX, and PP, respectively) yielded isostructural solvated HOFs (NT&#8208;1, QX&#8208;1, and PP&#8208;1, respectively), where hydrogen&#8208;bonded sql&#8208;networked sheets were slip&#8208;stacked with closely similar manners. These isostructural HOFs underwent structural transformations in different manners upon removal of the guest solvents. Comparison of the crystal structures of the HOFs before and after the transformation revealed that intermolecular interactions of the core significantly affected on rearrangements of hydrogen bonds in the transformation. The results suggest the potential to control the properties and functions of isostructural HOFs by elemental doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrophenol Reduction with Silver Oxide Nanostructures as a Sustainable Approach to Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose silver oxide as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for the catalytic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds.&#160; In the present investigation, we have adopted a facile and green synthetic route for the synthesis of silver oxide nanostructures. The prepared nanostructures were found to have crystallized in the cuprite phase and exhibited absorbance over the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The catalytic potential of the silver oxide was evaluated by following the kinetics of nitrophenol reduction under ambient conditions and is observed to follow pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant kapp = 4.24 x 10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 at minimum concentration of the catalyst. We attribute the observed catalytic activity to the freshly generated catalytic surface featuring a partially reduced form of silver oxide. The findings highlight the efficacy of silver oxide in mitigating the environmental pollution originating from the recalcitrant nitroarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway Selection in Temporal Evolution of Supramolecular Polymers of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Amphiphilic Organic Solvent Dictates the Fate of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AOS dictates aqueous: The temporal evolution of short supramolecular polymers (SPs) of ionic &#960;&#8208;systems into long SP networks in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixture follows two distinct pathways. The release or retaining water from ionic &#960;&#8208;systems is the key for pathway selection, and it is dictated by AOS.







Abstract
Understanding solvent&#8208;solute interactions is essential to designing and synthesising soft materials with tailor&#8208;made functions. Although the interaction of the solute with the solvent mixture is more complex than the single solvent medium, solvent mixtures are exciting to unfold several unforeseen phenomena in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report two unforeseen pathways observed during the hierarchical assembly of cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixtures. When the aqueous supramolecular polymers (SPs) of cPDIs are injected into AOS, initially kinetically trapped short SPs are formed, which gradually transform into thermodynamically stable high aspect ratio SP networks. Using various experimental and theoretical investigations, we found that this temporal evolution follows two distinct pathways depending on the nature of the water&#8208;AOS interactions. If the AOS is isopropanol (IPA), water is released from cPDIs into bulk IPA due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which further decreases the monomer concentration of cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;1). In the case of dioxane AOS, cPDI monomer concentration further increases as water is retained among cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;2) due to relatively weak interactions between dioxane and water. Interestingly, these two pathways are accelerated by external stimuli such as heat and mechanical agitation.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a spirosilabifluorene cyclic trimer have been successfully demonstrated. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were decreased through the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties were investigated from both experimental and theoretical points of view with careful discussion.







Abstract
A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (P,P,P)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed a high emission quantum yield (&#934;f=80&#8201;%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp=&#8722;1.2&#215;10&#8722;3). According to the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of &#964;f=1.89&#8197;ns.

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208;Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the role of exocyclic replacement of carbonyl oxygen of psoralen with sulfur and selenium. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies revealed a significant red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased oscillator strength, and spin&#8208;orbit coupling values, along with reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps in thio and seleno derivatives of psoralen. These factors led to efficient triplet harvesting, enabling them as promising photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8722;5&#8197;s for Pso to 10&#8722;8&#8197;s for TPso and 10&#8722;9&#8197;s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115&#8197;GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8211;1050&#8197;nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.

The reduction in singlet-triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin-orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s for Pso to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s for TPso and 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s for SePso. The intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115&#8197;GM of two-photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8211;1050&#8197;nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control Over Anion Coordination on Pd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) with Regioisomeric Phosphine&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of regioisomeric carboxylate&#8208;phosphine ligands is shown to enable control over anion coordination on Pd(II) centers. Palladium(II) carboxylates are important for C&#8722;H activation and the complexes with specific orientations of the carboxylate anion or with a coordinated carboxylic acid group provide relevant coordination models. Additionally, the spatial anion control can be extended to other metal centers.







Abstract
The coordination of anionic donors is involved at various stages of catalytic cycles in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, but control over the spatial positioning of anions around a metal center is a challenge in coordination chemistry. Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;2, cis&#8208;&#954;1, or trans&#8208;&#954;1 coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal&#8208;alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation transition state for C&#8722;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.

         <title>Recent advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl sulfones are crucial building blocks in synthetic chemistry and core structural units of pharmaceutically active molecules, thus extensive investigations have been conducted on the construction of these skeletons. In contrast to the classical synthetic approaches, the radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Radical sulfonation of alkynes typically begins with the sulfonyl radical attacking the alkynes, followed by further functionalization. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. However, there is no comprehensive review summarizing the advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation), along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linking Networks as Durable Bifunctional Coating for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serious dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross&#8208;linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross&#8208;linking, AT network coating is endowed with self&#8208;healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2/2 mAh cm&#8208;2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087 h at large charge/discharge depths of 10 mA cm&#8208;2/10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175 mAh g&#8208;1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Aerobic Upcycling of Polystyrene Plastics via Synergistic Indirect HAT Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution constitutes an evergrowing urgent environmental problem, since overaccumulation of plastic waste, arising from the immense increase of the production of disposable plastic products, overcame planet&#8217;s capacity to properly handle them. Chemical upcycling of polystyrene constitutes a convenient method for the conversion of plastic waste into high&#8208;added value chemicals, suggesting an attractive perspective in dealing with the environmental crisis. We demonstrate herein a novel, easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform organocatalytic photoinduced aerobic protocol, which proceeds via synergistic indirect hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis under LED 390 nm Kessil lamps as the irradiation source. The developed method employs a BrCH2CN&#8208;thioxanthone photocatalytic system and was successfully applied to a variety of everyday&#8208;life plastic products, leading to the isolation of benzoic acid after simple base&#8208;acid work up in yields varying from 23&#8208;49%, while a large&#8208;scale experiment was successfully performed, suggesting that the photocatalytic step is susceptible to industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoredox Thiol&#8208;yne Reaction for the Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Coumarins and its Effect on Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumarins still remain one of the most widely explored fluorescent dyes, with a broad spectrum of applications spanning various fields, such as molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, or medical sciences. Their fluorescence is strongly based on a push&#8208;pull mechanism involving an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), mainly located at the C7 or C8 positions of the dye core. Unfortunately, up to now, these positions have been very limited to hydroxyl or amino groups. In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol&#8211;yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium&#8208; or porphyrin&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late&#8208;stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in a single&#8208;step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;benzothiazole, 6&#8208;8&#8208;difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204 nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Fluorenyl&#8208;Based Copolyimines with Adjustable Mechanical Properties, Recyclability and Friction Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic polyimines are a class of fascinating dynamic polymers with recyclability and reparability owing to their reversible Schiff&#8208;base reactions. However, balancing the dynamic properties and mechanical strength of dynamic polyimines presents a major challenge due to the dissociative and associative nature of the imine bonds. Herein, we introduced bulky fluorene groups and polyether amine into the skeleton of polyimine networks to achieve a tradeoff in comprehensive properties. The resulting dynamic polyimines with fluorene groups (Cardo&#8208;DPIs) were successfully synthesized by combining the rigid diamine 9,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)fluorene and the flexible polyether amine, demonstrating a high tensile strength of 64.7 MPa. Additionally, Cardo&#8208;DPIs films with more content of rigid fluorene groups exhibited higher water resistance, glass transition temperature and wear&#8208;resisting ability. Moreover, the Cardo&#8208;DPIs films not only efficiently underwent thermal reshaping, but also exhibited excellent self&#8208;healing capabilities and chemical degradation in acidic solutions. Furthermore, the resulting films can achieve fully closed&#8208;loop recovery by free amine solution for 2 h at room temperature. This study broadens the scope of dynamic polyimine materials and promotes the balanced development of their functional and mechanical properties.</dc:description>

Herein, we introduced bulky fluorene groups and polyether amine into the skeleton of polyimine networks to achieve a tradeoff in comprehensive properties. The resulting dynamic polyimines with fluorene groups (Cardo-DPIs) were successfully synthesized by combining the rigid diamine 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorene and the flexible polyether amine, demonstrating a high tensile strength of 64.7 MPa. Additionally, Cardo-DPIs films with more content of rigid fluorene groups exhibited higher water resistance, glass transition temperature and wear-resisting ability.

         <dc:description>An achiral Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/annulation of chiral sulfoximine&#8208;enabled thioamides with ynamides is presented herein. This method successfully synthesizes axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones with good enantiocontrol. Interestingly, the annulation with chiral oxazolidone&#8208;containing ynamides could provide a separable mixture of diastereomers (up to ~10:1 dr). Moreover, enantiopure sulfoximines could be recovered with ~99% purity, making this method practical.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclopropanation of Active Methylene Derivatives Based on FeCl2 or FeCl3&#8208;Promoted Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bicyclic cyclopropanes were synthesized by two radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions based on the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization of active methylene derivatives and the redox radical cyclization of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes using the subcatalytic amount of FeCl2 and ligand.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were studied for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of active methylene derivatives. In the presence of FeCl3 as a stoichiometric oxidant and K2HPO4 as a base, the dehydrogenative cyclopropanation of active methylenes proceeded through the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization followed by the ionic cyclization to give the bicyclic cyclopropanes. The use of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes leads the subcatalytic cyclopropanation involving two redox pathways. In the presence of K2HPO4, the redox cyclopropanation proceeded by using FeCl2 (20&#8197;mol%) in combination with ligand (20&#8197;mol%).

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged units with special electronic effect are introduced to the TTM unit to construct stable luminescent radicals (BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM). NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm, while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm (100&#8197;meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm (130&#8197;meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.

         <title>Tandem Four&#8208;Component Reaction to Access Fused Polycycles Exhibiting Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of fused polycyclic compounds were synthesized efficiently through tandem four&#8208;component reactions that incorporated a chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based dicarbaldehyde, malonitrile and two carbonyl acetonitriles. Notably, Aggregation&#8208;enhanced through&#8208;space charge transfer emission could be observed based on the polycyclic spacer. Theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication.







Abstract
Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine&#8208;promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face&#8208;to&#8208;face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis.

     alt="Tandem Four-Component Reaction to Access Fused Polycycles Exhibiting Aggregation-Enhanced Through-Space Charge Transfer Emission"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of fused polycyclic compounds were synthesized efficiently through tandem four-component reactions that incorporated a chiral binaphthyl-based dicarbaldehyde, malonitrile and two carbonyl acetonitriles. Notably, Aggregation-enhanced through-space charge transfer emission could be observed based on the polycyclic spacer. Theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine-promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face-to-face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through-space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis. This work not only provides guidance for the one-step synthesis of complex polycycles, but also offers valuable insights into the design of aggregation-enhanced TSCT emission materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peri&#8208;Alkylated Terrylenes and Ternaphthalenes Building&#8208;Blocks Towards Multi&#8208;Edge Nanographenes

A facile synthetic route has been developed to produce highly soluble peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its derivatives with enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation at bay&#8208;regions. The synthesized terrylene derivatives exhibit remarkably high fluorescence quantum yields and molar extinction coefficients, making them ideal candidates for applications in single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy, photonics, and quantum emission.







Abstract
Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8211; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene's peri&#8208;positions &#8211; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene's chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization along with transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.

         <title>Solution&#8208;State Structure of a Long&#8208;Loop G&#8208;Quadruplex Formed Within Promoters of Plasmodium falciparum B var Genes</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2]. The G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal 10&#8208;nt loop shows a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;standard hydrogen bonding. In addition to the 12&#8197;guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in the loop regions are well defined and involved in the interactions.







Abstract
We report the high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal loop of ten nucleotides. The G&#8208;quadruplex is formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2], named UpsB&#8208;Q&#8208;1. This sequence is found within promoters of the var genes of Plasmodium falciparum, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North&#8208;South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G&#8208;quartet&#8208;loop interfaces.

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs.







Abstract
It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.

         <title>Unique Reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;Bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene Moiety: Application to the Synthesis of 7&#8208;Norbornanone Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
The silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons of 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadienes prepared from 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanediones exhibit unique reactivities. Despite being sterically hindered, one of these carbons attacks on the carbocation generated at the &#948;&#8208;position to form a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Subsequent skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core produces the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one.







Abstract
We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones by exploiting the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated by the silylation of a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing a picolinoyloxy group at the 2&#8242; position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. The release of the acyloxy group during the reaction generates carbocations that are then attacked by silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety skeleton, forming a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core results in the formation of the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one. This novel transformation of 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moieties can be used to synthesise other cyclopentenone&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks.

This novel transformation of 1,3-cyclopentanedione moieties can be used to synthesise other cyclopentenone-fused bicyclic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 was synthesized using the ammonothermal synthesis. Analysis of the compound is performed using X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. The characterization of the imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, only the second representative of this compound class, as possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates helps to improve the understanding for the ammonothermal synthesis of nitrides.







Abstract
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870&#8197;K and 230&#8197;MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a=10.9422(4)&#8197;&#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of such intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.

The Cover Feature illustrates an activated carboxylic acid (ACA) pushing a swing in order to populate the high&#8208;energy state associated with the aromatic imine laid on the swing seat. The energy derived from the decarboxylation of the ACA is partially diverted into the imine dynamic library that is temporarily brought into an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state in which an aromatic imine prevails over an aliphatic imine.

         <title>Opportunities of MXenes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: V2C as Aerobic Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes, 2D nanomaterials constituted by alternating stacking of transition metal and carbide layers, drawn here as the fronds of a palm tree, are proposed as heterogeneous catalysts in the Concept by A. Dhakshinamoorthy, R. Ram&#237;rez&#8208;Grau, H. Garcia and A. Primo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400576). MXenes convert indane molecules, represented as birds flying to the tree, into indanol and indanone products that are hanging on the tree as fruits. The sea and the beach highlight that the process is environmentally benign.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Oxygenative Rearrangement of Tetrahydrocarbazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a general copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the tunable oxygenative rearrangement of tetrahydrocarbazoles to cyclopentyl&#8208;bearing spiroindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and spiroindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The method demonstrates excellent chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and product control simply by using the H2O and O2 as oxygen source, respectively. This open&#8208;flask method is safe and simple to operate, and no other chemical oxidants are required. Besides, inspired from the unique pathway of 1, 2&#8208;migration rearrangement, a highly controllable hydroxylation of indoles for the construction of C3a&#8208;hydroxyl iminium indolines was also developed. Mechanistic experiments suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;induced oxidation process is responsible for the tunable selectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis by 21&#8208;Thiaporphyrins: A green and Efficient Approach for C&#8208;N Borylation and C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic C&#8208;N borylation and C&#8208;H arylation&#160;mostly depend on the ruthenium and iridium complexes or eosin Y and the use of porphyrin catalysts is still in infancy. A series of novel 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins (A2B2 and A3B type) were synthesized having carbazole/phenothiazine moieties at their meso&#8208;positions and screened as catalysts for C&#8208;N borylation and C&#8208;H arylation. This paper demonstrates the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyzed C&#8208;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1 mol% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C&#8208;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation reactions. A variety of substituted anilines were used as source for expensive and unstable aryl diazonium salts in the reactions. The heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters were obtained in decent yields (up to 88%). Versatility of the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst was tested by thiolation and selenylation of anilines under similar conditions. Mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT studies, suggesting that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin undergo an oxidative quenching pathway. The photoredox process catalyzed by 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins offers a mild, efficient and metal&#8208;free alternative for the formation of C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, and C&#8208;Se bonds in aryl compounds; it can also be extended to borylation reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic C-N borylation and C-H arylation&#160;mostly depend on the ruthenium and iridium complexes or eosin Y and the use of porphyrin catalysts is still in infancy. A series of novel 21-thiaporphyrins (A2B2 and A3B type) were synthesized having carbazole/phenothiazine moieties at their meso-positions and screened as catalysts for C-N borylation and C-H arylation. This paper demonstrates the 21-thiaporphyrin catalyzed C-N borylation and het-arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1 mol% of 21-thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C-N borylation and het-arylation reactions.

         <title>Probing the Electron Accepting Ability of Phosphaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphaphenalenes, extended &#960; conjugates with the incorporation of phosphorus, are attractive avenues towards molecular materials for the applications in organic electronics, but their electron accepting ability have not been investigated. In this study, we present systematic studies on the reductive behavior of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide by chemical and electrochemical methods. The chemical reduction of the phosphaphenalene by alkali metals reveals the facile P&#8210;C bond cleavage to form phosphaphenalenide anion, which functions as a transfer block for structure modification on the phosphorus atom. In contrast, the pentavalent P&#8208;oxide reacts with one or two equivalents of elemental sodium to form stable radical anion and dianion salts, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Visible Light&#8208;Induced C(sp2)&#8722;H Arylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and coumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a visible light&#8208;induced C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation method for quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and coumarins using iodonium ylides without the need for external photocatalysts. The protocol demonstrates a broad substrate scope, enabling the arylation of diverse heterocycles through a simple and mild procedure. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction showcases its applicability in the efficient synthesis of biologically active molecules. Computational investigations at the CASPT2//CASSCF/PCM level of theory revealed that the excited state of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one facilitates electron transfer from its &#960; bond to the antibonding orbital of the C&#8722;I bond in the iodonium ylide, ultimately leading to the formation of an aryl radical, which subsequently participates in the C&#8208;H arylation process. In addition, our calculations reveal that via single&#8208; electron transfer (SET) process, the C&#8722;I bond cleavage in iodonium ylide and new C&#8722;C bond formation between resultant aryl radical and cationic quinoxaline species take place in a concerned manner. This enables the arylation reaction to efficiently proceed along an energy&#8208;efficient route.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Efficient Eu(III) and Yb(III) Sensitisation from a Re(I) Tetrazolato Triangular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of Re(CO)5Br with deprotonated 1H&#8208;(5&#8208;(2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine)pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)tetrazole yields a triangular assembly formed by tricarbonyl Re(I) vertices. Photophysical measurements reveal blue&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 520 nm, 32% quantum yield, and 2430 ns long&#8208;lived excited state decay lifetime in deaerated dichloromethane solution. Coordination of lanthanoid ions to the terpyridine units red&#8208;shifts the emission to 570 nm and also reveals efficient (90%) and fast sensitisation to both Eu(III) and Yb(III) at room temperature, with a similar rate constant kET of the order of 107 s&#8208;1. Efficient sensitisation of Eu(III) from Re(I) is unprecedented, especially when considering the close proximity in energy between the donor and acceptor excited states. On the other hand, comparative measurements at 77 K reveal that energy transfer to Yb(III) is two orders of magnitude slower than that to Eu(III). A two&#8208;step mechanism of sensitisation is therefore proposed, whereby the rate&#8208;determining step is a thermally activated energy transfer step between the Re(I) centre and the terpyridine functionality, followed by rapid energy transfer to the respective Ln(III) excited states. At 77 K, the direct Re(I) to Eu(III) energy transfer seems to proceed via a ligand&#8208;mediated superexchange Dexter&#8208;type mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) As Hydrogen Storage Materials At Near&#8208;Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen may play a critical role in our efforts to de&#8208;carbonize by 2050. However, there remain technical challenges in the storage and transport of hydrogen. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown significant promise for hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperatures. A material that can meet the US department of energy (DOE) ultimate goal of 6.5 wt. % for gravimetric performance and 50g/L for volumetric storage at near&#8208;ambient temperatures would unlock hydrogen as a future fuel source for on&#8208;board applications. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks typically have low heat of adsorptions (i.e. 4&#8208;7 kJ/mol), whereas for storing significant quantities of hydrogen at near&#8208;ambient temperatures, 15&#8208;25 kJ/mol is likely required. In this review we explore the current methods used (i.e., open&#8208;metal sites, alkali dopants and hydrogen spillover) for promoting strong adsorption within MOFs. Further we discuss MOF&#8208;based materials with respect to the technical aspects of deliverable capacity, kinetics and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Photoswitches with Enhanced Solar Spectrum Match</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report monomeric and dimeric norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane molecular photoswitch systems intended for molecular solar thermal applications. A series of six new norbornadiene derivatives conjugated with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and dithiafulvene as the donor unit were synthesized and fully characterized. The photoswitches were evaluated by experimentally and theoretically measuring optical absorption profiles and thermal conversion of quadricyclane to norbornadiene. Computational insight by density functional theory calculations at the M06&#8208;2X/def2&#8208;SVPD level of theory provided geometries, storage energies, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra and HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels, that are used to describe the function of the molecular systems. The studied molecules exhibit absorption onset ranging from 416 nm to 595 nm due to a systemic change in their donor&#8208;acceptor character. This approach was advantageous due to the introduction of benzothiadiazole and the dimeric nature of molecular structures. The best&#8208;performing system has a half&#8208;life of 3 days.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Quinazoline (Qz)&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been constructed via a three&#8208;component reaction of ortho&#8208;acylanilines, benzaldehydes and NH4OAc. The structure of Qz&#8208;COFs has been confirmed by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. The Qz&#8208;COFs possess high chemical stability, showing good endurance to strong acid, strong base, oxidant, reductant and other conditions. Particularly, Qz&#8208;COF&#8208;3 can catalyze the aerobic photooxidation of toluene and other compounds containing C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation &#160;reaction of exocyclic enamines/enol ethers with 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone esters has been developed, providing facile access to N,O&#8208; spiroketals and spiroketals under mild conditions with broad substrate scope (26 examples, 71&#8208;94% yields). Gram scale synthesis and chemical transformations demonstrated that this method is potentially useful in the synthesis of natural products and drugs containing a N,O&#8208; spiroketal moiety. The chiral N,O&#8208;spiroketal could be obtained with 98% ee after recrystallization, when a chiral SaBOX ligand was employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Heavy Atom Effect in Germylene for Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is worth but still challenging to develop the low&#8208;valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene&#8208;based persistent phosphors by introduction of low&#8208;valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors CzGe and its series of derivatives, namely CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low&#8208;valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled GeCz had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309 ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84 %, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors.This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The link of an antenna dye with an electron spin converter, in this case naphthalenediimide and C60, produces a system with a rich photophysics including the detection of more than one triplet state on the long timescale (tens of &#181;s). Beside the use of optical spectroscopies in the ns and in the fs time scale, we used time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (TREPR) to study the system evolution following photoexcitation. TREPR keeps track of the formation path of the triplet states through specific spin polarization patterns observed in the spectra. The flexibility of the linker plays a role in favouring either electron transfer or energy transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time LSPR&#8208;Based Study of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LSPR spectroscopy is applied to monitor the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer like deposition of twelve different MOFs based on Cu, Al, Fe and Zn. The microfluidic setup of LSPR enables an in&#8208;situ spectroscopic readout based on the plasmonic properties of immobilized gold nanoparticle sensors under mild synthesis conditions. The MOF&#8208;coated nanoparticles can be used in gas sensing applications.







Abstract
MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88&#8197;A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a very promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include the optimization of the synthesis process or the transfer to other materials.

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and multiple modifications toward linkage lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, thus boosting photogenerated carrier separation and migration, enabling remarkably promoted photoctalytic HER performance, which highlights the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.







Abstract
Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that multiple modifications toward linkage synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8722;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3 a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration. This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation of the Fungal Metabolite (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B: Inhibition of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal metabolite that inhibits Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk), showing immunomodulatory potential. Docking revealed binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk active site. Newly synthesised analogues were tested, corroborating docking observations and highlighting the requirements for Btk inhibition and selectivity. These findings inform the development of new Btk inhibitors for leukemia and immune disorders.







Abstract
The natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti&#8208;cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure&#8208;based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B&#8208;based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.

&lt;p&gt;(&#8722;)-TAN-2483B is a fungal metabolite that inhibits Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk), showing immunomodulatory potential. Docking revealed binding modes for (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B and analogues in the Btk active site. Newly synthesised analogues were tested, corroborating docking observations and highlighting the requirements for Btk inhibition and selectivity. These findings inform the development of new Btk inhibitors for leukemia and immune disorders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural product (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti-cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure-based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B-based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcrowded 14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes: Challenges in Syntheses and Atypical Property of Lacking Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer (SBCT)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overcrowded biaryl bears two highly distorted molecular halves and a small interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties (31&#176;, currently the lowest reported value). The close contact between the two aryl fragments endows them with intramolecular interactions. Whereas the restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond suspends the formation of the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state.







Abstract
14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes (BDBAs) were prepared by iridium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;biterphenylene with alkynes. The molecular geometries of overcrowded BDBAs were verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The two dibenzo[a,j]anthryl moieties are connected through the sterically hindered 14 positions, resulting in highly distorted molecular halves. The conformation with a small twist angle between two molecular halves can minimize steric conflicts between the substituents at 1 and 13 positions and the carbon atoms of the central axis, as well as steric clashes between those substituents. One such example is octafluoro&#8208;substituted BDBA, where the interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties is approximately 31&#176; (currently the lowest reported value, cf. 81&#176; in 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bianthracene). The intramolecular interactions and electronic couplings between two molecular halves resulted in upfield 1H NMR signals, redshifted absorption and emission bands, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Photodynamic investigations on BDBAs indicated that the formation of the conventional symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state was suspended by restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond. Such a mechanism associated with this highly constrained conformation was examined for the first time.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Defects in Uranyl Trinitrate Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl trinitrate solid&#8208;state materials are exposed to gamma radiation and characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations confirm the spectroscopic signatures and the presence of a nitrate radical bound in a monodentate fashion to the uranyl cation. Including alkali cations in the theoretic models is crucial to accurate calculation of the g&#8208;values.







Abstract
Actinides are inherently radioactive; thus, ionizing radiation is emitted by these elements can have profound effects on its surrounding chemical environment through the formation of free radical species. While previous work has noted that the presence of free radicals in the system impacts the redox state of the actinides, there is little atomistic understanding of how these metal cations interact with free radicals. Herein, we explore the effects of radiation (UV and &#947;) on three U(VI) trinitrate complexes, M[UO2(NO3)3] (where M=K+, Rb+, Cs+), and their respective nitrate salts in the solid state via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy paired with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We find that the alkali salts form nitrate radicals under UV and &#947; irradiation, but also note the presence of additional degradation products. M[UO2(NO3)3] solids also form nitrate radicals and additional DFT calculations indicate the species corresponds to a change from the bidentate bound nitrate anion into a monodentate NO3&#8226; radical. Computational studies also highlight the need to include the second sphere coordination environment around the [UO2(NO3)3]0,1 species to gain agreement between the experimental and predicted EPR signatures.

         <title>High&#8208;Intensity Circular Dichroism of Head&#8208;To&#8208;Tail Regioregular Poly(1,4&#8208;Phenylene)s in the Aggregated State</title>

The use of nickel&#8208;Chiraphos complex as a catalyst enables the synthesis of a variety of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) with a chiral side chain and provides new insights into the correlation with their helical structure through the measurement of CD spectra.







Abstract
Circular dichroism (CD) studies on poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s bearing a chiral side chain in the aggregated conditions were carried out. Little CD was observed in a solution form, while addition of a poor solvent into the polyphenylene solution induced aggregation and a strong CD was observed, accordingly. Applying the controlled degree of polymerization (DP) of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) in the use of bidentate diphosphine Chiraphos as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, the relationship of DP with CD strength was studied to reveal to show the highest CD at the DP=84 (gabs=ca. 2&#215;10&#8722;2). It was also found that the related aggregation was observed in good solvent 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane upon standing the solution at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8211;23&#8197;days to observe gabs=ca. 10&#8722;1. Studies on the substituent effect of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) suggested that CD behaviors were dependent on the type of non&#8208;chiral substituent on the aromatic ring as well as the side&#8208;chain chirality.

         <title>Dead Lithium in Lithium Metal Batteries: Formation, Characterization and Strategies</title>

         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) replacing graphite anode for developing Li metal batteries (LMB) with the higher energy density has attracted much attention. However, LMA faces many issues, e.g., Li dendrites, dead Li and the side reactions, which causes the safety hazards and low coulomb efficiency (CE) of battery, therefore, LMB still cannot replace the current Li ion battery for practical use. Among those issues, dead Li is one of the decisive factors affecting the CE of LMB. To better understand dead Li, we summarize the recent work about the generation of dead Li, its impact on batteries performance, and the strategies to reuse and eliminate dead Li. Finally, the prospect of the future LMA and resultant LMB is also put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Structural Factors in the Luminescence Properties of Persulfurated Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence rarely occurs from pure organic molecules, especially in the solid&#8208;state. A strategy for the design of highly emissive organic phosphors is still hard to predict, thus impeding the development of new functional materials with the desired optical properties. Herein, we analyze a family of alkyl and aryl&#8208;substituted persulfurated benzenes, the latter representing a class of organic solid&#8208;state triplet emitters able to show very high emission quantum yield at room temperature. In this work, we correlate structural parameters with the photophysical properties observed in different experimental conditions (diluted solution, crystalline and amorphous phase at RT and low temperature). Our results, corroborated by a detailed computational analysis, indicate a close relationship between the luminescence properties and i) the nature of the substituents on the persulfurated core, ii) the adopted conformations in the solid state, both in crystalline and amorphous phases. These factors contribute to characterize the lowest&#8208;energy lying excited&#8208;state, its deactivation pathways, the phosphorescence lifetime and quantum yield.

A strategy for the design of highly emissive organic phosphors is still hard to predict, thus impeding the development of new functional materials with the desired optical properties. Herein, we analyze a family of alkyl and aryl-substituted persulfurated benzenes, the latter representing a class of organic solid-state triplet emitters able to show very high emission quantum yield at room temperature. In this work, we correlate structural parameters with the photophysical properties observed in different experimental conditions (diluted solution, crystalline and amorphous phase at RT and low temperature). Our results, corroborated by a detailed computational analysis, indicate a close relationship between the luminescence properties and i) the nature of the substituents on the persulfurated core, ii) the adopted conformations in the solid state, both in crystalline and amorphous phases. These factors contribute to characterize the lowest-energy lying excited-state, its deactivation pathways, the phosphorescence lifetime and quantum yield. These findings provide a useful roadmap for the development of highly performing purely organic solid-state emitters based on the persulfurated benzene platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Reductive Recycling of Cathode Materials of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to digest lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode material recycling and regeneration methods based on the reduction reaction mechanism. It discusses several reductants commonly used in the recycling process, and introduces some recently proposed direct regeneration methods. Finally, it concludes and outlooks the battery recycling based on the reduction reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high&#8208;value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms. This deficiency of awareness highlights the need for further research and development in this area. This review aims to systematically review and thoroughly discuss the reduction reaction mechanism of each method regarding different cathode materials. And systematically digest the selection of reducing agent and the effect of reduction reaction on material regeneration are systematically digested, as well as the impact of the reduction reaction on the regeneration of materials. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing efficiency, economic and environmental benefits in reuse technologies. Finally, the review proposes an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing the reuse of key materials for next&#8208;generation spent batteries aimed at promoting the green and sustainable development of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, circular economy and ecological balance.

         <title>Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the stereochemistry of cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs) is simplified and made more universal. By comparing the (CH&#945;) HSQC NMR fingerprint of linear diastereomeric sequences from automated synthesis with linearized natural compound obtained by controlled hydrolysis, the procedure for stereochemistry determination is streamlined. The adaptable approach enhances research efficiency across the diverse CLiP structural portfolio.







Abstract
We previously described NMR based fingerprint matching with peptide backbone resonances as a fast and reliable structural dereplication approach for Pseudomonas cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs). In combination with total synthesis of a small library of configurational CLiP congeners this also allows unambiguous determination of stereochemistry, facilitating structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and enabling three&#8208;dimensional structure determination. However, the on&#8208;resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow brings considerable burden and limits universal applicability. This drawback is here removed altogether by also transforming the native CLiP into a linearized analogue by controlled saponification of the ester bond. This eliminates the need for macrocycle formation, limiting the synthesis effort to linear peptide analogues. NMR fingerprints of such linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide from Pseudomonas ekonensis COR58, a newly isolated lipododecapeptide that defines a new group characterized by a ten&#8208;residue large macrocycle, the largest to date in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the saponification&#8208; enhanced approach that broadens applicability of NMR fingerprint matching for the determination of the stereochemistry of CLiPs.

         <title>Crystalline CdS/Amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibits a highest CO Faradaic efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. Meanwhile, the CO Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90&#8201;% can be obtained in a wide potential window of 1000&#8197;mV with the maximum CO partial current density of 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90&#8201;%) under a wide potential window of 1.0&#8197;V, with the highest value reaching ~100&#8201;% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that covalently linked norcorrole dimers formed closely stacked assemblies based on the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems. The supramolecular assembling event of the norcorrole dimers occurred through high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting. The subtle modification in the linking position and peripheral substituents resulted in complete change both in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode.







Abstract
Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity due to substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is (3.6&#177;1.7)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. In the solid state, 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Heterocycle&#8208; and Amine&#8208;Free Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Molecules for Energy&#8208;Saving See&#8208;Through Smart Windows and Displays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new electrochromes are synthesized by functionalizing tetrabenzofluorene core with acceptor units, without using heterocyclic rings and amine derivatives. These molecules can switch color from pale yellow to dark hues and also display electrofluorochromism. Smart windows fabricated using these electrochromes can store the injected energy and the stored energy can be reused to charge electronic gadgets.







Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are an elegant alternative to dusty curtains, blinds, and traditional dimming devices. The EC energy storage smart windows and displays received remarkable attention in the optoelectronic industry as they hold promise for high energy efficiency, low power consumption, reversibility, and swift response to stimuli. However, achieving these properties remains challenging. Moreover, most EC molecules do not exhibit electrofluorochromism, which is highly essential for smart displays because its EC property can modulate the solar heat entering the building, and its electrofluorochromic (EFC) aspects can create lighting during the night. In this work, a structure&#8208;property relationship is utilized to develop new electrochromes that can store the injected charge, and these molecules indeed exhibit electrofluorochromism. The compounds are synthesized from tetrabenzofluorene with two aromatic acceptor units, and avoids the use of widely studied heterocycles and amine derivatives. The electrochromes switches from yellow to dark hue in solution, solid, and gel state. The compounds display exceptional electrochemical stability and reversibility in 1000 cycles and capacity retention of 93&#8211;100&#8201;% in 300 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device fabrication of the self&#8208;dimming EC smart window presented here demonstrates that it can furnish visual comfort, modulate transmitted light and glare, and reduce energy usage.

         <title>Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ&#8208;His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer from an imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand to a covalently bound photooxidant was characterized. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded imidazole accepts the phenolic proton and releases a proton from its 1&#8208;nitrogen group stabilizing the oxidized state. The system works with low driving force and closely mimics the Tyrz&#8208;His couple at the donor side of photosystem II.







Abstract
A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&#964;&lt;50&#8197;ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5&#8211;9&#8197;&#956;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1&#8208;nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Triazole&#8208;Derived Mesoionic Imines with Ferrocenyl Substituents and their Metal Complexes: Directed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, Unusual C&#8722;H Activation and Ion&#8208;Pair Formation</title>

The properties of redox&#8208;active MIIs and their metal complexes are shown to be strongly influenced by non&#8208;covalent interactions such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair formation.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis, characterization and complexation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted MIIs (mesoionic imines) and their metal complexes. In the free MIIs, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between the imine&#8208;N and the C&#8722;H bonds of the ferrocenyl substituents both in the solid state and in solution. The influence of this hydrogen bonding is so strong that complexation of the MIIs with [IrCp*Cl2]2 yields unique six&#8208;membered iridacycles via C&#8722;H&#8208;activation of the corresponding C&#8722;H&#8208;site at the Fc&#8208;substituent and not the Ph&#8208;substituent. This result is in contrast to previous reports in which always a preferential C&#8722;H activation at the phenyl substituent is observed in competitive reactions in the presence of ferrocenyl substituents. The corresponding Ir complexes formed after in&#8208;situ halide exchange reaction exist in either [Ir&#8722;I] contact or as [Ir]+I&#8722; solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs depending on the solvent polarity. The iodide coordinated and solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs display drastically different physical properties. The TEP (Tolman&#8208;electronic&#8208;parameter) of these ligands was determined and lines up with previously reported MII&#8208;ligands. The redox properties were investigated by a combination of electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. We show here how non&#8208;covalent interactions can have a drastic influence on the physical and chemical properties of these new class of compounds.

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfect combination of nucleotide chemistry and enzyme catalysis. The work describes the efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic production of stable isotope labeled RNA building blocks. The synthetic route outcompetes previously reported procedures and makes the production of stable isotope labeled pseudouridine RNA building blocks economically reasonable.







Abstract
Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to pseudouridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63&#8197;nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI&#8208;labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.

         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;Substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes undergo electrocyclization followed by elimination of phenylsulfinic acid, both in the gas phase, to give (4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls during sublimation. Pure, high&#8208;quality single crystals of the product grow in the desublimation area. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1,6-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-Substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes&lt;/b&gt; undergo electrocyclization followed by elimination of phenylsulfinic acid, both in the gas phase, to give (4-phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls during sublimation. Pure, high-quality single crystals of the product grow in the desublimation area. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new atomistic model called MechaPredict uses DFT to predict the Young's modulus of crystal surfaces to within numerical accuracy. Within a computer, a crystal surface experiences mechanical stress leading to an accurate estimate of the surface mechanical properties. Crucially, unlike the existing experimental nanoindentation technique, which must be done serially on one crystal facet at a time, MechaPredict can perform multiple computations for multiple crystals and their facets. In the cover image, only one CPU core is being used, leaving the impression that the unused CPU cores can be used to perform additional high&#8208;throughput computations of dozens of crystal surfaces, saving time, effort and money in the quest for the discovery of new mechanically responsive molecular crystals. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;C. Sun, S. Mohamed and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400779).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework PCN&#8208;224 Combined Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles for Hypoxia Relief and Synergistic Photodynamic/Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a tumor targeted nanoplatform (PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA). HA can specifically target 4T1 cells and Co3O4 can produce oxygen in&#8197;situ to alleviate the hypoxic environment of the tumor. This nanosystem presents reliable biosafety performance, and can combine with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are promising tumor treatments mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have the advantages of being minimally invasive. However, the hypoxia of tumor microenvironment and poor target ability often reduce the therapeutic effect. Here we propose a tumor targeted nanoplatform PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA for enhanced PDT and synergistic CDT, constructed by hyaluronate&#8208;modified Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224. Co3O4 can catalyze the decomposition of highly expressed H2O2 in tumor cells to produce oxygen and alleviate the problem of hypoxia. It can also produce hydroxyl radicals according to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction for chemical dynamic therapy, significantly improving the therapeutic effect. The cell survival experiment showed that after in&#8197;vitro treatment, 4T1 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells died in a large area under the anaerobic state, while the survival ability of normal cell L02 was nearly unchanged. This result effectively indicated that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA could effectively relieve tumor hypoxia and improve the effect of PDT and synergistic CDT. Cell uptake experiments showed that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA had good targeting properties and could effectively aggregate in tumor cells. In vivo experiments on mice, PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA presented reliable biosafety performance, and can cooperate with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Encumbered Boron Lewis Acid Enabled by an Organotellurium&#8208;Based Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new boron Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 combines one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres with a Lewis acidity comparable to that of B(C6F5)3. It additionally provides ligand transfer reactivity towards fluoride compounds as shown in the synthesis of an Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine species.







Abstract
Lewis acidic boron compounds are ubiquitous in chemistry due to their numerous applications, yet tuning and optimizing their properties towards different purposes is still a challenging field of research. In this work, the boron&#8208;based Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 was synthesized by reaction of the teflate derivative HOTeF3(C6F5)2 with BCl3 or BCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. This new compound presents a remarkably high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, as well as one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres known in the literature. Theoretical and experimental methods revealed that B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 exhibits a comparable Lewis acidity to that of the well&#8208;known B(C6F5)3. The affinity of B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 towards pyridine was accessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and compared to that of B(OTeF5)3 and B(C6F5)3. The ligand&#8208;transfer reactivity of this new boron compound towards different fluorides was demonstrated by the formation of an anionic Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine(III) species.

Theoretical and experimental methods revealed that B[OTeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a comparable Lewis acidity to that of the well-known B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The affinity of B[OTeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; towards pyridine was accessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and compared to that of B(OTeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The ligand-transfer reactivity of this new boron compound towards different fluorides was demonstrated by the formation of an anionic Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine(III) species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mechanistic Spectrum of O&#8722;H Bond Cleavage Observed for Reactions of Phenols with a Manganese Superoxo Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of MnIII(BDPBrP)(O2&#8901;) (1) with Me2NPhOH and NO2PhOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceed via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) and proton transfer (PT) to produce MnIII(BDPBrP)(OOH) (2) and [MnIV(BDPBrP)(OOH)]+ (3), respectively. Intriguingly, two routes of CPET and sequential PT and electron transfer (ET) were invoked for the reactions of 1 with ClPhOH and MeOPhOH to ultimately generate 2.







Abstract
Reaction of a rare and well&#8208;characterized MnIII&#8208;superoxo species, Mn(BDPBrP)(O2&#8901;) (1, H2BDPBrP=2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;bromo)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)methyl)pyridine), with 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenol at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceeds via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) to produce a MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, Mn(BDPBrP)(OOH) (2), alongside 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenoxy radical; whereas, upon treatment with 4&#8208;nitrophenol, complex 1 undergoes a proton transfer process to afford a MnIV&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [Mn(BDPBrP)(OOH)]+ (3). Intriguingly, the reactions of 1 with 4&#8208;chlorophenol and 4&#8208;methoxyphenol follow two routes of CPET and sequential proton and electron transfer to furnish complex 2 in the end. UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopic studies coupled with DFT calculations provided support for this wide mechanistic spectrum of activating various phenol O&#8722;H bonds by a single MnIII&#8208;superoxo complex, 1.

         <title>Exploration of Vitamin B6&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Pyridinium Salts Towards the Application in Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts was prepared from pyridoxal hydrochloride. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions with the redox wave corresponding to a two&#8208;electron process. Under the bulk electrolysis conditions, the reduction via consecutive electron transfer (ET) and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) follows by a proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol product.







Abstract
Pyridoxal hydrochloride, a vitamin B6 vitamer, was synthetically converted to a series of diverse redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions, and two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory&#8208;scale flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10&#8197;mM in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH. In these tests, the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two&#8208;electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol. 1H&#8197;NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept inspired by playing with blocks, in which it is possible to construct various objects from segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. An attempt is made to explain the mechanism of coupling reaction in a ball mill in the presence of cesium carbonate. The usefulness of the method in the synthesis of oligopeptides has been proven.







Abstract
We report an idea for the synthesis of oligopeptides using a solvent&#8208;free ball milling approach. Our concept is inspired by block play, in which it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. We prove that by having a library of short peptides and employing the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily coupled to form different oligopeptides with the desired functional and biological properties. Optimizing the BMMS process we found that the best yields we obtained when TBTU and cesium carbonate were used as reagents. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed on each stage of synthesis by 1H, 13C and 133Cs NMR employing Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) techniques. It was found that cesium carbonate acts not only as a base but is also responsible for the activation of substrates and intermediates. The unique information about the BMMS mechanism is based on the analysis of 2D NMR data. The power of BMMS is proved by the example of different peptide combinations, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2 and 4+4. The tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octapeptides obtained under this project were fully characterized by MS and NMR techniques.

         <title>Photo/Mechanical/Acidic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responses and Information Encryption Design of Acylhydrazone Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polymorphs of acylhydrazone derivative are prepared, the mechanisms of their photo/mechanical/acidic multi&#8208;stimuli responses are investigated, and an information encryption system based on photochromism and acidochromism is developed.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials have received much attention for being potential candidates of smart materials. However, the occurrence of polymorphism&#8208;driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N&#8242;&#8208;[(E)&#8208;(1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methylidene] pyridine &#8722;4&#8208;carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form&#8208;1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form&#8208;1. The solid&#8208;melt&#8208;solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid&#8208;solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form&#8208;2 to form&#8208;3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form&#8208;2 and form&#8208;3 provides a structural basis for the grinding&#8208;induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acidochromic property. The combination of photochromism and acidochromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.

Form-1 undergoes a photomechanical response via &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form-1. The solid-melt-solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid-solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form-2 to form-3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form-2 and form-3 provides a structural basis for the grinding-induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acidochromic property. The combination of photochromism and acidochromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study describes the synthesis of Ni single atom containing N&#8208;doped porous hollow carbon nanospheres and explores its supercapacitive properties. An optimized Ni doping, surface area and graphitization improves its electrical conductivity leading to superior charge storage performance. It displays remarkable capacitance with outstanding energy and power density and long cycle life.







Abstract
Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO3)2/phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The microstructure and surface area vary with the amount of Ni(NO3)2 employed in the syntheses and the carbonization environment. An optimized amount of nickel and argon as the carbonization gas afford Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar which possesses overall superior features. The uniformly dispersed Ni single atoms within the hollow porous carbon framework fully utilize all the electroactive sites thereby improving the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar reaches 777&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;% and excellent recyclability. The energy and power density of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar are found to be high; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 its energy density is 155.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 600.3&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. At a high current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 the material shows a high energy density of 118.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with excellent power density of 6003.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. A symmetric solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with this material, Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar//Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar using H2SO4/PVA gel electrolyte shows a superior energy density value of 30&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1200&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Strategies to Design Chemocatalytic Racemization of Tertiary Alcohols: State of the Art &amp; Utilization for Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the challenging field of racemizing tertiary alcohols, recently different concepts were developed. Suitable catalysts for efficient racemization and suppressing unwanted side&#8208;reactions were found. Besides Br&#248;nsted acids, oxovanadium complexes and piperidine turned out to be useful catalysts. The latter two types proved to be compatible with a lipase, thus leading to the first examples of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically pure tertiary alcohols is an important issue in organic synthesis of a range of pharmaceuticals including molecules such as the anti&#8208;HIV drug Efavirenz. A conceptually elegant approach to such enantiomers is the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic tertiary alcohols, which, however, requires efficient racemization strategies. The racemization of tertiary alcohols is particularly challenging due to various side reactions that can occur because of their high tendency for elimination reactions. In the last few years, several complementary catalytic concepts for racemization of tertiary alcohols have been developed, characterized by efficient racemization and suppression of unwanted side&#8208;reactions. Besides resins bearing sulfonic acid moieties and a combination of boronic acid and oxalic acid as heterogeneous and homogeneous Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, respectively, immobilized oxovanadium and piperidine turned out to be useful catalysts. The latter two catalysts, which have already been applied to different types of substrates, also have proven good compatibility with lipase, thus leading to the first two examples of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols. In this review, the difficulties in racemizing tertiary alcohols are specifically described, and the recently developed complementary concepts to overcome these hurdles are summarized.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and simple mechanical bond strategy can significantly enhance the fluorescence of pyrenes in the solid state with a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect. More importantly, it is found that the originally impure emission of pyrene can be purified to a single emission after the modification of mechanical bond.







Abstract
To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. Moreover, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterisation, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from mechanical bond induced refinement of molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nanoparticles to Perform Reactions in Suspension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) are prepared in THF. Based on their high reactivity, they are used as a starting material in the liquid phase for reaction with sterically demanding ligands, resulting in C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions and five novel coordination compounds.







Abstract
Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr2 either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]).

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) are prepared in THF. Based on their high reactivity, they are used as a starting material in the liquid phase for reaction with sterically demanding ligands, resulting in C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions and five novel coordination compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]-driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) than [LiNaph]-driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#8197;nm). The as-prepared Mg(0) nanoparticles are monocrystalline (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;101&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=245&#177;5&#8197;pm) for both types of reduction. Their reactivity is probed by liquid-phase reaction (THF, toluene) in suspension near room temperature (20&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) with 1-bromoadamantane (AdBr), chlortriphenylsilane (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl), trichlorphenylsilane (PhSiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 9H-carbazole (Hcbz), 7-azaindole (Hai), 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;nda) and N,N&#8217;-bis(&#945;-pyridyl)-2,6-diaminopyridine (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;tpda) as exemplary starting materials. The reactions result in the formation of 1,1&#8217;-biadamantane (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#215;Ph&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), [Mg&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [Mg(cbz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), [Mg&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O(ai)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#215;1.5&#8197;C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), [Mg&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;nda)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) and [Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(tpda)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) with 40&#8211;80&#8201;% yield. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; show the reactivity of Mg(0) nanoparticles for C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions with sterically demanding starting materials. &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; represent new coordination compounds using sterically demanding N&#8722;H-acidic amines as starting materials. The formation of multinuclear Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with multidentate ligands illustrates the potential of the oxidative approach to obtain novel compounds with Mg(0) nanoparticles in the liquid phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
