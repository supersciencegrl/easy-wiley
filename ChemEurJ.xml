         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132} Cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral resolution of racemic amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) has been achieved by using a chirally coordinated enantiopure polyoxometalate host, {Mo132(lactate)30}. NMR spectroscopic methods, including DOSY measurements, were applied to determine the enantiomeric excesses of guest mixtures in addition to the association constants of the host&#8208;guest system binding process.







Abstract
Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents interact noncovalently with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy; this is then reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules has been synthesised. By exploiting the interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores, the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent was establish and their enantiomeric excess was determined by 1H NMR using shifts of &#916;&#916;&#948;=0.06&#8197;ppm. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of a class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.

         <title>Polymer Nanodiscs and Their Bioanalytical Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovering discs: Although understanding membrane protein (MP) structure and activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with purification and analysis of MPs. Synthetic polymer nanodiscs, structures that arise from amphipathic copolymers capturing membrane proteins and surrounding phospholipids, offer a convenient detergent&#8208;free solution. This review explores the scope of possible analytical applications for polymer nanodiscs in the study of MPs and biomolecules.







Abstract
Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into the historical developments that became the prelude to currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid ring. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials is presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8211;protein interactions, and the functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.

         <title>Triplet Exciton Upconverting Blue Exciplex Host for Deep Blue Phosphors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopping diodes from dying: A TADF exciplex host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to improve the efficiency and device lifetime of blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A higher external quantum efficiency of over 20&#8201;% and doubled device lifetime with deep blue color coordinate were realized in the blue phosphorescent OLEDs by using the new exciplex host system.







Abstract
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type exciplex host employing a novel electron&#8208;transport type (n&#8208;type) type host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN&#8208;modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF&#8208;type exciplex host&#8208;based blue PhOLEDs showed high (above 20&#8201;%) quantum efficiency with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex&#8208;free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach a long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.

Dynamically 1D assembled linear Pd8 chains with bisisocyanide linkers are shown against a backdrop of contrails lit from below by the rising sun. A variety of Pd8 chains with a linear tetraphosphine, meso&#8208;dpmppm, were synthesized through both covalent and noncovalent interactions between two Pd4 fragments. They exhibited fine&#8208;tunable electronic states, a wide range of redox properties, and dynamic 1D self&#8208;assembly in solution. These findings could lead to the next frontier in exploring new functions with dynamically aggregated metal building blocks. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Tanase et&#8197;al.

         <title>Ytterbium (II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular ytterbium(II) hydride enables the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene to provide an inverse sandwich diytterbium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative and hydrogen gas. This reactivity was extended to the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V), with retention of metal oxidation state. This reactivity proceeds via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation pathways that occurs at the dimeric hydride reagent.







Abstract
A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium (II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two&#8208;electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.

These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two-electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphtha was separated by using a easily attainable metal&#8211;organic framework, Co3(HCOO)6, through selective molecular exclusion of alkane isomers with different degrees of branching. The separation capability of the compound was evaluated by using naphtha mixtures with 180+ hydrocarbon components. Co3(HCOO)6 exhibited efficient separation of the mixture and thus yielded products with high octane ratings and high dynamic capacity. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Wang, Q. Gong, J. Li, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101871).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aetokthonotoxin, the Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin Causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing the &#8220;wanted&#8221; bald eagle killer: Aetokthonotoxin (AETX), a pentabrominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole alkaloid has been indicted to elicit vacuolar myelinopathy, a neurologic disease causing the death of birds of prey, such as the bald eagle in the USA. In order to assess further biological activity studies, synthesis of this neurotoxin is decidedly needed. Here, we describe its first total synthesis: by fusing advanced indole intermediates in a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction in only five steps overall. More information can be found in the Communication by M.&#8197;G. Ricardo, B. Westermann, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101848).

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation plus the droplet formation of proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, but there is also evidence linking it to a variety of medical conditions. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via such droplet condensation. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, stabilizing the droplet phase and preventing conversion to the toxic fibrillar state. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Oliva, R. Winter, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101592).

         <title>A full flexible NH4+&#160; ion battery based on the concentrated hydrogel electrolyte for enhanced performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal ammonium&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of NH  4  +  &#160;ion&#160;redox chemistry&#160;in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#183;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference,&#160;AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121 mAh g&#8208;1&#160; and capacity retention of 95% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160;&#8208;1. The full flexible AIBs are then fabricated using hydrogel electrolytes with varied salt concentrations, to maximize the electrochemical performance. It is found that the battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3 M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance&#160;i.e., a capacity of 60 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;while maintaining a capacity retention of 88% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160; &#8208;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for future developments of new electrochemical energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60  . In this work, we investigate the fundamental processes within these hybrids. Variation of the linker&#8208;unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8208; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC &#8211; C60  distance of up to 14.2 &#197;. By comparing the NBD &#8208; QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibited superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic lanthanide&#8208;coinage metal compounds featuring possible metal&#8208;metal interactions in the exited state</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic complexes, combining metals at the outer rim of the d&#8208;block, e.g. lanthanides(III) (Ln) and coinage metals(I) (M) are scarcely reported, synthetically challenging and highly interesting in terms of their interaction. In this context, we synthesized heterobimetallic Ln&#8208;M compounds ligated by the amidinate system (N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl]formamidinate, dpfam). The resulting compounds [dpfam  3  LnM][OTf] (Ln = La, Nd and M = Ag, Au) feature a close proximity of the two metal centers and were investigated experimentally by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The latter showed rare La&#8208;Au interactions for the first excited state.</dc:description>

Comparison with the  mono  &#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the  bis  &#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of  Cat  1+  ,  Cat  2+  ,  Cat(i)  2+  , and  Cat  3+  with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Cata&#8208;Annulated Azaacene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How high can you go? Cata&#8208;annulation of dicarboximides onto azaacenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and increases reduction potentials up to &#8722;0.35&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+, but does not stabilize a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene which dimerized regioselectively to its butterfly adduct.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient azaacenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes with chlorinated mellophanic diimide followed by oxidation of the intermediate N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydro compounds with MnO2 or PbO2. The resulting cata&#8208;annulated bisimide azaacenes have ultrahigh electron affinities with first reduction potentials as low as &#8722;0.35&#8197;V recorded for a tetraazapentacene. Attempts to prepare a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene resulted in the formation of a symmetric butterfly dimer.

         <title>Allenes and Dienes as Chiral Allylmetal Pronucleophiles in Catalytic Enantioselective C=X Addition: Historical Perspective and State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Survey</title>

Beyond preformed allylmetal reagents: In this review, the emerging use of allenes and dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X (X=C, O, N) electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued.







Abstract
The use of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in intermolecular catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued together with redox&#8208;neutral hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer processes. Coverage is limited to processes that result in both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond formation. The use of alkynes as latent allylmetal pronucleophiles and multicomponent C=X allylations involving allenes and dienes is not covered. As illustrated in this review, the ability of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes to serve as tractable non&#8208;metallic pronucleophiles has evoked many useful transformations that have no counterpart in traditional allylmetal chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;The use of allenes and 1,3-dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in intermolecular catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued together with redox-neutral hydrogen auto-transfer processes. Coverage is limited to processes that result in both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond formation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST = ESinglet &#8722; ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8208;R; Pn = P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8208;PH2 (&#8722;3.2 kcal mol&#8208;1) and P&#8208;NH2 (&#8722;0.2 kcal mol&#8208;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8208;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetalation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Redox&#8208;transmetalation is the key: NHC complexes of divalent lanthanides (Sm, Eu, Yb) and alkaline&#8208;earth metals (Ca, Sr) have been accessed by a redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy from NHC&#8208;AgI complexes, a viable procedure when the classical and non&#8208;redox transmetalation methodology fails to proceed. Trends in the bonding of the NHC ligands were established from a detailed experimental and computational analysis.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetalation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8208;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. By using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI2(IMe)4] (Ln=Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI2(IMe)2(THF)2] (M=Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in the NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI2(IMes)(THF)3], while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI2(THF)4] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI2(IMe)2(THF)2] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI2(IMe)4]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both arrangements are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;Toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge are found to provide insulation of ionic dyes, thus preventing their aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in polymeric nanoparticles. Their chemical structure defines dye encapsulation, particle brightness and on/off switching. Compared to currently used anions, C&#8208;acyl barbiturates are non&#8208;toxic, while offering chemical availability and versatility.







Abstract
Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.

         <title>(NH4)2V7O16 Microbricks as a Novel Anode for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with Good Cyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recharging your batteries: Brick&#8208;like (NH4)2V7O16, which features an open&#8208;layered structure with two NH4+ ions residing in the V7O16 layers, undergoes ammonium ion extraction and insertion processes during cycling. Two novel full cell systems, (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 and (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 (shown), both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance, thus suggesting that the layered (NH4)2V7O16 could be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Searching for novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH4)2V7O16 with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li+/Na+ hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 and (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. A capacity retention of 78.61&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 was demonstrated in the (NH4)2V7O16||Li2SO4||LiMn2O4 system, whereas no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH4)2V7O16||Na2SO4||LiMn2O4 system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH4)2V7O16 electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells were also researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that layered (NH4)2V7O16 can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

These high&#8208;energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (68.8&#8208;76.9%) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62&#8208;1.88 g cm  &#8208;3  ), very high enthalpies of formation (846&#8208;1720 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66&#8208;9.09 km s  &#8208;1  and detonation pressures 25.0&#8208;37.7 GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4&#8208;triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.</dc:description>

         <title>Umbelliferone Decorated Water&#8208;soluble Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines &#8211; In Vitro Phototoxic Antimicrobial Anti&#8208;cancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution we report on the synthesis, characterization and application of water&#8209;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines which are decorated with four or eight umbelliferone moieties for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds are linked peripherally to zinc(II) phthalocyanine by a tri(ethylene glycol) linker attached to pyridines, leading to cationic pyridinium units, able to increase the water solubility of the system. Beside their photophysical properties they were analyzed concerning their cellular distribution in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells as well as their phototoxicity towards HepG2 cells, Gram&#8209;positive (S. aureus 3150/12 and B. subtilis DB104) and Gram&#8209;negative bacteria (E. coli UTI89 and E. coli Nissle 1917). At low light doses and concentrations, they exhibit superb antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8209;positive bacteria as well as anti&#8209;tumor activity against HepG2. They are even capable to inactivate Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the dark toxicity remains low. These unique water&#8209;soluble compounds can be regarded as all&#8208;in&#8208;one type photosensitizers with broad applications ranges in the future.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of weak and inexpensive bases has recently opened promising perspectives towards the simpler and more sustainable synthesis of Au(I)&#8208;aryl complexes with valuable applications in catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. In recent years, continuous manufacturing has shown to be a reliable partner in establishing sustainable and controlled process scalability. Herein, the first continuous flow synthesis of a range of Au(I)&#8208;aryl starting from widely available boronic acids and various [Au(NHC)Cl] (NHC =  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes in unprecedentedly short reaction times and high yields is reported. Successful synthesis of previously non&#8208; or poorly accessible complexes exposed fascinating reactivity patterns. Via a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, convenient process scalability of the developed protocol was showcased.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Butylated Hydroxytoluene: A Functional Group Tolerant, Eco&#8208;Friendly Base for Solvent&#8208;Free, Pd&#8208;Catalysed Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green amination: Sodium butylated hydroxytoluene (NaBHT) has been shown to be a highly efficient base for the solvent&#8208;free (melt) amination of a wide variety of substrates, including those containing base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups.







Abstract
NaBHT (sodium 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenolate), a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high&#8208;reactivity Pd&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent&#8208;free (melt) cross&#8208;coupling amination. The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti&#8208;oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mol percent catalyst. Comparisons using the standard base for this reaction, KOtBu, led to poor couplings or complete degradation in most applications &#8211; only NaBHT works.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles Based on Co&#8208;Functionalization with Zwitterionic and Cationic Binding Motifs**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au nanoparticles co&#8208;functionalized with guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate zwitterions (GCPZ) and guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylates (GCP) show a a multi&#8208;pH&#8208;controlled and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly in water. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the Au nanoparticles possess seven alternating regimes in which they are assembled/disassembled, simply controlled by pH and temperature.







Abstract
We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH&#8197;1, pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;13, whereas they disassemble at pH&#8197;3 and pH&#8197;11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH&#8197;1 and pH&#8197;13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.

When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self-assemble at pH&#8197;1, pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;13, whereas they disassemble at pH&#8197;3 and pH&#8197;11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH&#8197;1 and pH&#8197;13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor bearing a bidentate disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, was grafted on silica supports by substitution reaction on silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand to selectively form bis&#8208;grafted surface species.







Abstract
Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface. Herein, we introduce a metal complex bearing bidentate disilicate ligands, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, as a molecular precursor, which has a silicate framework adjacent to the metal (Pt) center. The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and tBuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and 195Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.

         <title>Strategy of Graphdiyne (g&#8722;CnH2n&#8208;2 ) Preparation Coupling with the Flower&#8208;Like NiAl&#8208;LDH Heterjunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution**

Graphdyine nanosheets were synthesized successfully by employing cross&#8208;coupling method with CuI as the catalyst and the composite copper iodide&#8208;graphdyine (CuI&#8208;GD) composite was coupled with the flower&#8208;like layered double hydroxide (NiAl&#8208;LDH) to construct an S&#8208;scheme for producing H2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The spherical flower&#8208;like NiAl&#8208;LDH can support CuI&#8208;GD to prevent it from aggregation. A greatly improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was obtained in the sensitized system.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (g&#8722;CnH2n&#8208;2), a novel two&#8208;dimension carbon allotrope material composed of a sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybrid carbon network, has been widely explored since it was synthesized for the first time by Li's group in 2010. A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields. Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu+ contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI&#8208;GD is coupled with flower&#8208;like NiAl&#8208;LDH to produce H2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing a cross&#8208;coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH has a 15&#8208; and 216&#8208;fold enhancement compared with CuI&#8208;GD and NiAl&#8208;LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to understand the interaction among these materials.

A versatile method is presented for the direct N&#8208;arylation of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) providing a variety of functionalized derivatives.

Investigations on optical and redox properties led to valuable structure&#8208;property relationships. Further functionalization of an acceptor&#8208;substituted DTP yielded cruciform&#8208;type donor&#8722;acceptor oligomers, which were implemented into single material organic solar cells.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper substituted graphitic carbon nitride is shown to be a photoactive electrocatalyst for the two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO. Electrocatalytic activity as measured by yield and faradaic efficiency is increased upon irradiation with visible light. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra measured in the presence of visible light exhibit pronounced, &gt;1&#8197;eV, light&#8208;induced shifts to lower binding energies representing significant photoconductivity.







Abstract
Research on the photoreduction of CO2 often has been dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO2 reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8722;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO as a major product (&gt;95&#8201;%) and formic acid (&lt;5&#8201;%). The results show that at a potential of &#8722;2.5&#8197;V versus Fc\Fc+ the CO2 reduction activity of Cu&#8722;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25&#8201;% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%. Independently, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8722;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo&#8208;assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copper substituted graphitic&lt;/b&gt; carbon nitride is shown to be a photoactive electrocatalyst for the two-electron reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. Electrocatalytic activity as measured by yield and faradaic efficiency is increased upon irradiation with visible light. X-ray photoelectron spectra measured in the presence of visible light exhibit pronounced, &amp;gt;1&#8197;eV, light-induced shifts to lower binding energies representing significant photoconductivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on the photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; often has been dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper-substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8722;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two-electron reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO as a major product (&amp;gt;95&#8201;%) and formic acid (&amp;lt;5&#8201;%). The results show that at a potential of &#8722;2.5&#8197;V versus Fc\Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity of Cu&#8722;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25&#8201;% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%. Independently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8722;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo-assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tuneable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of timing: Phosphate&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers that are suitable for tuneable double cargo release allow 1) programmable slow&#8208;release of the one cargo in 3&#8197;hours, 2) simultaneous release of both cargos within 25&#8197;minutes or 3) sequential release of the first cargo within 15&#8197;minutes followed by the second cargo release within 3&#8197;hours. Optimised linkers are stable and could find further applications in the design of innovative materials and multiple&#8208;drug&#8208;delivery systems.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug&#8208;delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double&#8208;cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. A series of substituted phosphate linkers was designed for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1&#8197;day to 2&#8197;hours or 5&#8197;minutes, as shown for linkers containing p&#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing p&#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4&#8197;days, 4&#8197;hours, and 15&#8197;minutes) than their p&#8208;fluoro analogues. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25&#8197;minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New Complementary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaken, not stirred: Coating reductants onto glass beads simplifies &#956;mol&#8208;scale cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, enabling the rapid survey of 222 different reactions and the discovery of a new, useful catalyst. Although the reactions are heterogeneous, the glass beads enable the use of shakers instead of complex micro stirrers.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bonds are available, options for Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. By using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level with a challenging array of 3&#215;222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56&#8201;%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.

         <title>Germyliumylidene: A Versatile Low Valent Group 14 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile ambiphilic catalytic application of a bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene enables a range of reductive functionalization reactions, with a particular emphasis on C=O reduction that is, CO2 and carbonyls.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium center. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8722;CNHC &#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer=2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and arylsilane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls, thus highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.

         <title>A Chiral Lanthanide Tag for Stable and Rigid Attachment to Single Cysteine Residues in Proteins for NMR, EPR and Time&#8208;Resolved Luminescence Studies</title>

Lanthanoid keys to proteins: A stable chiral lanthanide(III) tag reacts spontaneously and quantitatively with a cysteine residue to generate a stable thioether bond. The lanthanide&#8208;binding tag presents a tool to probe proteins using multiple spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance and time&#8208;resolved FRET experiments.







Abstract
A lanthanide&#8208;binding tag site&#8208;specifically attached to a protein presents a tool to probe the protein by multiple spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy. Here a new stable chiral LnIII tag, referred to as C12, is presented for spontaneous and quantitative reaction with a cysteine residue to generate a stable thioether bond. The synthetic protocol of the tag is relatively straightforward, and the tag is stable for storage and shipping. It displays greatly enhanced reactivity towards selenocysteine, opening a route towards selective tagging of selenocysteine in proteins containing cysteine residues. Loaded with TbIII or TmIII ions, the C12 tag readily generates pseudocontact shifts (PCS) in protein NMR spectra. It produces a relatively rigid tether between lanthanide and protein, which is beneficial for interpretation of the PCSs by single magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensors, and it is suitable for measuring distance distributions in double electron&#8211;electron resonance experiments. Upon reaction with cysteine or other thiol compounds, the TbIII complex exhibits a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield, affording a highly sensitive turn&#8208;on luminescence probe for time&#8208;resolved FRET assays and enzyme reaction monitoring.

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni(II)&#8208;allyl complexes supported by bulky terphenyl phosphine ligands have been prepared and characterized. These complexes have been used as precatalysts in the formation of C&#8722;S bonds, allowing the efficient coupling between a variety of electrophiles, including aryl chlorides and, for the first time, tosylates, with aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Moreover, differentiated reactivity of the electrophilic partners enables tandem formation of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N bonds in a single step.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8722;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here, we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe2Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217;=terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated, demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8722;I bond in the presence of a C&#8722;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.

         <title>Comparative Nucleosomal Reactivity of 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;Uridine and 5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;Cytidine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The covalent adduct formation of the oxidative lesions and epigenetic bases 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) was investigated comparatively arguing that oxidative stress can have transcriptional consequences.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) are formyl&#8208;containing nucleosides that are created by oxidative stress in differentiated cells. While fdU is almost exclusively an oxidative stress lesion formed from deoxythymidine (T), the situation for fdC is more complex. Next to formation as an oxidative lesion, it is particularly abundant in stem cells, where it is more frequently formed in an epigenetically important oxidation reaction performed by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent TET enzymes from 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC). Recently, it was shown that genomic fdC and fdU can react with the &#1013;&#8208;aminogroups of nucleosomal lysines to give Schiff base adducts that covalently link nucleosomes to genomic DNA. Here, we show that fdU features a significantly higher reactivity towards lysine side chains compared with fdC. This result shows that depending on the amounts of fdC and fdU, oxidative stress may have a bigger impact on nucleosome binding than epigenetics.

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] possessing strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, large birefringence, and a wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region, has been obtained by the combination of [HCOO] groups and lead bromides. Interestingly, KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8722;Br layers containing coplanar Pb6Br6 rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs2[Pb2Br5 (HCOO)2], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method. KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5&#215;KDP), large birefringence (0.16@ 1064&#8197;nm), and a wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8722;Br layers containing coplanar Pb6Br6 rings are not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.

         <title>General, Straightforward, and Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Vinyl Triflimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be utilized to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on gram scale using both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed part of its unique chemical properties.







Abstract
Vinyl triflimides were only accessible recently and their chemistry is yet to be discovered. Herein, we describe a general, straightforward and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of these materials from alkynes and triflimide. A vast array of terminal and internal alkynes with broad spectrum of functionalities could be employed to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides regiospecifically with high to specific stereoselectivity. Moreover, the protocol could be conducted on gram scale using terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides revealed part of its chemical properties.

         <title>Structure Recovery and Recycling of the Used LiCoO2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, the recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, the industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO  2  materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO  2  material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8208;O bond length of 1.9134 nm, O&#8208;Co&#8208;O bond angle of 94.72&#186;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467 nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO  2  . In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO  2  material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO  2  with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls via the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by means of trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates have also been evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Lateral Metallation and Redistribution Reactions of Sodium Ferrates Containing Bulky 2,6&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali&#8208;metal&#160;ferrates containing amide groups have emerged as regioselective bases capable of promoting Fe&#8208;H exchanges of aromatic substrates. Advancing this area of heterobimetallic chemistry, a new series of sodium ferrates is introduced incorporating the bulky arylsilyl amido ligand N(SiMe3)(Dipp) (Dipp= 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by this amide, transamination of [NaFe(HMDS)3]&#160;(HMDS = N(SiMe3)2) with an excess of HN(SiMe3)(Dipp)&#160;led to the isolation of heteroleptic&#160;[Na(HMDS)2Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]&#8734;&#160;(1) resulting from the exchange of just one&#160;HMDS&#160;&#160;group. An alternative co&#8208;complexation approach, combining the homometallic metal amides [NaN(SiMe3)Dipp] and [Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}2] induces lateral metallation of one Me arm from the SiMe3&#160;group in the iron amide furnishing tetrameric&#160;[NaFe{N(SiCH2Me2)Dipp}{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]4&#160;(2). Reactivity studies support that this deprotonation is driven by the steric incompatibility of the single metal amides rather than the basic capability of the sodium reagent. Displaying synergistic reactivity, heteroleptic sodium ferrate&#160;1&#160;can selectively promote ferration of pentafluorobenzene using one of its HMDS arms to give heterotrileptic&#160;[Na{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)Fe(C6F5)]&#8734;&#160;(4).&#160;Attempts to deprotonate less activated pyridine led to the isolation of NaHMDS and heteroleptic Fe(II) amide&#160;[(py)Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)] (5),&#160;resulting from an alternative redistribution process which is favoured by the Lewis donor ability of this substrate.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a on the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated perylenes (  1  &#8208;  4  ) alternating amide and ester groups in their molecular structure. We found that the LC properties of these compounds does not only depends on the number of hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound&#160;  1  &#160;leads to no LC properties, while the use of four amide groups induces the formation of long temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound&#160;  4  . Remarkably, compound&#160;  3,  &#160;bearing two amide groups in the inner part of the structure stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer&#160;  2  , with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. In the same direction, we found that only compounds&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  , with no H&#8208;bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>

         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we have successfully synthesized  a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [  (C  6  H  5  NF  3  )  (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF  4  ]  (1)  , which shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348 K (heating) and 331 K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, indicating that  1  undergoes a reversible structural phase transition.  The variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of  1  . The second harmonic response demonstrates that  1  belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. Meanwhile,  1  shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43 eV in semiconducting property and is chiefly contributed by C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of  1  exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with large spontaneous polarization (  P  s  ) of about 4.06  &#956;C/  cm  2  . This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208; inorganic and other hybrid crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Directional Terthiazole&#8208;Based Switch: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular switches are key elements for the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive systems and materials. Of particular interest are switches that can be fully operated both by light and electricity, the two most popular inputs. It is shown for the first time that a terarylene photoswitch can be effectively transformed to an efficient photo and redox one when decorated with the electroactive N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group. The driving forces behind different switching processes are revealed by a joint experimental and theoretical approach.







Abstract
Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like an N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors were investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700&#8197;mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability, which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.

Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700&#8197;mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox-active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability, which, instead, got improved for the ring-opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Zeolitic Vanadotungstates with Ultrahigh Porosities for Separation of Butane and Isobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on vanadotungstates with different cations were successfully obtained and characterized. They efficiently separated n&#8208;butane from n&#8208;butane and i&#8208;butane mixtures. Single&#8208;gas adsorption measurements showed that the adsorbed volume of n&#8208;butane was much larger than that of i&#8208;butane. Breakthrough measurements showed that the materials efficiently achieved the separation of n&#8208;butane and i&#8208;butane, which was environmental friendly and cost&#8208;efficiently.







Abstract
Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both  ab initio  valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8208;95.2 kJ/mol at the EEF strength 0.005 a.u..</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroarenes Utilizing Amide Solvent as Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was realized by using N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine as a catalyst under UV light irradiation. This reaction does not necessitate aliphatic amine additives as sacrificial reductants. The mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays a critical role as a hydrogen and electron donor for this photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved by using N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine (1) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug&#8217;s cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been&#160;available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared  via  CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based materials, with high theoretical capacities and abundant reversible multi&#8208;electron redox properties, are considered as promising candidates in lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the poor electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte limited their practical applications. Herein, a double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C nanofiber (PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C, where PMo  12  is [PMo  12  O  40  ]  3&#8208;  , N&#8208;C is nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) was fabricated for the first time by combining coaxial electrospinning technique, thermal treatment and electrostatic adsorption. As an anode material for LIBs, the PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C delivered an excellent specific capacity of 1641 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 1000 cycles under 2 A g  &#8208;1  . The excellent electrochemical performance benefit from the unique double&#8208;shelled hollow structure of the material, in which the outermost N&#8208;C shell cannot only hinder the agglomeration of PMo  12  , but also improve its electronic conductivity. The SiO  2  inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion accelerate Li  +  diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, PMo  12  can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and facilitate electron transfer of the entire composites, as evidenced by the EIS kinetics study and lithium&#8208;ion diffusion analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of novel POM&#8208;based LIBs anode materials with excellent lithium storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photo&#8208;driven CH4 Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane (CH  4  ) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges under sustainable process remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst  via  topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100  o  C. The catalyst can remarkably activate CH  4  coupling to produce C  2  H  6  with a selectivity of 41.60% within 3 h under a full&#8208;spectrum irradiation when calcination of LDH at 800  o  C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst enable surface activation of CH  4  to methyl (CH  3  *), in turn promoting the coupling of CH  3  * to C  2  H  6  . This study introduces a promising pathway for the photo&#8208;driven CH  4  coupling to high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Storage Mechanism Study of N&#8208;doped Carbon Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the high specific capacity and abundant reserve, Cu  x  S compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize Cu  x  S structure, and to repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li  +  storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu  2  S is synthesized via CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction is employed to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu  2  S/carbon is elucidated by  operando  synchrotron radiation diffraction and  in situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon composited Cu  2  S (Cu  2  S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8211;1  , with the higher long&#8208;term capacity of 523 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8211;1  after 200 cycles, in contrast to the bare CuS electrode (123 mAh g  &#8211;1  after 200 cycles). Also, multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li  +  storage is mainly ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.</dc:description>

K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group . [Fe  III  O  5  ] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe  2  O  9  ] groups as well as two of their edges with [Te  VI  O  6  ] octahedra to form an open framework, which consists of two loosely connected but not interpenetrating chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar as for LiNbO  3  .The potassium cations are mobile in channels, which run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and are crossing in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K  12+6x  Fe  6  Te  4&#8211;x  O  27  is 2.3&#183;10  &#8211;4  S&#183;cm  &#8211;1  at room&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br  &#8208;  ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry, which have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs is only little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO  2  group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the  N  ,  N  &#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented  E  /  Z  &#8208;isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; ATI anion (i.e. without directional bonding to a metal atom). Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first  N,N  coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;peptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the Peptide Nucleic Acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient entropy&#8208;driven inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase III by hydroxyethylene transition state peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, we could show that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, we report the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#181;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.</dc:description>

The investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2&#8208;insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron&#8208;donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[  a,j]phenazine&#8208;cored D&#8211;A&#8211;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation.

         <title>Carbon dioxide capture enhanced by pre&#8208;adsorption of water and methanol in UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activity is one of the greatest environmental problems facing our civilization today. Most technologies are not yet sufficiently developed to move existing infrastructure to cleaner alternatives. Therefore, techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from emission sources may play a key role at the moment. The structure of the UiO&#8208;66 material not only meets the requirement of high stability in contact with water vapor but through the water pre adsorbed in the pores, the selectivity of carbon dioxide adsorption is increased. We successfully applied the recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling. It allowed to elucidate the influence of water on CO  2  adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We showed that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO  2  adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. Water plays a role of a mediator of adsorption, what is a general idea of improving affinity of adsorbate. On the basis of pre&#8208;adsorption of methanol as another polar solvent, we have shown that the adsorption sites play a key role here, and not, as previously thought, only the interaction between the solvent and quadrupole carbon dioxide. Overall, we explained the mechanism of increased CO  2  adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report for the first time a multichannel strategy to realize ternary state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic subnanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with muiltilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2 = 1:10:10  3  ), and high ternary yield (75%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DP  TPAZ+TAPB  can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after bending for 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a high temperature of 300 &#176;C. The results in this work are envisioned to open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangement for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal Organic Colloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because it is the fundamental component of living organism, but also for its unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by utilizing chiral physical field, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between this dynamic chiroptical property and the rheological nature was discussed, suggesting the shear thinning property of non&#8208;Newton fluid may help the colloidal particles adopt the chiral arrangement in the vortex. Further, the storage modulus of colloids was increased by adding linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical property in the static state. Besides, the salt effect on the host&#8208;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, suggesting the significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Meta&#8208;Halophenols by Anion&#8208;Accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclic Ring Opening</title>

Opening the way to densely functionalized natural products: We report the first anion&#8208;accelerated, thermally allowed, 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening as a novel route to substituted phenols 6&#8201;a&#8211;r and prove its efficacy in the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate).







Abstract
Disrotatory &#8211; thermally allowed &#8211; 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature to give the corresponding meta&#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8211;92&#8201;% yield, average: 65&#8201;%). Many of the phenols have unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was shown by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated in an ab initio study, which concluded that base&#8208;mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the meta&#8208;halophenol.

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism by Using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes with Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>

Going radical: Valence tautomerism between diamagnetic ferrocene&#8208;triarylmethylium and ferrocenium&#8208;triarylmethyl diradical species was purposefully introduced by carefully selecting the organic tritylium&#8208;type substituent so that its reduction potential was reasonably close to that for oxidation of the ferrocenyl constituent. The diradical valence tautomer and the paramagnetic reduced ferrocenyl&#8208;triarylmethyl complexes were found to dimerize extensively, as verified by spin counting via quantitative EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (1&#8201;a+, 1&#8201;b+) or thioxanthylium (1&#8201;c+) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism (VT). UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers 1&#8201;a..+&#8211;1&#8201;c..+ alongside diamagnetic forms 1&#8201;a+&#8211;1&#8201;c+, which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches. The diradical forms 1&#8201;a..+&#8211;1&#8201;c..+ as well as the one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced triarylmethyl forms of the complexes were found to dimerize in solution. For radical 1&#8201;a., dimerization occurs on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry; this allowed us to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for this process by digital simulation. M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy indicated that 1&#8201;a+ and 1&#8201;b+ retain VT even in the solid state. UV/Vis/NIR spectro&#8208;electrochemistry revealed the poly&#8208;electrochromic behaviour of these complexes by establishing the distinctly different electronic absorption profiles of the corresponding oxidized and reduced forms.

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10979-10986, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new N&#8208;heterocyclic alkynyl hypervalent iodine reagents have been synthesized. Their structures and reactivity are described and compared to already reported cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents, showing less extended &#963; holes for tosylated reagents. Good alkyne transfer properties towards strong nucleophiles were observed, but applications in radical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes were more limited.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, the synthesis of new N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds is reported. Solid&#8208;state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8722;Calkyne bond lengths allowed assessing the trans&#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the O&#8208;based EBX reagents.

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10948-10956, July 26, 2021. </description>

Pd/OCNT is deactivated during the transfer hydrogenation of phenol with formic acid to cyclohexanone because of the full coverage of formate on Pd. By comparison, Pd/NCNT is highly active and selective in the transfer hydrogenation and deactivation does not occur. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the transfer hydrogenation with the adsorbed formate on Pd.







Abstract
Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H2 or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Induced Polarization Destabilizes the Noncovalent Interactions of N&#8208;Methylated Lysines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 11005-11014, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation of ammonium weakens its electrostatic attraction with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. The weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be widely present.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methylation of ammonium weakens its electrostatic attraction&lt;/b&gt; with protein functional groups - salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation-&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;&lt;i&gt;kT&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl-enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be widely present.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Stabilization of a Charge Transfer State is the Key to Ultrafast Triplet State Formation in an Epigenetic DNA Nucleoside</title>

The ultrafast excited&#8208;state relaxation mechanisms of the epigenetic nucleoside 5fdCyd are revealed. Upon exposure to UV light, solvent&#8208;dependent charge transfer state&#8208;induced intersystem crossing is direct observed by TRIR and QM calculation.







Abstract
2&#8217;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;formylcytidine (5fdCyd), a naturally occurring nucleoside found in mammalian DNA and mitochondrial RNA, exhibits important epigenetic functionality in biological processes. Because it efficiently generates triplet excited states, it is an endogenous photosensitizer capable of damaging DNA, but the intersystem crossing (ISC) mechanism responsible for ultrafast triplet state generation is poorly understood. In this study, time&#8208;resolved mid&#8208;IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations reveal the distinct ultrafast ISC mechanisms of 5fdCyd in water versus acetonitrile. Our experiment indicates that in water, ISC to triplet states occurs within 1&#8197;ps after 285&#8197;nm excitation. PCM&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT computations suggest that this ultrafast ISC is mediated by a singlet state with significant cytosine&#8208;to&#8208;formyl charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character. In contrast, ISC in acetonitrile proceeds via a dark 1n&#960;* state with a lifetime of &#8764;3&#8197;ps. CT&#8208;induced ISC is not favored in acetonitrile because reaching the minimum of the gateway CT state is hampered by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which enforces planarity between the aldehyde group and the aromatic group. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the non&#8208;radiative decay of 5fdCyd in solution and new insights into the factors governing ISC in biomolecules. We propose that the intramolecular CT state observed here is a key to the excited&#8208;state dynamics of epigenetic nucleosides with modified exocyclic functional groups, paving the way to study their effects in DNA strands.

         <title>Stable and Storable N(CF3)2 Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10973-10978, July 26, 2021. </description>

Stable storage solutions: Copper(I) and silver(I) complexes with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amido ligand stabilized by pyridine and phosphane ligands have become accessible. These complexes are thermally stable and can be stored under inert conditions; in contrast to the behavior of other metal salts such as M{N(CF3)2} (M=Cu, Ag). The complexes were found to be convenient reagents for nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions, thereby providing access to a series of organic substrates with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.







Abstract
Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agrochemicals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group is an example of a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, examples with the N(CF3)2 group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Herein, a set of CuI and AgI bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with unprecedented stability are presented. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoromethyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.

Functionalized S,N&#8208;heteropentacenes SN5&#8217; comprising annulated thiophene and pyrrole rings with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were developed with systematically varied structural motifs. Tunable frontier orbital energies allowed their application either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells.







Abstract
Ambifunctional heterpentacenes with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were used either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells. Different acceptor moieties and side chains were inserted. Synthesis and characterization of the systematically varied structural motifs provided insight in structure&#8208;property relationships. Moreover, a dimeric heteroacene was synthesized, and the optoelectronic properties were compared to those of its monomeric counterpart.

         <title>Anthrathiadiazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Physical Properties and Two&#8208;photon Absorption</title>

Here, by using a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione, the substituted anthrathiadiazoles with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed. The as&#8208;obtained compounds display the two&#8208;photon absorption, where their cross&#8208;section values are strongly affected by the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups.







Abstract
Anthrathiadiazole is a key synthon for the construction of large azaacenes, however, the attachment of different substituents onto the skeleton of anthrathiadiazole is difficult but highly desirable because it could be easy to enrich the structures of azaacenes. Here, it is demonstrated that anthrathiadiazole derivatives with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed through a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione. The structures of the as&#8208;prepared compounds with different substituents were carefully characterized. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the as&#8208;prepared anthrathiadiazole derivatives were fully investigated, where the cyano&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;CN) has the highest stability and the methoxy&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;OCH3) is easy to be oxidized. Moreover, the two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) characteristics of different anthrathiadiazoles are also studied by using the femtosecond Z&#8208;scan technique. The results show that the fused anthrathiadiazole skeletons possess large TPA cross&#8208;section values &#948;2 in the range of 3000&#8211;5000&#8197;GM, where the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups have strong effect on these values.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, by using a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction&lt;/b&gt; between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;-tetrabromo o-xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-dione, the substituted anthrathiadiazoles with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups could be easily constructed. The as-obtained compounds display the two-photon absorption, where their cross-section values are strongly affected by the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthrathiadiazole is a key synthon for the construction of large azaacenes, however, the attachment of different substituents onto the skeleton of anthrathiadiazole is difficult but highly desirable because it could be easy to enrich the structures of azaacenes. Here, it is demonstrated that anthrathiadiazole derivatives with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups could be easily constructed through a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between &lt;i&gt;a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-tetrabromo&lt;i&gt;-o&lt;/i&gt;-xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-dione. The structures of the as-prepared compounds with different substituents were carefully characterized. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the as-prepared anthrathiadiazole derivatives were fully investigated, where the cyano-substituted derivative &lt;b&gt;(BTH&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;CN)&lt;/b&gt; has the highest stability and the methoxy-substituted derivative (&lt;b&gt;BTH&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; is easy to be oxidized. Moreover, the two-photon absorption (TPA) characteristics of different anthrathiadiazoles are also studied by using the femtosecond Z-scan technique. The results show that the fused anthrathiadiazole skeletons possess large TPA cross-section values &#948;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the range of 3000&#8211;5000&#8197;GM, where the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups have strong effect on these values.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Radiochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10957-10965, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were explored as radiochromic materials responsive to X&#8208;ray irradiation, opening a new avenue for their application. The HOFs reported here have the same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors: one is sensitive to both X&#8208;ray and UV light, while the other one is specifically responsive to X&#8208;ray light. These phenomena provide a precious chance to understand the vital factors that account for the detection specificity of radiochromic materials.







Abstract
Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC&#8208;25, PFC&#8208;26), as a new class of &#8220;all&#8208;organic&#8221; radiochromic smart material, opening a gate for HOFs in this field. PFC&#8208;26 is active upon both X&#8208;ray and UV irradiation, while PFC&#8208;25 is only active upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC&#8208;25 and PFC&#8208;26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC&#8208;25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked&#8208;eye sensor for X&#8208;ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5&#8197;Gy), and excellent stability. The work exhibits the promising practical potentials of HOF materials in photochromic technology.

         <title>Novel WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10998-11004, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hierarchical nanospheres were prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route, with great hydrogen evolution reaction activities. The unique plate of WS2 and the complex solid&#8208;phase structure of Fe0.95S1.05 exposes more active sites for the HER reaction, which helps to improve the accessibility and diffusibility of the electrolyte, and hence the WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalysts display favorable catalytic for HER.







Abstract
Fe0.95S1.05 with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS2 nanosheets via a one&#8208;step solvothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS2 and Fe0.95S1.05 alone, and the optimal WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. The addition of Fe0.95S1.05 was proven to be able to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS2, and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W&#8201;:&#8201;Fe=2&#8201;:&#8201;1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS2/Fe0.95S1.05&#8208;2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of &#8764;0.172&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of &#8764;53.47&#8197;mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst for HER.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flowers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10966-10972, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple ex situ wet chemical transformation method of alkali treatment was proposed to prepare Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers with large specific surface areas from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The relationship between concentration of alkali and the structure properties of corresponding Ni(OH)2 was uncovered. As the results, the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 performed remarkably catalytic properties with lower potential, higher current density and excellent durability towards MOR among various samples.







Abstract
Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)2 with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)2 obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25&#8197;M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this ex situ conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.

A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10869-10874, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of asymmetric spirobiacridine&#8208;based delayed fluorescent emitters are developed and investigated. The triphenyltriazine&#8208;based emitter exhibited a unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), high horizontal orientation ratio (&#920;) of over 80&#8201;%, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 30&#8201;%. The substituents on the triazine electron&#8208;acceptor unit drastically affects the photophysical property and device performance.







Abstract
Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;=100&#8201;%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40&#8201;% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80&#8201;% were developed. Furthermore, the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties were studied, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30&#8201;%.

         <title>Easy Access to Versatile Catalytic Systems for C&#8722;H Activation and Reductive Amination Based on Tetrahydrofluorenyl Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10903-10912, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile rhodium catalystfor the formation C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds was synthesized based on easily available 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorene. The catalyst efficiently works for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds via elimination of the tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand as well as for CH activation of aromatic compounds with the retention of this ligand.







Abstract
On the basis of the 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX2]2 (2&#8201;a: X=Br; 2&#8201;b: X=I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C2H4)2 (1&#8201;a) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (1&#8201;b) with I2 is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]2. The reaction of 2&#8201;b with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)I]+ (3). The halide abstraction from 2&#8201;a,b with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesityleneligands [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]+ (4), (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;7,8&#8208;C2B9H11) (5), and [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;mesitylene)]2+ (6). The structures of 1&#8201;b, 2&#8201;b&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I2, 3PF6, 4TlI4, 5, and [(cod)RhI]2 were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds 2&#8201;a,b efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound 2&#8201;b also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8211;99&#8201;%).

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;Phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10875-10882, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communication between ionic dyes: New triangular rhodamine triads were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as isolated trications in the gas phase. Fluorescence spectra reveal efficient energy transfer from one dye (rhodamine 575) to another (rhodamine 640) despite of electrostatic screening by the &#960;&#8208;spacer. No spectral shift due to the internal Coulomb repulsion between the dyes was observed.







Abstract
When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions in vacuo. We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in D3h configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>

         <dc:description>
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of g&#8208;CN are systematically investigated for the first time. It is found that the luminescence properties of g&#8208;CN are determined by its band gap and two kinds of defects (CN&#8208;defect and C&#8208;defect). The results provide a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and are of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN.







Abstract
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both two kinds of defect states substantially affect the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;Derived 1D Carbon Nanofiber Architecture with Simultaneous Decoration of Single Fe&#8722;Nx Sites and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>

Formidable fibers: A gelatin&#8208;derived 1D hybrid electrocatalyst with highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated into Fe,N co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was synthesized. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is reported for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofiber architectures with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8722;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the FeIII&#8208;complex&#8208;assisted electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of a FeIII complex enables the 1D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolytes. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.

         <title>Cover Feature: Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions (Chem. Eur. J. 42/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10778-10778, July 26, 2021. </description>

A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that, for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8208;O. Norrby, K. W&#228;rnmark, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100890).

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8722;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carrier transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.

         <title>Frontispiece: Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;Abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forged in fire. Flaming phosphorus is the hottest element of current Lewis and Br&#248;nsted superbase design. The electron abundancy makes these compounds highly important tools as ligands or as auxiliary bases in chemical catalysis and thus enables a great variety of so far unimagined chemical transformations. This synthetically informed minireview gives insight into the recent development of phosphorus&#8208;containing superbases, with especial focus on the past five years. For more information, see the Minireview by R.&#8197;F. Weitkamp and B. Hoge on page&#8197;10807&#8201;ff.

Ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted triarylmethylium dyes with electron&#8208;poor fluorenylium or thioxanthylium substituents go (di)radical: Judicious choice of the aryl substituents renders the redox potentials for ferrocenyl oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction so similar as to allow 4&#8208;Fc&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C+Ar2 cations to equilibrate with their paramagnetic valence isomers 4&#8208;FcC.+&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C.Ar2. These equilibria were studied by quantitative spin&#8208;counting methods and by M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy. Our studies revealed that the diradicals and one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced complexes 4&#8208;Fc&#8208;C6H4&#8208;CC.Ar2 dimerize to sizable or nearly quantitative extents.

Functional nanomaterials are indispensable to modern technologies and their low&#8208;temperature synthesis is a key&#8208;step to their incorporation in technologically advanced areas. In our pursuit to identify the reagents that are reactive at low temperature, we exploit here the inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand as a strategy to obtain molecular complexes with ultra&#8208;low decomposition temperature and explore their application as facile precursors to highly crystalline metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Mishra et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101471).

Geometric structural and functional design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to construct various COFs with tailor&#8208;made properties. Regular arrangements of donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties in D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides abundant pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on the design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8722;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;Abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10807-10825, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hunt is still on for the most powerful neutral superbase. The steadily growing scope of applications has resulted in a renaissance of highly electron&#8208;rich phosphorus&#8208;containing Lewis and Br&#248;nsted bases. Strongly &#960;&#8208;donating substituents at the center of basicity can be employed to increase the proton affinity and the &#963;&#8208;donation ability. This minireview highlights recently published achievements focusing especially on the past five years.







Abstract
The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capacity for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases have appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have now made them indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Herein, an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes is given. In addition, due to widespread interest, their use in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted.

         <title>How Science Can Contribute to the Remedial Conservation of Cultural Heritage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10798-10806, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our society needs resilience to stand against social and environmental challenges. Cultural heritage assets are crucial as they foster socio&#8208;economical improvements; however, they are threatened by degradation. We summarize here some of the most valuable solutions science has provided to systematically tackle degradation and re&#8208;valorize our cultural patrimony, overcoming the serendipitous approach of past conservation practices.







Abstract
Colloid science is contributing solutions to counteract the degradation of artifacts, favoring their transfer to future generations. Advanced materials such as nanoparticles, coatings, gels and microemulsions have been assessed in conservation, spanning from archeological sites to modern and contemporary art. We give an overview of the fundamental milestones and latest innovations in conservation science, targeting solutions and tools for remedial conservation based on green nanomaterials and hybrid systems. Future perspectives and outstanding challenges in this exciting field are then outlined.

         <title>Construction of Stable Helical Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Conformationally Rigid &#8220;Concave Ligand&#8221;</title>

Concave concept: A helical metal&#8211;organic framework was prepared by using conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligands with binding units pointing toward each other. To avoid intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thus forming extended frameworks. With this new ligand design, a helical MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was prepared, thereby providing a new strategy for ligand design for the construction of porous materials.







Abstract
A helical metal&#8208;organic framework was prepared by using a conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligand with binding units pointing toward each other (concave ligand). To avoid the obvious intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thereby allowing the formation of extended frameworks for the first time. With this new ligand design, a helical&#8208;shaped MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was successfully prepared, thus providing a new strategy for ligand design toward porous material constructions.

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10826-10832, July 26, 2021. </description>

Simple, but efficient: Inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the tBu2S ligand is exploited to obtain molecular precursors that decompose at low&#8208; or even room temperature to afford metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. Easily extendable to other systems, this strategy can be used to obtain metastable or compositionally complex nanomaterials with greater control and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to harsh conditions.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(tBu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(tBu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(tBu2S)] (3) (TFA=trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.&#8201;g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5, Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.

         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10844-10848, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoretentive N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with cyclohexanones as halogen&#8208;free aryl sources was performed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, comprising a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acid products without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products. This method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity for at least 3&#8197;days.







Abstract
The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. A versatile synthetic method was developed to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.&#8201;e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and turnover frequency (5.9&#8197;h&#8722;1) for at least 3&#8197;days.

The production of synthetically valuable ArCF2X and ArCX3 compounds from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is described, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. To optimize for mono&#8208;exchange, a statistical analysis called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late&#8208;stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide.







Abstract
The facile production of ArCF2X and ArCX3 from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is reported, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange for non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. ArCX3 and ArCF2X products of the reaction are synthetically valuable due to their diversification potential. In particular, chloro&#8208; and bromodifluoromethyl arenes (ArCF2Cl, ArCF2Br respectively) provide access to a myriad of difluoromethyl arene derivatives (ArCF2R). To optimize for mono&#8208;halogen exchange, a statistical method called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to electron rich and electron deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide. These methods are highly practical, being run at convenient temperatures and using inexpensive common reagents.

         <title>Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength of Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxides</title>

         <dc:description>
Chlorination of tellurium has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non&#8208;halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.







Abstract
Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the &#955;4Te dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O ChB distances are 2.062&#8197;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8722;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 heterotetramer with alternating &#955;4Te and &#955;2Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.

         <title>Structure and functional differences of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenases. A computational study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine, which has relevance to the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large active site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes of substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol-containing natural products such as cysteine, which has relevance to the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3-mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second-coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large active site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)-superoxo bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second-coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes of substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2-mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Fluorescent pH Microsensors Based on the Ratiometric Dye Pyranine Immobilized on Silica Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a one&#8208;step synthesis, silica microparticles with efficiently immobilized pyranine (HPTS) dye gave extremely sensitive fluorescent ratiometric pH sensors. Immobilizing dye molecules on oppositely charged silica microparticles by using a positively charged silica shell preserves HPTS&#8242;S pH sensitivity, and also enhances the stability of the sensor particles. The effect of microparticle surface charge manipulation on enhancing the pH sensitivity without perturbing the stability and cytocompatibility is explored.







Abstract
Pyranine (HPTS) is a remarkably interesting pH&#8208;sensitive dye that has been used for plenty of applications. Its high quantum yield and extremely sensitive ratiometric fluorescence against pH change makes it a very favorable for pH&#8208;sensing applications and the development of pH nano&#8208;/microsensors. However, its strong negative charge and lack of easily modifiable functional groups makes it difficult to use with charged substrates such as silica. This study reports a methodology for noncovalent HPTS immobilization on silica microparticles that considers the retention of pH sensitivity as well as the long&#8208;term stability of the pH microsensors. The study emphasizes the importance of surface charge for governing the sensitivity of the immobilized HPTS dye molecules on silica microparticles. The importance of the immobilization methodology, which preserves the sensitivity and stability of the microsensors, is also assessed.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Arylation of Cyclometalated Difluorinated 2&#8208;Arylisoquinolinyl Iridium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysis&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;complex was developed to incorporate diversely substituted aryl group on the ligands of neutral cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes. The regioselectivity of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation is not affected by C&#8722;Ir bond, as the reaction occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two&#8208;fluorine atoms. All post&#8208;functionalized Ir(III) exhibit red phosphorescence with moderate to good efficiency.







Abstract
The utility of C&#8722;H bond functionalization of metalated ligands for the elaboration of aryl&#8208;functionalized difluorinated&#8208;1&#8208;arylisoquinolinyl Ir(III) complexes has been explored. Bis[(3,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)isoquinolinyl](2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionato) iridium(III) undergoes Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation with aryl bromides. The reaction regioselectively occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two fluorine atoms of the difluoroaryl unit, and on both cyclometalated ligands. This post&#8208;functionalization gives a straightforward access to modified complexes in only one manipulation and allows to introduce thermally sensitive functional groups, such as trifluoromethyl, nitrile, benzoyl, or ester. The X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the diarylated complexes were investigated. Whatever the nature of the incorporated substituted aryl groups is, all obtained complexes emit red phosphorescence (622&#8211;632&#8197;nm) with similar lifetimes (1.9&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA editing: Site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing was engineered to be under control of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, applying the mechanism of chemically induced dimerization. Tight control and editing yields up to 44&#8201;% where achieved on endogenous targets in human cell culture.







Abstract
Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20&#8201;% and 44&#8201;% in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease&#8208;relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42&#8201;%. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA&#8208;targeting mechanism is desired.

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C^N complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond&#160; p &#8208;activation and to holds promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8211;C and C&#8211;E (E = heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(C  CH2  N)Cl  2  ] (1, C  CH2  N = 2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained&#160;  via  &#160;1D and 2D NMR analyses as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) C  CH2  N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of&#160;1&#160;with C(sp  2  )&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  2  ) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of Boc&#8208;protected benzylamines bearing two tethered alkyne moieties via a domino reaction initiated by a 6&#8208; endo&#8208;dig  cyclization. The reaction was screened intensively and the scope was explored, resulting in nine new Boc&#8208;protected dihydrobenzo[ c  ]phenanthridines with yields of up to 98%; even a &#960;&#8208;extension and two bidirectional approaches were successful. Furthermore, a thermal cleavage of the Boc&#8208;group and subsequent oxidation was possible to obtain substituted benzo[ c  ]phenanthridines in up to quantitative yields. Two bidirectional approaches were successful using the optimized conditions and the resulting &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were tested as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>

Carbanion cartography: This study maps the stability/reactivity space for &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions leading to the prediction of novel species. Free carbanionic intermediates can be described as borata&#8208;alkene species with a C&#8722;B &#960;&#8208;interaction strongly polarized towards the carbon, whereas multi&#8208;boryl species have very polar C&#8722;B bonds. Extensive analysis of &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors identifies three structural patterns that can be related to reactivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions shows remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tuning its reactivity. Here, the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions are described. DFT&#8208;derived parameters were used to capture their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic center, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counterion. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8722;B &#960; interactions polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, it was possible to classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1)&#8197;nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals, 2)&#8197;nucleophilic &#951;2&#8208;(C&#8722;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3)&#8197;&#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the reactivity sought.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapling peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine (Cys) thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;  p  &#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of thioether linkage between tryptophan (Trp) and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#183;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapling peptides possessing the Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#183;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise stress&#8208;induced transformations of metal&#8208;organic polyhedral cluster&#8208;based assemblies: Where conformational and supramolecular features meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The understanding of factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring the N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity of the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergo pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal events. The observed phase transitions nicely illustrate the key role of an interplay between low&#8208;energy conformational perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2  and the cuprate La2CuO4. As a novelty we explore the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2  by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2  . Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2  and AgF2  . Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2  is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+  ions occupy trigonal sites which, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local Exe trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both the geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+  &#8208;F&#8208;  bonds increase their distance by 15% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes may be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, the present results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2  is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.</dc:description>

The inner diameter of the nanotubes strongly depended on the regioisomeric dihydroxy naphthalene. UV&#8211;vis, fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that nanotubes with smaller inner diameters had weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the tilted amphiphiles complexed with the naphthalene molecules within the membrane walls and showed larger Stokes shifts in the excimer fluorescence of the naphthalene moiety.

A fast, user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment approach by ball milling was developed to selectively enrich the surface of fumed silica. A variety of high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state 17O&#8197;NMR experiments (ultra&#8208;high magnetic field (35.2&#8197;T), 17O&#8197;MQMAS, 2D&#8197;17O&#8722;1H&#8197;D&#8208;HMQC, 17O&#8197;DNP), demonstrate that siloxane and different silanol bonds present at the surface, including H&#8208;bonded and isolated silanols, can be labeled and characterized in detail.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment protocols to help to understand the structure and reactivity of materials by using 17O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15&#8197;min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5&#8201;%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision 17O compositions were measured at different milling times by using large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (LG&#8208;SIMS). High&#8208;resolution 17O&#8197;NMR analyses (including at 35.2&#8197;T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si) and silanols (Si&#8722;OH), while DNP analyses, performed by using direct 17O polarization and indirect 17O{1H}&#8197;CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8722;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D 1H&#8722;17O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using 17O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Ti bonds identified.

         <title>Humins with Efficient Electromagnetic Wave Absorption: A By&#8208;Product of Furfural Conversion to Isopropyl Levulinate via a Tandem Catalytic Reaction in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The by&#8208;product (called humins) is accompanied by a one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion reaction of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL), which is carbonized (Humins&#8208;700) and applied to a new experiment of electromagnetic wave absorption, showing superior electromagnetic wave absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm. This provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption.







Abstract
Both one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL) and carbonization of by&#8208;product (humins) for electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, which provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption. In the former, phosphotungstic acid (PW) is employed as a homogeneous catalyst to convert FAL to PL via a tandem reaction in one pot, with the formation of a vast amount of humins. With FAL and various intermediates as substrates, it was found that humins was a polymerization product of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and furfuryl ester (FE) with furan rings. In addition, the in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectra also provided a basis for the proposed reaction route. In the latter, with the humins as raw material, P species and WO3 doped nano&#8208;porous carbon (Humins&#8208;700) platform formed after high&#8208;temperature annealing is used for electromagnetic wave absorption and manifests desirable absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 4.5 GHz (11.2&#8211;5.7 GHz).

         <title>Janus Pyrrolopyrrole Aza&#8208;dipyrrin: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Assemblies and Slow Magnetic Relaxation of the Cobalt(II) Complex in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Look both ways after crossing: A pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin with a Janus duality (Janus&#8208;PPAD) resulting from the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole and azaarylamine. In addition to the self&#8208;complementary assembly, the cobalt complex functions as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in the presence of a static magnetic field.







Abstract
A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (Janus&#8208;PPAD) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in Janus&#8208;PPAD enabled the metal ions to be arranged at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated Janus&#8208;PPAD dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. Owing to the tetrahedral coordination, in the solid state, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative D value of &#8722;27.1&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with an effective relaxation energy barrier Ueff of 38.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism at low temperature was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis Using Heterogenized Iridium Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenized iridium catalysts were synthesized to generate reusable, robust photoredox catalysts. The catalyst architecture, in nanopowder or thin film forms, was studied to see how it affected the catalytic performance on three different metal oxide surfaces. Reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as the model photoredox reaction, and all catalysts showed successful product generation. Al2O3&#8208;based catalysts were found to be the most robust and reusable catalysts in both architectures, with at least &#8764;1000 turnovers and reusable three times.







Abstract
Heterogenized photoredox catalysts provide a path for sustainable chemical synthesis using highly tunable, reusable constructs. Here, heterogenized iridium complexes as photoredox catalysts were assembled via covalent attachment to metal oxide surfaces (ITO, ZrO2, Al2O3) in thin film or nanopowder constructs. The goal was to understand which materials provided the most promising constructs for catalysis. To do this, reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as a test reaction for system optimization. All catalyst constructs produced acetophenone with high conversions and yields with the fastest reactions complete in fifteen minutes using Al2O3 supports. The nanopowder catalysts resulted in faster and more efficient catalysis, while the thin film catalysts were more robust and easily reused. Importantly, the thin film constructs show promise for future photoelectrochemical and electrochemical photoredox setups. Finally, all catalysts were reusable 2&#8211;3 times, performing at least 1000 turnovers (Al2O3), demonstrating that heterogenized catalysts are a sustainable catalyst alternative.

The factors controlling the so&#8208;far poorly understood complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by different aluminyl anions are revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods.







Abstract
The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.

         <title>Structural Transformation of Surface&#8208;Confined Porphyrin Networks by Addition of Co Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transformation of a porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional network from its H&#8208;bonded phase to a porous metal&#8208;coordinated phase after the addition of Co&#8208;atoms on Au(111) under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions was inverstigated. The networks were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy, low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans meso positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl's nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423&#8197;K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable amino acid has provided access to tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues fully operated under visible light. This has led to linear analogues that have shown good photoswitchability and strain selectivity against A. baumannii and S. pyogenes clinical strains by using different analogues. Activated cis compounds turn back to their deactivated trans form upon short exposure times to sunlight, paving the way to self&#8208;deactivating antibacterials with minor evolutionary pressure on the environment.







Abstract
The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues by using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine&#8197;A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.

         <title>Fine Tunable, Redox Active Octapalladium Chains Supported by Linear Tetraphosphines, Leading to Dynamically 1D Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Polymers</title>

Fine tunable Pd8 chains supported by linear tetraphosphine (meso&#8208;dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=none (1), solvent (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]2+ (X&#8722;=(pseudo)halide (4)) were systematically synthesized and exhibited wide range redox behaviors from {Pd4}4+ to {Pd4}0 through {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings and led by treatment with bisisocyanide (BI) in CH3CN to dynamical 1D assembly of {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n.







Abstract
A series of the octapalladium chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L=none (1), solvents: CH3CN (2&#8201;a), dmf (2&#8201;b), dmso (2&#8201;c), RN&#8801;C: R=Xyl (3&#8201;a), Mes (3&#8201;b), Dip (3&#8201;c), tBu (3&#8201;d), Cy (3&#8201;e), CH3(CH2)7 (3&#8201;f), CH3(CH2)11 (3&#8201;g), CH3(CH2)17 (3&#8201;h)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2](BF4)2 (X=Cl (4&#8201;a), N3 (4&#8201;b), CN (4&#8201;c), SCN (4&#8201;d)), were synthesized by using 2&#8201;a as a stable good precursor, and characterized by spectroscopic (IR, 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR, ESI&#8208;MS) measurements and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses (for 1, 2&#8201;a,&#8201;b, 3&#8201;a,&#8201;b,&#8201;e,&#8201;f, 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). On the basis of DFT calculations on the X&#8208;ray determined structure of 2&#8201;b ([2b&#8208;Pd8]4+) and the optimized models [Pd8(meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8Ph8]4+) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;H2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8H8]4+), with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (B3LYP&#8208;D3, B3LYP), the formation energy between the two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions (ca. &#8722;70&#8197;kcal/mol) with four sets of interligand C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions and Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. All the compounds isolated are stable in solution and exhibit characteristic absorption at &#8764;900&#8197;nm, which is assignable to a spin allowed HOMO to LUMO transition, and shows temperature dependent intensity change with variable absorption coefficients presumably due to coupling with some thermal vibrations. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands. In particular, theoretical calculations elucidated that the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is systematically related to the central Pd&#8722;Pd distance (2.7319(6)&#8211;2.7575(6)&#8197;&#197;) by two ways with neutral ligands L (1, 2, 3) and with anionic ligands X (4), which are reflected on the NIR absorption energy of 867&#8211;954&#8197;nm. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC (6 eq) to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2](BF4)2 (13), and the cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a (L=CH3CN), 3, and 13 (R=Xyl, Mes, tBu, Cy) demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+&#8596;{Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. The oxidized complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)3](BF4)4 (16), were characterized by X&#8208;ray analyses, and the two&#8208;electron reduced chain of [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4](BF4)2 (7) was analyzed by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and DFT calculations. Reactions of 2&#8201;a with 1&#8197;equiv. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, 31P{1H} and 1H&#8197;DOSY NMR spectra as well as SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers may exist in acetonitrile as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50&#8197;units of the Pd8 rod averaged within the timescale.

&lt;/b&gt;), with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (B3LYP-D3, B3LYP), the formation energy between the two Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions (ca. &#8722;70&#8197;kcal/mol) with four sets of interligand C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions and Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; chain. All the compounds isolated are stable in solution and exhibit characteristic absorption at &#8764;900&#8197;nm, which is assignable to a spin allowed HOMO to LUMO transition, and shows temperature dependent intensity change with variable absorption coefficients presumably due to coupling with some thermal vibrations. The structures and electronic states of the Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands. In particular, theoretical calculations elucidated that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap is systematically related to the central Pd&#8722;Pd distance (2.7319(6)&#8211;2.7575(6)&#8197;&#197;) by two ways with neutral ligands L (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and with anionic ligands X (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), which are reflected on the NIR absorption energy of 867&#8211;954&#8197;nm. The isocyanide terminated Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complexes (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) further reacted with excess of RNC (6 eq) to afford the Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes, [Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-dpmppm)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(RNC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;), and the cyclic voltammograms of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; (L=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN), &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; (R=Xyl, Mes, &lt;sup&gt;

         <title>Nitric Oxide Photoreleasers with Fluorescent Reporting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tracking your delivery: Molecular constructs are able to combine light&#8208;regulated release of nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescent reporting functionality to track and quantify in real time the amount of NO delivered, even in complex biological environments, are described, highlighting the logical design and their potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology, and its controlled delivery has great prospects in therapeutic applications. The light&#8208;activated uncaging of NO from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in the cell environment. This contribution provides an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>

Avoiding fibrils: The cationic antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III stabilizes droplet condensates formed by &#945;&#8208;synuclein, thereby impeding their transformation to the fibrillar amyloid state.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as &#945;&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimetallic cooperative catalysis represents one of the most efficient method for asymmetric C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming transformations. An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition reaction catalyzed synergistically by the combination of an achiral palladium catalyst and a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium(III) complex has been developed, generating a series of 1,2,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted tetrahydrofurans in high yields and stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centers. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67&#8201;%&#8764;98&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).

A versatile approach towards 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzoperylenes (DDPs) and related 2,9&#8208;dimethyldibenzoperylenes (DBPs) with various C, O, and N substituents in 1,3,8,10&#8208;positions is presented. It comprises reductive aromatization of PTCDI via O&#8208;silylation and O&#8208;trifylation steps. DDP&#8208;tetratriflate is the strategic key to (hetero)aryl, alkynyl, aminyl or O&#8208;phosphanyl DDPs characterized by UV/Vis/PL spectra, XRD and CV methods and (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DDP 3&#8201;a) and corresponding 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DBP 3&#8201;b) has been developed at multigram scale via reduction of one of the industrially most important high&#8208;performance dyes, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), and of the corresponding dihydroxy peropyrenequinone precursor. The focus of this paper is on the reactivity pattern of 3&#8201;a as key intermediate towards highly functionalized 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzopyrelenes (DDPs) obtained via catalytic substitution of four triflate by aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, aminyl, and O&#8208;phosphanyl substituents. The influence of electron&#8208;donating substituents (OSiMe3, OPt&#8208;Bu2, N&#8208;piperidinyl), electron&#8208;withdrawing (OTf, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl), and of electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated (2&#8208;thienyl, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, trimethylsilyl&#8208;ethynyl) substituents on optoelectronic and structural properties of these functionalized DDPs has been investigated via XRD analyses, UV/Vis, PL spectroscopy, and by electroanalytical CV. These results were correlated to results of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Thus, functionalized DPPs with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies and gap became available via a new and reliable synthetic strategy starting from readily available PTCDI.

         <title>Calcination&#8208;Free Synthesis of Well&#8208;Dispersed and Sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm Spinel Ferrite Nanoparticles as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Case Study of CoFe2O4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CFO NPs) with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine (OAm). The well&#8208;dispersed 9.1&#8197;nm CFO NPs prepared by the aminolytic method exhibited excellent reversible capacity and superior cycling stability compared with those prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method, and the performance could be further enhanced when the size of nanoparticles decreased to 3.4&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles obtained by a traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, and so on.

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a consequence of specific interactions between acetylene molecules and alkyne, aromatic and hydroxide residues of metal clusters, two isoreticular nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones are suitable for the selective separation of the challenging acetylene over CO2 gas mixture. Moreover, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment of these materials with ethanolic KOH solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and the incorporation of extra&#8208;framework potassium ions, which are responsible for a further modulation of the interactions with the adsorbate molecules.

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pimaranes is based on two consecutive cyclization reactions of the linear polyene geranylgeranyl diphosphate. In contrast, our synthetic studies on pimaranes involve a tetracyclization reaction of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether. The modified isoprene enabled a transannular endo&#8208;termination step and rapid assembly of the natural product pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;diol.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular endo&#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic nor&#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;Nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;Field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols, show maximal dynamic nuclear polarization enhancement factors at 18.8 T of &gt;100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibit strong enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. Thus, SNAPols show great application potential in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably&gt;14&#8197;T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dimeric Capsules with Appended Spiropyran Units: Towards Controlled Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled uptake and release: We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;spiropyran tetra&#8208;urea calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole derivatives. The acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the switches was coupled to the homo&#8208;dimeric calix[4]arene capsule's disassembly and the release of the cationic guest to the bulk solution. The neutralization of the acidified solution with Et3N completely restored the original encapsulation complex.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365&#8197;nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594;merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.

         <title>Synthesis and Surface Behaviour of NDI Chromophores Mounted on a Tripodal Scaffold: Towards Self&#8208;Decoupled Chromophores for Single&#8208;Molecule Electroluminescence</title>

Three&#8208;legged race: The efficient synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimides (NDIs) mounted on a tripodal platform are reported. Moreover, their surface behaviour after spraying on Au(111) was studied. In a STML setup, such NDI tripods show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields and thus demonstrate their potential for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
This paper reports the efficient synthesis, absorption and emission spectra, and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimide (NDI) tripodal molecules with thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that, in particular, the pyrrolidinyl group with its strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophores and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry showed the redox properties of NDIs to be influenced by core substituents. The strong electron&#8208;donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in rather high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a sub&#8208;monolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores spray deposited on Au(111) show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also revealed a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10&#8722;3. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.

         <title>Effect of a &#8220;Zn Bridge&#8221; on the Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristics of Volatile Random Access Memory Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Committing zinc to memory: A prominent &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221; effect with extending feature could endow porphyrinated polyimide information memory materials with volatility. The electronic excitation processes and memory behavior of porphyrinated co&#8208;polyimides could be flexibly regulated by simply altering the zinc ion content in the porphyrin core. By strengthening the stability of the &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221;, the retention characteristics of porphyrinated polyimides could be precisely and successively tuned.







Abstract
Polyimide memory materials with a donor&#8211;acceptor structure based on a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next&#8208;generation information storage technology due to their outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance and good dimensional and chemical stability. Precisely controlling memory performance by limited chemical decoration is one of core challenges in this field. Most reported work mainly focuses on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for the expected memory behavior of polyimides; this takes a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we report a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8722;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in the central core of the porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8722;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance merely by altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides.

Synthesis of chiral propargylamines, chiral 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphtho[2,1&#8208;b]furans and naphtho[2,1&#8208;b]furans is realized by using C&#8208;alkynyl N,N&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;(tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl)&#8208;aminals and &#946;&#8208;naphthols as substrates. 1,2&#8208;Addition of &#946;&#8208;naphthols to the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed in&#8197;situ generated N&#8208;Boc&#8208;imines provided chiral propargylamines in moderate to high yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>First Synthesis of the Inherently Chiral Trans&#8208;4' Bisadduct of C59N Azafullerene Using Cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as Tether</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C  59  N has been scarcely explored and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral  equatorial  face  bisadduct of C  59  N, we focused on the isolation of the first  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct, via a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct of C  59  N utilizing  cyclo&#8208;  [2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has a  C  1  symmetry as evidenced by  13  C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the  trans&#8208;  4' addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral  trans&#8208;  4' C  59  N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex  1a  endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway, which engages the Mo&#186;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#186;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex  8  with a Mo&#186;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques,  95  Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex  6  endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5'&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72:28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5'&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios &#8804; 62:38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving High Efficiency at High Luminance in Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Triplet&#8208;Triplet Fusion Based on Phenanthroimidazole&#8208;Benzothiadiazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application for any kinds of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8208;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP, PIBzPCN and PIBzTPA based devices showed EQE of 8.27%, 9.15% and 8.64%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  , with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application for any kinds of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole-benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet-triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP, PIBzPCN and PIBzTPA based devices showed EQE of 8.27%, 9.15% and 8.64%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000 cd m  -2  , with little efficiency roll-off.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and&#160; ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic Zn  II  centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate Zn  II  intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the Zn  II&#160;  centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of Zn.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated. The reaction allowed a broad scope synthesis of C2 substituted pyridine derivatives bearing the &#8208;CF  3  group in good yields engaging   &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;   trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8208;aryne polymerization pathway. The initially generated pyridylidene intermediate undergoes a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl followed by an S  N  Ar process resembling the Smiles rearrangement to afford the desired products.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study on Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n = 1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular platinum fluorides PtF  n  ,  n  = 1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, the photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF  6  embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices at cryogenic conditions provide for the first time experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF  3  , PtF  4  and PtF  5  . Photolysis of PtF  6  enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF  4  , while both PtF  5  and PtF  3  were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF  4  . The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help from one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF  4  , for which a spin&#8208;triplet (  3  B  2g  ,  D  2h  ) coexists with an electronic singlet state (  1  A  1g  ,  D  4h  ) in solid neon matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation  TPE  4+  and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6%~14%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli.</dc:description>

The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial structures of the active complex of midkine and synthetic chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides have been solved by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The rigid ligand is enclosed by a flexible receptor, with an intrinsically disordered region. The 3D structure of the ligands remains as a helical, almost lineal structure, independently of the aromatic substituents introduced.







Abstract
Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells.

         <title>Aromatic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of arenes was performed through a metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. This pallado&#8208;catalyzed reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolated aromatic molecules via an auxiliary&#8208;assisted, palladium catalyzed, C&#8722;H bonds functionalization with trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as reagent is described. The mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;products can be preferentially formed. Some mechanistic investigations were realized to better understand the reaction. This methodology was also extended to fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

         <title>Magnesium Deintercalation From the Spinel&#8208;Type MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 (0.4&#8804;y&#8804;2.0) by Acid&#8208;Treatment and Electrochemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanostructured MgxMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 with cubic spinel structures are studied. According to the DFT calculations, the intermediate compositions can be stable, and the voltage could be tailored with the composition. Partial replacement of Mn by Fe could improve the electrochemical cyclability, whereas the Fe would also induce a disorder of the spinel structure, thereby reducing the electrode capacity. The reactions for the acid&#8208;treatment are different for MgMn2O4 and MgFe2O4. The intermediate composition with low iron&#8208;content and acid&#8208;treatment exhibits a good electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries attract lots of attention because of their high safety and low cost compared to lithium batteries, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn2O4 is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4. The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn3+ (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe3+ (non&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.

         <title>PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) Heterostructured Nanobundles as Advanced Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) heterostructured nanobundles have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and subsequent boride doping. The synergistic effect of heterostructured electrocatalysts facilitates electron transfer and hydrogen adsorption ensure the catalysts to possess excellent catalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition, from the point of view of morphology, the PtM/MxBy NBs with 1D nanowire structure possess abundant active sites, high aspect ratios, which would undoubtedly boom the HER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Optimizing the electronic and synergistic effect of hybrid electrocatalysts based on Pt and Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is of tremendous importance towards a superior hydrogen evolution performance under both acidic and alkaline conditions. However, developing an ideal Pt&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst with moderated electronic structure as well as strong synergistic effect is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricated boron (B)&#8208;doped PtNi nanobundles by a two&#8208;step method using NaBH4 as the boron source to obtain PtNi/Ni4B3 heterostructures with well&#8208;defined nanointerfaces between PtNi and Ni4B3, achieving an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Especially, the PtNi/Ni4B3 nanobundles (PtNi/Ni4B3 NBs) can deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 14.6 and 26.5&#8197;mV under alkaline and acidic media, respectively, as well as outstanding electrochemical stability over 40&#8197;h at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach is also universal for the syntheses of PtCo/Co3B and PtFe/Fe49B with outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance.

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons get a move on: A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP&#8208;1) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The migration and leaching of MOP could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 was encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. Incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68.

A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successfully to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has a diameter of about 20&#8197;&#197;, larger than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14&#8197;&#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7&#8197;&#197;), which means that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. The proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% relative humidity), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#8834;DUT&#8208;68, which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protons get a move on&lt;/b&gt;: A Zr-based metal-organic polyhedron (MOP-1) was self-assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT-68, to synthesize MOP-1@DUT-68. The migration and leaching of MOP could be effectively prohibited if MOP-1 was encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities.

         <title>Analyzing anisotropic exchange in a pentanuclear Os2Ni3 complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os  III  2  Ni  II  3  cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence&#8208;type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin&#8208;orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a singlestep procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size.&#160; Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8208;Ni exchange coupling constant is  J  = &#8722;4.2 cm  &#8722;1  and the  D  parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8208;Ni exchange is  D  =  J  k  &#8722;  J  &#8869;  = 18.8 cm  &#8722;1  , so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic  J  (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large&#8208;temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative  g  value of the Os centres. This negative  g  value is a universal feature of a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination with configuration and strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN) is a versatile building block for the synthesis of 5  d  /3  d  magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic domino reduction&#8722;imine formation&#8722;intramolecular cyclization&#8722;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert in the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of expanded helicenes of different sizes and shapes incorporating phenyl&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;substituents at the inner part of their fjord have been synthesized via sequential Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of appropriately designed diynes, and their racemization barriers have been calculated employing electronic structure methods. These show that the overall profile of the inversions (energies, number of transition states and intermediates, and their relative position) is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. Hence, in&#8208;fjord substitution constitutes an additional tool to handle the mechanical properties in helicenes of uncommonly large diameter. The photochemical characterization of the newly prepared helical structures is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Metal Phosphides as Superior Host Materials for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage system with large theoretical specific capacity is urgently needed because of the rapid development of the society. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates of novel battery systems, when resurged at the end of the 21st century. Li&#8208;S batteries have attracted more and more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg  &#8208;1  which almost quintuple larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the most determined factors in Li&#8208;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. As for the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect which caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In the past decades, though the sulfur cathode has made great development, there are also some enormous challenges needing to conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the battery performance of Li&#8208;S batteries by employing multi&#8208;functional metal phosphides as host materials. The nowadays state of development of sulfur electrode of Li&#8208;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latterly influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, the development trend and practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries are also pointed out in the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical fixation of CO  2  as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr based metal organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO  2  fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO  2  showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO  2  analysis. XPS results demonstrate the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO  2  cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80  o  C and 1 atm of CO  2  ). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO  2  cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of crystalline porous materials&#8217; family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various&#160;energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8208;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8211;H bond, this selective C&#8211;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8211;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8211;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the  in situ  installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8211;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Isomerism in the S3 State of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex Resolved by Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and geometric structures of the water oxidizing complex of Photosystem II in the steps of the catalytic cycle that precede dioxygen evolution remain hotly debated. Recent structural and spectroscopic investigations support contradictory redox formulations for the active&#8208;site Mn4CaO x  cofactor in the final metastable S3 state. These range from the widely accepted Mn(IV)4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model, which presumes O&#8211;O bond formation to occur in the ultimate transient intermediate (S4) of the catalytic cycle, to a Mn(III)2Mn(IV)2 peroxo model representative of the contrasting &#8220;early&#8208;onset&#8221; O&#8211;O bond formation hypothesis. Density functional theory energetics of suggested S3 redox isomers are inconclusive because of extreme functional dependence. Here we leverage the power of the domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital approach to coupled cluster theory, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), to present the first correlated wave function theory calculations of relative stabilities for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the S3 state. Our results enable us to evaluate conflicting models for the S3 state of the OEC and to quantify the accuracy of lower&#8208;level theoretical approaches. Our assessment of the relevance of distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms for the mechanism of biological water oxidation strongly disfavors the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8211;O formation advanced by literal interpretations of certain crystallographic models. The present work serves as a case study in the application of modern coupled cluster implementations to redox isomerism problems in oligonuclear transition metal systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Heterometal&#8208;Functionalization and Template Exchange on the Redox Chemistry of Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as material of interest in many applications such as energy storage and conversion due to their redox activity and molecularly defined structure. However, especially for polyoxovanadates a lack of understanding between structural modifications and physicochemical properties remains. The present study leverages a lacunary dodecavanadate to systematically investigate the electronic effect of heterometal functionalization. While structural distortion affects the stability of the cluster, the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Furthermore, we report the first bromide&#8208;templated analogue of this cluster family. While the halide anion is crucial for the formation of the cluster, no major effect on the electrochemical properties is observed. By improving the understanding of structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationship in this work, we hope to enable a more predictable tuning of redox&#8208;properties of polyoxovandates.</dc:description>
