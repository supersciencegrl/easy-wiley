         <title>Lanthanide Mimicking by Magnesium for Oxazolidinone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, magnesium complexes have emerged as a viable alternative to transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated bonds. However, their potential for advanced catalytic reactions has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we have developed a novel magnesium amide compound (3) using a PNP framework that is both bulky and flexible. Our research demonstrates that compound 3 can effectively catalyze the synthesis of biologically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This synthesis involves a tandem reaction of hydroalkoxylation and cyclohydroamination of isocyanate using propargyl alcohol. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive theoretical calculations to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that these types of transformations have not been reported for magnesium and would significantly enhance the catalytic portfolio of the 7th most abundant element.</dc:description>

         <title>A Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic [[EQUATION]] phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds.&#160;This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Molecular Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Binaphthol&#8208;Decorated Optically Innocent Cyclotriphosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design strategy based on the dendritic effect results in a single chiral chromophore that emits simultaneous persistent RTP and circularly polarized luminescence. This study suggests that the optical features of these compounds are dominated by the pendent BINOL entity without the participation of the cyclophosphazene dendritic core.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features of BINOL&#8208;decorated cyclotriphosphazenes (CPs) are reported for the first time. The luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of these compounds in chloroform solutions and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin films with wt 1&#8201;% doping concentrations are found to be 1.0&#215;10&#8722;3, and 2.9&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. However, no CPL signal is observed for the pristine solids. The enantiomers (CP&#8208;(R)/CP&#8208;(S)) show ultraviolet photoluminescence (~350&#8211;360&#8197;nm) in solution and the solid state. These compounds show ~10&#8197;times larger absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) than the simple BINOLs in the solutions state. In the solid state, CP&#8208;(R) shows larger PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(R); in contrast, the S enantiomer shows lower PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(S); this indicates that the isomer&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;state packing of these compounds plays a crucial role in controlling the PL. Thin films with more than 1&#8201;% doping concentration and pristine solids of these compounds do not show persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) due to concentration&#8208;caused quenching. However, thin films with wt 1&#8201;% of these chiral emitters exhibit pRTP characteristics with a ~159&#8208;343&#8197;ms lifetime under vacuum. Theoretical calculations reveal that the cyclophosphazene acts as an optically innocent dendritic core, and the optical features of these compounds are dictated by the pendent BINOL chromophore.

         <title>Combining Molecular Quantum Mechanical Modeling and Machine Learning for Accelerated Reaction Screening and Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining molecular quantum mechanical modeling and machine learning, reaction screening and discovery can be accelerated significantly. In this Concept, we walk through the main steps associated with a typical workflow for high&#8208;throughput reaction screening campaigns, and highlight best practices and potential pitfalls at every stage.







Abstract
Molecular quantum mechanical modeling, accelerated by machine learning, has opened the door to high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns of complex properties, such as the activation energies of chemical reactions and absorption/emission spectra of materials and molecules; in&#8197;silico. Here, we present an overview of the main principles, concepts, and design considerations involved in such hybrid computational quantum chemistry/machine learning screening workflows, with a special emphasis on some recent examples of their successful application. We end with a brief outlook of further advances that will benefit the field.

         <title>Surface Modification of ITO with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors Results in Electron Selective Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modify ITO: Bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 adduct is employed for the modification of ITO electrodes by spin coating method which develops surface dipoles with dipole moments pointing away from the ITO layer. As a result, the work function of the modified ITO electrodes has reduced significantly which provides a potentially high electron selectivity contact in corresponding OPV devices and a high VOC performance in organic solar cells.







Abstract
Surface modification of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes with organic molecules is known to tune their work function which results in higher charge carrier selectivity in corresponding organic electronic devices and hence influences the performance of organic solar cells. In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have also been proven to be capable to modify the work function of metals and semimetals compared to the unfunctionalized surface via the formation of strong covalent bonds. In this report, we have designed and performed the modification of the ITO surface with NHC by using the zwitterionic bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 as the NHC precursor, applied via spin coating. Upon modification, the work function of ITO electrodes was reduced significantly which resulted in electron selective contacts in corresponding organic photovoltaic devices. In addition, various characterization techniques and analytical methods are used to elucidate the nature of the bound species and the corresponding binding mechanism of the material to the ITO surface.

         <title>Manipulation of Hierarchical Chiral Self&#8208;assembly and Anion Recognition by Supramolecular Systems of &#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, Pillar[5]arenes, and Polyoxometalates</title>

&#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, as a modulator, successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates and modulated the ternary co&#8208;assembly to form hierarchically chiral leaves. By substituting highly similar polyoxometalates, the accurate balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range interactions is demonstrated to be the key to the formation of chiral hierarchical microstructures.







Abstract
Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD/&#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8722; (X=Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8211;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) have potential for delivering organotin(IV) compounds in cancer therapy due to their water solubility, stability, non&#8208;toxicity, and photoluminescence. Two nanosystems were developed by grafting organotin fragments and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid onto NGQDs. In vitro tests demonstrated high cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and minimal effects on non&#8208;cancer cells (HEK293T), with successful uptake and release of the metallodrug in cancer cells.







Abstract
The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in&#8197;vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).

         <title>Isocyanides as Catalytic Electron Acceptors in the Visible Light Promoted Oxidative Formation of Benzyl and Acyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic isocyanides are able to harvest visible light and promote the oxidative formation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations provide key data for mechanistic insights. Furthermore, a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds is reported.







Abstract
The recent disclosure of the ability of aromatic isocyanides to harvest visible light and act as single electron acceptors when reacting with tertiary aromatic amines has triggered a renewed interest in their application to the development of green photoredox catalytic methodologies. Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground&#8208;state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground&#8208; and the excited&#8208;state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provide key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide&#8208;based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry is demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.

         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by amino&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;CD) through different sized alkyl linkers (Cn) is presented. The adsorption properties of GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD materials toward perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS, is studied by combined experimental tests and molecular dynamic simulations allowing deep understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and the adsorption performance.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from drinking water. &#946;CD were functionalized with a pending amino group, and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#946;CD units in the range 12&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% was estimated by combined XPS and elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency, with the hexyl linker derivative GO&#8208;C6&#8208;&#946;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamic simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules retention.

Regioselectively controlled C&#8722;H&#8208;activated direct arylation reactions of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrroles (DTP) are presented providing novel regioselectively substituted DTPs with N&#8208;aryl, unprecedented &#946;&#8208;aryl and &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;diaryl, as well &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208;diaryl scaffolds depending on the catalytic system and substitution at the DTP nitrogen.







Abstract
In this study, regioselectively controlled direct arylation of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrroles (DTPs) is reported. By carefully selecting the catalytic system, Pd source, ligand, and additives, we achieved either selective N&#8208;arylation or unprecedented &#946;&#8208;arylation and &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;diarylation of the DTP core through C&#8722;H activation when reacting unsubstituted H&#8208;DTP with 9&#8208;anthracenyl halides. For N&#8208;substituted DTPs, we obtained regioselective carboxylate&#8208;assisted arylation of the &#945;&#8208;position(s). Consequently, depending on the catalytic system and substitution at the DTP nitrogen, we successfully synthesized novel regioselectively substituted DTPs, including N&#8208;aryl, rarely reported &#946;&#8208;aryl, &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;diaryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208;diaryl scaffolds. These compounds can be straightforwardly prepared and further functionalized for applications as organic electronic materials.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted LnDOTA Chelates from Achiral Starting Materials by Deracemization Under Mild Conditions
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;substituted DOTA chelates can be prepared from racemic and achiral starting materials. The mixture of stereoisomeric ligands produced deracemizes, under mild conditions, to a single diastereoisomeric chelate with the introduction of the metal ion.







Abstract
Substituted derivatives of the DOTA framework are of general interest to alter chelate properties and facilitate the conjugation of chelates to other molecular structures. However, the scope of substituents that can be introduced into the &#945;&#8208;position has traditionally been limited by the availability of a suitable enantiopure starting materials to facilitate a stereoselective synthesis. Tetra&#8208;substituted DOTA derivatives with phenyl and benzoate substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position have been prepared. Initial syntheses used enantiopure starting materials but did not afford enantiopure products. This indicates that the integrity of the stereocenters was not preserved during synthesis, despite the homo&#8208;chiral diastereoisomer being the major reaction product. The homochiral diastereoisomer could be produced as the major or sole reaction product when starting from racemic or even achiral materials. Deracemization was found to occur during chelation through the formation of an enolate stabilized by the aryl substituent. This general ability of aryl groups to enable deracemization greatly increases the range of substituents that can be introduced into DOTA&#8208;type ligands with diastereochemical selectivity.

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based chelation&#8208;type ligands were designed and a detailed evaluation of the light&#8208;modulated changes in their properties were carried out. The photo&#8208;induced enhancement of solubility of one of the azopyrazole&#8208;based ligands enabled its utilization in modulation of catalytic activity of CuAAC reaction in water.







Abstract
We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as chelation&#8208;type light&#8208;controllable ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility, especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized towards controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra by Using Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>

Copper(I)&#8208;catalysed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click chemistry is a versatile post&#8208;synthetic tool to functionalize the surface chemistry of alkyne&#8208;functionalized cuboctahedral Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs). This methodology enables quantitative functionalization of MOPs with a wide range of functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids and biomolecules.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. This study describes the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24 available surface alkyne groups was synthesised. Each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of the &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can react with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. The wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry was exploited to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic PtII complex molecules were electrostatically loaded onto cationic nanosheets of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Although the PtII complexes were loaded discretely onto the nanoparticles in the dry state, when water vapor was adsorbed, the PtII complexes assembled on the nanoparticles owing to the increased mobility the adsorption of water caused in the interstitial space of the LDH aggregates.







Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;assembly of PtII complexes is key to the development of optical and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, but designing and precisely controlling them is still difficult owing to weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we report the successful water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced assembly of an anionic PtII complex [Pt(CN)2(ppy)]&#8722; (Hppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded onto cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions. When the PtII complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the PtII complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the PtII complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. The presence of water vapor led to a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange.

Herein, we report the successful water-vapor-induced assembly of an anionic Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex [Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ppy)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (Hppy=2-phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded onto cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. When the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. The presence of water vapor led to a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was developed with group&#8197;13 elements, B, Al, and Ga. The ligand enabled the stabilization of geometrically strained boron cationic species.







Abstract
A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group&#8197;13 elements, B, Al, and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8722;B&#8722;C angle of 140&#176;. Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polycyclic 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) Reactions from Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A new practical catalyst&#8208;free method for one&#8208;pot synthesis of polycyclic 4,5&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from alkenes was developed. 4,5&#8208;Pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields in the presence of water by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes, and s&#8208;tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions. This method also worked successfully in monocyclic alkene cyclopentene and linear alkene styrene.







Abstract
In the classical Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between alkenes and tetrazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazines are formed. 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazines are rapidly converted to the more energetically stable 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines by 1,3&#8208;prototropic isomerization. In this study, instead of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions, and norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent. To show that this new method works not only on strained polycyclic alkenes but also on monocyclic and linear alkenes, the corresponding 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields from the reactions performed with styrene and cyclopentene as well. The chemical structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were determined by NMR and HRMS analyses. In addition, the exact structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were also experimentally proven by converting them to pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones known in the literature.

The dehydropolymerization of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 using bis(imino)pyridine rhodium pre&#8208;catalysis reveals the &#963;&#8208;amine&#8722;borane complexes, nanoparticle formation, and polyaminoboranes with low residual metal content that can be chemically repurposed to N,N,N&#8208;trimethylcyclotriborazane.







Abstract
The sigma amine&#8722;borane complexes [Rh(L1)(&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;H3B&#8901;NRH2)][OTf] (L1=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine, R=Me, Et, nPr) are described, alongside [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf]. Using R=Me as a pre&#8208;catalyst (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 gives [H2BNMeH]n selectively. Added NMeH2, or the direct use of [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf], is required for initiation of catalysis, which is suggested to operate through the formation of a neutral hydride complex, Rh(L1)H. The formation of small (1&#8211;5&#8197;nm) nanoparticles is observed at the end of catalysis, but studies are ambiguous as to whether the catalysis is solely nanoparticle promoted or if there is a molecular homogeneous component. [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf] is shown to operate at 0.025&#8197;mol&#8201;% loadings on a 2&#8197;g scale of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 to give polyaminoborane [H2BNMeH]n [Mn=30,900&#8197;g/mol, &#208;=1.8] that can be purified to a low residual [Rh] (6&#8197;&#956;g/g). Addition of Na[N(SiMe3)2] to [H2BNMeH]n results in selective depolymerization to form the eee&#8208;isomer of N,N,N&#8208;trimethylcyclotriborazane [H2BNMeH]3: the chemical repurposing of a main&#8208;group polymer.

         <title>Mechanochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Bond Formation between Aryl Iodides and Aromatic Sulfur Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and mild carbon&#8208;sulfur coupling was realized by nickel catalysis under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The desired thioether products were generated from aryl iodides and aromatic thiol/disulfides with broad substrate scope. The Ni(i)/Ni(III) catalytic cycle was facilitated by the mechanochemistry process, thus providing an eco&#8208;friendly and time&#8208;saving strategy for the construction of the C&#8722;S bond in practical synthetic chemistry.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A green and mild carbon-sulfur coupling was realized by nickel catalysis under ball-milling conditions. The desired thioether products were generated from aryl iodides and aromatic thiol/disulfides with broad substrate scope. The Ni(i)/Ni(III) catalytic cycle was facilitated by the mechanochemistry process, thus providing an eco-friendly and time-saving strategy for the construction of the C&#8722;S bond in practical synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Dual Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions for the Conformational Control of Urea
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction has been developed as a means of establishing conformational control in sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing ureas. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives adopt a planar structure bearing an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement (X=S, Se). The rigidity of the structure and the acidity were found to increase in the order benzothiophene&lt;benzoselenophene ureas.







Abstract
Dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed as a novel means for the conformational control of urea derivatives. The formation of a chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction at both sides of the urea carbonyl group was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as computational studies including non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) plot index analysis, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis via DFT calculations. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives that bear chalcogen atoms (X=S and Se) adopt a planar structure via the carbonyl oxygen (O) with an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement on the same side of the molecule. The rigidity of the conformational lock was evaluated using the molecular arrangement in the crystal and the rotational barrier of benzochalcogenophene ring, which indicated a stronger conformational lock in benzoselenophene than in benzothiophene urea derivatives. Furthermore, the acidity of the urea derivatives increases according to the Lewis&#8208;acidic properties of the chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, whereby benzoselenophene urea is more acidic than benzothiophene urea. Tweezer&#8208;shaped urea derivatives were prepared, and their stereostructure proved the viability of the conformational control for defining the location of the substituents on the urea framework.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Aided NO2 Discrimination with an Array of Graphene Chemiresistors Covalently Functionalized by Diazonium Chemistry</title>

Nosey, NO2sey! An e&#8208;nose based on graphene chemiresistors, covalently functionalized by exploiting diazonium chemistry, has been developed to detect and discriminate nitrogen dioxide for environmental and medical applications.







Abstract
Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystems, electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalized with one of three different aryl rings: 4&#8208;nitrophenyl, 4&#8208;carboxyphenyl and 4&#8208;bromophenyl. The distinct modified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e&#8208;nose for NO2 discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO2 was demonstrated through exposure to gaseous solutions with NO2 concentrations in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array was tested by carrying out exposure to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis showed that the e&#8208;nose can discriminate NO2 among all the interfering gases in a two&#8208;dimensional principal component analysis space. Finally, the e&#8208;nose was trained to accurately recognize NO2 contributions with a linear discriminant analysis approach, thus providing a metric for discrimination assessment with a prediction accuracy above 95&#8201;%.

         <title>Cryogenic Ion Fluorescence Spectroscopy: FRET in Rhodamine Homodimers and Heterodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase FRET going cold: Photoexcitation of a rhodamine dye (the donor) in a homo&#8208; or heterodimer composed of two dyes separated by a short alkyl spacer leads to resonant energy transfer (RET) from the donor to the acceptor dye that has a lower excited&#8208;state energy. To selective excite one dye in a homodimer of two chemically identical dyes, experiments were done at cryogenic temperatures to resolve individual absorption bands.







Abstract
The internal electronic communication between two or more light&#8208;absorbers is fundamental for energy&#8208;transport processes, a field of large current interest. Here the intrinsic photophysics of homo&#8208; and heterodimers of rhodamine cations were studied where just two methylene units bridge the dyes. Gas&#8208;phase experiments were done on frozen molecular ions at cryogenic temperatures using the newly built LUNA2 mass spectroscopy setup in Aarhus. Both absorption (from fluorescence excitation) and dispersed&#8208;fluorescence spectra were measured. In the gas phase, there is no dielectric screening from solvent molecules, and the effect of charges on transition energies is maximum. Indeed, bands are redshifted compared to those of monomer dyes due to the electric field that each dye senses from the other in a dimer. Importantly, also, as two chemically identical dyes in a homodimer do not experience the same field along the long axis, each dye has separate absorption. At low temperatures, it is therefore possible to selectively excite one dye. Fluorescence is dominantly from the dye with the lowest transition energy no matter which dye is photoexcited. Hence this work unequivocally demonstrates F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer even in homodimers where one dye acts as donor and the other as acceptor.

Abstract
Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8722; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5&#8197;min) and good sorption capacity (388&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solutions of 2,4,5,7&#8208;tetranitrofluorenone oximate (1) are blue (&#955;max&#8776;600&#8197;nm) in aprotic solvents, independently of polarity, while a red color (&#955;max&lt;560&#8197;nm) is obtained in protic solvents. The hypsochromic shift in absorption is in excellent correlation with the H&#8208;bond donating ability (&#945;) of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). [3]Helical, configurationally labile, 1 is further applied in recognition of enantiopure HBDs that induced electronic circular dichroism (ECD) upon complexation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. This study reports on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group&#8197;5 Elements as Electron&#8208;Density Acceptors
</title>

In this work, the term erythronium bond (EyB) is proposed to name an attractive noncovalent interaction between any electrophilic element of group&#8197;5 and electron&#8208;rich atoms (Lewis bases or anions).







Abstract
Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level, atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group&#8197;5 elements and electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These kinds of bonding are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term erythronium bond is proposed to denote these bonds. X&#8208;ray structures of vanadate&#8208;dependent bromoperoxidases show that these interactions are present also in biological systems.

         <title>Advances in RNA Labeling with Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>

Synthetic RNA with novel fluorine labeling patterns is presented. The study completes the set of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases and enables advanced NMR spectroscopic and cellular applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 group without any RNA sequence restrictions.







Abstract
Fluorine labeling of ribonucleic acids (RNA) in conjunction with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful strategy for spectroscopic analysis of RNA structure and dynamics, and RNA&#8208;ligand interactions. This study presents the first syntheses of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 guanosine and uridine phosphoramidites, their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides by solid&#8208;phase synthesis and a comprehensive study of their properties. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modification is associated with preferential C2&#8242;&#8208;endo conformation of the U and G ribose in single&#8208;stranded RNA. When paired to the complementary strand, slight destabilization of the duplex caused by the modification was revealed by UV melting curve analysis. Moreover, the power of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 label for NMR spectroscopy is demonstrated by dissecting RNA pseudoknot folding and its binding to a small molecule. Furthermore, the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modification has potential for applications in therapeutic oligonucleotides. To this end, three 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modified siRNAs were tested in silencing of the BASP1 gene which indicated enhanced performance for one of them. Importantly, together with earlier work, the present study completes the set of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases (A, U, C, G) and hence enables applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 group without any restrictions in placing the modification into the RNA target sequence.

Combinations of diethyl ether&#8208; and carbene&#8208;coordinated diarylberyllium and beryllium dibromide complexes were shown to undergo reversible and irreversible Schlenk&#8208;type redistribution reactions depending on the steric demand of the aryl substituents affording the corresponding arylberyllium bromide complexes.Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;Analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects (Jones and Helling)







Abstract
The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides, are systematically studied. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp; Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp=2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp=c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2=C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.

In contrast, Mes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1Mes&lt;/b&gt;, Mes=2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exist in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;3Mes&lt;/b&gt;) and free OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1Ph&lt;/b&gt;) reacts with &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;[3Ph]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; donor by an N-heterocyclic carbene, IPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (IPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=C(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;PrNCMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution- and solid-state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven, Non&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion of Silicon Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small silacycles were obtained by small molecule activation with a bromosilylene. The silacycles were treated with isonitriles to induce ring expansion reactions. The saturated rings showed two subsequent isomerisation reactions.







Abstract
Silacycles are ubiquitous building blocks. Small silacycles can typically be expanded catalytically. A silirane, silirene and phosphasilirene as well as a siletane and a silolene were prepared starting from the base&#8208;free bromosilylene [(dtbpCbz)SiBr] (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). As these heterocycles were derived from a dicoordinated silylene, they are susceptible to reactions with an external base. The three&#8208;membered silacycles readily undergo non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion reactions with isonitriles yielding the related four&#8208;membered silacycles. Surprisingly, the ring&#8208;expanded derivatives of the silirane undergo up to two further isomerisation reactions, first by enamine formation and then by another ring expansion. DFT computations were utilised to gauge the scope of this reactivity pattern. Three&#8208;membered silacycles should essentially universally undergo a ring expansion with isonitriles, while for four&#8208;membered silacycles, only very few instances are predicted to accommodate more challenging kinetic requirements of this ring expansion. Larger silacycles lack the ring strain energy required for this ring expansion reaction and are not expected to be expanded.

The reaction of homoleptic beryllium halide with diphenyl beryllium complexes leads to the clean formation of heteroleptic beryllium Grignard compounds [(L)1&#8208;2BePhX]1&#8208;2 (X=Cl, Br, I; L=C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;donor ligand). The influence of ligands and solvent on these compounds, their formation and exchange equilibria in solution were investigated, together with the factors determining the complex constitution.

Vanadium(V) derivatives, and to a lesser extent analogous compounds of niobium and tantalum, form attractive interactions with electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). This bonding, given also by vanadate units in bromoperoxidase enzymes, is markedly different from the coordination bonds formed by the same elements, and possesses the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term &#8220;erythronium bond&#8221; is proposed to denote this kind bonding to honor Andr&#232;s Manuel del R&#237;o, who discovered vanadium.

Changes in the assembly of PtII complexes on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Under dry conditions, PtII complexes are attached to the LDH nanoparticles like starfish on the rocks, and exhibit a monomer&#8208;derived green emission. Under humid conditions, the mobility of PtII complexes increases due to the adsorption of water, like fish swimming among the rocks, resulting in an assembly&#8208;derived orange emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yoshida, M. Kato and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301993). Cover art by Hibiki Asahori.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes in the assembly of Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes&lt;/b&gt; on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Under dry conditions, Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are attached to the LDH nanoparticles like starfish on the rocks, and exhibit a monomer-derived green emission. Under humid conditions, the mobility of Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes increases due to the adsorption of water, like fish swimming among the rocks, resulting in an assembly-derived orange emission.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dyotropic Rearrangement of Diarylethenes: Scope, Mechanism, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 60, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual light&#8208;induced rearrangement of diarylethenes to products with complex tricyclic DihydroDithiaAcenaphthylene (DDA) core has been discovered by accident in 1999. Based on the data accumulated by 2022, it can be considered as a promising photoreaction that provides access to photo&#8208; and thermally stable colored species (dyes) with interesting properties and a range of applications.







Abstract
Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of NiI from NiII with H2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiI complex directly from H2: This paper demonstrates for the first time that a NiI complex can be synthesized in single step from the reaction of a NiII complex with H2 at room temperature. The NiI complex can catalytically reduce N&#8208;methyl acridinium ions. The acridinium ion reduction, which demonstrates electron transfer from H2, rather than hydride transfer is discussed.







Abstract
Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H2, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H2ase), which reacts with H2 to form various hydrogen active species such as NiIII hydride species, NiII hydride species, and NiI low&#8208;valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H2ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of NiI complex directly from H2 has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single&#8208;step synthesis of a NiI complex, via reaction of a NiII complex with H2, stable for over 3&#8197;months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.

         <title>DNA Chimeras as Electrochemical Biosensors for Host&#8208;Guest Measurements in Blood</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensing in real blood: We developed a new class of sensors by covalently modifying an electrode&#8208;bound DNA with cyclobis&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene (i.&#8201;e., blue box), an electroactive host molecule that binds to small electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules. Our sensors are rapid (&lt;5 min), single&#8208;step, reagentless, and afford continuous and stable measurements (&gt;3 days) of guest molecules at physiologically relevant concentrations directly in undiluted bovine whole&#8208;blood.







Abstract
Few sensing platforms have become ubiquitous to enable rapid and convenient measurements at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. Those, however, are &#8220;one&#8208;off&#8221; technologies, meaning that they can only detect a single target and are hardly adaptable. In response, we plan to develop a sensing platform that can be extended to detect other classes of molecules and that affords rapid, convenient, continuous measurements directly in undiluted complex matrices. For this, we decided to rely on a host molecule that presents reversible interactions toward specific guest molecules to develop a new class of sensors that we coined &#8220;Electrochemical DNA&#8208;host chimeras&#8221;. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for our sensor, we decided to use cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (&#8220;blue box&#8221;) that we attached on an electrode&#8208;bound DNA to allow measurements of electron&#8208;rich guests such as dopamine and aspirin. Doing so allows to promote host&#8208;guest complex that could be quantified using blue box's electrochemistry. Because of this unique sensor architecture, we achieve, to our knowledge, the first reagentless, continuous and rapid (&lt;5 min) host&#8208;guest measurements in undiluted whole blood. We envision that given the library of electroactive host molecules that this will allow the development of a sensing platform for measurements of several classes of molecules in complex matrices at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care.

         <title>Neutral Silylyne Complex of Molybdenum: Synthesis, Properties, and Access to Silaiminoacyl Complexes via [2+3] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized and its properties including cycloaddition reactions with alkynes and organic azides were studied. The first silicon version of iminoacyl complexes, i.&#8201;e., silaiminoacyl complexes were obtained by the [2+3] cycloaddition with organic azides. The novel structural and bonding aspects were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in solution. The replacement of the central metal from W to Mo led to a monomer dominant (~98&#8201;%) solution at room temperature. The monomer&#8208;dimer dynamics was investigated based on thermodynamic parameters. The molybdenum silylyne complex underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with alkynes much faster than the tungsten analog. The reactions with organic azides led to the formation of the first example of silaiminoacyl complexes through [2+3] cycloaddition.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A neutral silylyne complex&lt;/b&gt; of molybdenum was synthesized and its properties including cycloaddition reactions with alkynes and organic azides were studied. The first silicon version of iminoacyl complexes, i.&#8201;e., silaiminoacyl complexes were obtained by the [2+3] cycloaddition with organic azides. The novel structural and bonding aspects were revealed by X-ray crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. The replacement of the central metal from W to Mo led to a monomer dominant (~98&#8201;%) solution at room temperature. The monomer-dimer dynamics was investigated based on thermodynamic parameters. The molybdenum silylyne complex underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with alkynes much faster than the tungsten analog. The reactions with organic azides led to the formation of the first example of silaiminoacyl complexes through [2+3] cycloaddition. The structures and bonding aspects of the products were clarified by multiple measurements and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxy&#8208; and Chloroarylation Pathways in Gold&#8208;Mediated Cyclization of 2&#8208;Aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides</title>

Golden time: 2&#8208;Aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides react after diazotization with gold to give 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. DFT calculations show that the arylAu intermediate evolve via external nucleophilic attack over the alkyne, which is more favorable energetically than an insertion process. One of the Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines crystallized with [Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl]&#8722; displaying short Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C contacts, that are maintained in solution.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot diazotization/gold&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides is described. After diazotization, Me2SAuCl triggers an oxy&#8208; and/or chloroarylation of the alkyne moiety, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show the significant energetic preference of both processes over an insertion pathway. Notably, a Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indoline crystallized with [Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl],&#8722; exhibiting Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C short contacts.

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Cyclic [3]Spirobifluorenylene Compound
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical cation species of cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends was designed and prepared to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The spin delocalization in the whole molecule due to intramolecular electron transfer was revealed by both calculation and experiments.







Abstract
Cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends (1) was designed and synthesized to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The three bifluorenyl units in 1 are conjugated to each other via spiro&#8208;conjugation, resulting in the splitting of the HOMO levels to a small extent. Therefore, the SOMO&#8208;HOMO gap of the radical cation species is small, which is considered to allow the facile intramolecular electron transfer. The electronic properties of 1 and its partial structures were characterized by absorption and fluorescence measurements and electrochemical analysis. From the electrochemical oxidation, the interchain Coulombic repulsion was observed. In the TD&#8208;DFT calculations for the radical cation species of 1, the geometry&#8208;featured interchain electronic transitions were visualized by NTO calculations. The radical cation species of 1 generated by chemical oxidation with SbCl5 exhibited a broadened and lower&#8208;energy NIR absorption band exceeding 2000 nm. Considering the results of the TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the NIR band of the radical cation of 1 was attributed to the intramolecular electron transfer processes among the bifluorenyl units in the macrocycle. ESR experiments also indicated the delocalization of a spin of 1&#8901;+ in the whole molecule via hole hopping in the ESR time scale at room temperature. This work demonstrates the usefulness of spiro&#8208;conjugation as a bridging unit in molecular wires to facilitate smooth electron transfer.

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin modulated by Cl&#8722; has been developed. Na+, competing with H+, is taken up from the cytoplasmic surface, translocates across the retinal, and reaches the site coordinated by Asp116, Ser70, and Asn112. This process is specifically promoted by Cl&#8722; when an extracellular Glu160 is replaced by a glutamine.







Abstract
Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8722; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8722;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100&#8197;mM Cl&#8722; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8722; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8722; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8722; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.

         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective rollover cyclometallation, assisted by conjugated olefin, is unveiled for the annulation of alkynes at two distant C&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkenyl phenols. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8722;H functionalization. The reaction is also totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination.







Abstract
Although challenging, the distant C&#8722;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8722;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8722;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.

         <title>Synthesis and Bioluminescence of &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;Shaped Firefly Luciferin Analogues Based on A Novel Benzobisthiazole Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 4&#8201;new D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon a &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped benzobisthiazole core, with structurally and electronically different amines is described. Their bioluminescence and photophysical characteristics were determined. With a variety of luciferases, the new &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins provided longer wavelengths than D&#8208;luciferin. The combination of luciferase PpyLuc and the pyrrolidine analogue showed the longest bioluminescence wavelength at 636&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The design of &#960;&#8208;extended conjugation &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped red shifted bioluminescent D&#8208;luciferin analogues based on a novel benzobisthiazole core is described. The divergent synthetic route allowed access to a range of amine donor substituents through an SNAr reaction. In spectroscopic studies, the &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;shaped luciferins exhibited narrower optical band gaps, more red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra than D&#8208;luciferin. Their bioluminescence characteristics were recorded against four different luciferases (PpyLuc, FlucRed, CBR2 and PLR3). With native luciferase PpyLuc, the &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;shaped luciferins demonstrated more red&#8208;shifted emissions than D&#8208;luciferin (&#955;bl=561&#8197;nm) by 60 to 80&#8197;nm. In addition, the benzobisthiazole luciferins showed a wide range of bioluminescence spectra from the visible light region (&#955;bl=500&#8197;nm) to the nIR window (&gt;650&#8197;nm). The computational results validate the design concept which can be used as a guide for further novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon other &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;shaped heterocyclic cores.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Formate Catalyzed by a Neutral, Coordinatively Saturated Tris&#8208;Carbonyl Mn(I)&#8208;PNP Pincer&#8208;Type Complex</title>

To MLC or not to MLC? CO2 hydrogenation to formate was achieved under mild conditions of pressure and temperature in the presence of a neutral Mn(I) pincer&#8208;type tris(carbonyl) catalyst that does not require metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC).







Abstract
CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to formate was achieved (TONmax=ca.&#8197;3800) in the presence of the neutral, halide&#8208;free, coordinatively saturated tris(carbonyl) manganese pincer&#8208;type complex [Mn(PNP)(CO)3], bearing a diarylamido pincer&#8208;type PNP ligand, using DBU as base and LiOTf as Lewis acid additive, under mild reaction conditions (60&#8197;bar, 80&#8201;&#176;C). DFT calculations suggest that the precatalyst activation key step occurs by intermolecular, base assisted dihydrogen heterolytic splitting rather than by the expected ligand&#8208;assisted intramolecular MLC&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations with Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of four mixed or &#8220;hybrid&#8221; pyridinium amidate/amidate donors into a macrocyclic ligand leads to a superior iron catalyst that resists acid&#8208;induced demetallation and rapidly catalyses hydrogen peroxide oxidation of the surrogate organic pollutant orange II in water at pH&#8197;7 and at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The macrocyclic proligand [H4L][OTf]2, which contains four carboxamide functions and two conjugated pyridinium groups, is easily deprotonated by the weak base sodium acetate to give the corresponding neutral proligand [H2L]. Metallation of [H2L] with iron(II) chloride proceeds rapidly to form the macrocyclic complex, [FeIIICl(L)]. This is an effective catalyst for the oxidation of the organic dye orange II by hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution, and the kinetic parameters for this reaction have been determined. In striking contrast to an analogous iron&#8208;TAML complex that contains two phenyl groups in place of the two pyridinium groups, [FeIIICl(L)] is a very active oxidation catalyst at pH&#8197;7 and is also highly stable towards acid&#8208;promoted demetallation at pH&#8197;5 or above. The results show that the two pyridinium groups bring greatly enhanced catalytic properties to [FeIIICl(L)].

         <title>Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of&#160;&#160; platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;&#8208;diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH3)2Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3&#160; (L1 = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, DACH = 1R,2R&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) containing an electron deficient L1&#8208;H O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH3)2Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 (L2 = 1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione) containing an electron&#8208;rich L2&#8208;H O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing CF3 group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in vitro and in vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of complexes</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced hydroxyl adsorption in ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for efficient alkaline methanol oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge trcellansfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.</dc:description>

         <title>Field&#8208;assisted Regulation Induced by Cobalt&#8208;Doped ZnO for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal&#160;candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices.&#160;However, the&#160;growth of lithium dendrite&#160;and significant&#160;volume expansion pose as&#160;obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries.&#160;Herein, we design a functional&#160;copper&#160;current collector&#160;by coating it with&#160;Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance&#160;the lithiophilicity&#160;through local electric fields and&#160;built&#8208;in magnetic fields&#160;induced&#160;by the ferromagnetic material.&#160;The incorporation&#160;of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerates electron transfer, but also imparts&#160;the ferromagnetic behavior to&#160;ZnO,&#160;resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting&#160;from&#160;the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1 mAh cm&#8208;2, maintaining ultra&#8208;low voltage for over 2000 h. This study&#160;provides a realizable pathway for next&#8208;generation&#160;current collector of copper&#160;modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a]pyridine Carboxamide and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for regiodivergent C&#8722;H olefination of Imidazo [1,2a] pyridine carboxamide and unactivated alkenes has been developed. This protocol works for a diverse range of Imidazo [1,2a] pyridine carboxamide derivatives and various aliphatic alkenes and styrenes. The success of this chemistry is supported by experimental and computational mechanistic studies, making it a promising solution for a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge in organic chemistry.







Abstract
Despite remarkable successes in linear and branched vinyl (hetero) arene synthesis, regiodivergent C&#8722;H olefination with a single catalytic system has remained underdeveloped. Overcoming this limitation, a Pd/MPAA&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent C&#8722;H olefination of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides with unactivated terminal alkenes to generate branched and linear olefinated products depending upon the electronic nature of alkenes is reported herein. Moreover, this protocol can be applied for C&#8722;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O as deuterium source. Preliminary experimental studies combined with computational investigations (DFT studies) suggest that regiodivergent olefination can be controlled by olefin insertion and &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination steps.

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8722;C Bonds with Boronic Acids
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling between iodo&#8208;dodecaborate and organic boronic acids succeeds. DavePhos is optimal as ligand. For electron&#8208;rich aromatics and aliphatics, CD3CN is best solvent, and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor aromatics.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic molecules have recently received great interest due to their unique properties, which give access to their implementation in biological and material sciences. Herein, a new synthetic approach for the direct&#8208;linkage of the purely inorganic dodecaborate cluster to organic building blocks through B&#8722;C bond is established, using boronic acids as functional groups on the organic moiety, reacting under Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling conditions with iodo&#8208;undecahydridododecaborate. The choices of ligand (DavePhos) and solvent (N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor, CD3CN for electron&#8208;rich groups) are essential for the successful coupling. Ultimately, the newly described methodology is found to be functional&#8208;group tolerant covering a wide spectrum of substrates including electron&#8208;poor arenes.

         <title>Deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 (IRMOF&#8208;10) is reported using a bromide&#8208;mediated deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9 via dissolution of the second interpenetrating network. A combination of gas sorption, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and dye exclusion tests corroborate the synthesis of a deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 product.







Abstract
One of the iconic characteristics of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is the possesssion of guest&#8208;accessible pores. Increasing pore size has a direct and often beneficial impact on a MOF's adsorption and separation properties. However, as pore size increases, the resulting void spaces are often filled by interpenetrated frameworks, where one or more networks crystallize within the pore system of another identical network, reducing the MOF's free volume and pore size. Furthermore, due to the thermodynamic favorability of interpenetration during solvothermal synthesis, techniques to synthetically differentiate interpenetrated from non&#8208;interpenetrated MOFs are paramount. This study reports the synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 via halide mediated deinterpenetrative conversion of Zn4O&#8208;derived IRMOF&#8208;9. IRMOF&#8208;9, when treated with ethylammonium bromide, is quasi&#8208;selectively etched, revealing the non&#8208;interpenetrated analogue, IRMOF&#8208;10 (deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9), which can be isolated prior to complete dissolution by the bromide solution. Dye adsorption, surface area and pore size distribution analysis, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction are consistent with successful deinterpenetration.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Complexes Bridged by an Unsymmetrical Bis(NHC) Ligand: Study of Enhanced Catalytic Activity in Tandem Transformations and Understanding of Cooperativity between the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bis(NHC) ligand L1 supported heterobimetallic complexes IrIII&#8208;M (M=PdII/AuI, 5&#8211;6) and PdII&#8208;IrIII (7) were synthesized via selective sequential metalation. Evaluation of their activities in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions revealed that the heterobimetallic catalysts 5 and 7 exhibit clear advantages over the equivalent catalytic systems comprising either the homobimetallic IrIII and PdII catalysts, 8 and 9, or the monometallic analogs PdII (10) and IrIII (11). Interestingly, the heterobimetallic complex 5 displays superior activity compared to 7, which could be correlated to a better communication/cooperativity between the orthometalated IrIII and PdII centers in 5 as validated by NMR, electrochemical, and theoretical studies.







Abstract
The bis(azolium) salt [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 was found to serve as a suitable platform for accessing the heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;M (M=PdII/AuI) and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes. Initially, selective mono&#8208;metalation of [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 yielded an orthometalated IrIII&#8208; or non&#8208;orthometalated PdII&#8208;complex. Sequential metalation of the mono&#8208;IrIII complex resulted in the formation of heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII/AuI complexes. Similarly, a distinct heterobimetallic PdII&#8208;IrIII complex was synthesized starting from the mono&#8208;PdII complex. Further, the corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII and PdII&#8208;PdII complexes were directly obtained from [L1&#8208;H2]Br2. Additionally, monometallic PdII and IrIII analogues were synthesized from [L2&#8208;H]Br and [L3&#8208;H]Br, respectively. The heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes were then evaluated as catalysts in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions in which they demonstrated superior activity than the mixtures of both their corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII/PdII&#8208;PdII and monometallic IrIII/PdII counterparts, under the constant concentrations of metal centers. Moreover, while comparing complexes IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII, the former exhibits higher activity in all the studied reactions. All these findings suggest the presence of some form of cooperativity between the two metal centers (Ir and Pd) connected by a single ligand framework in IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complex, with IrIII&#8208;PdII displaying better cooperativity that has been validated by electrochemical, NMR, and DFT studies.

&lt;p&gt;The bis(azolium) salt [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found to serve as a suitable platform for accessing the heterobimetallic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-M (M=Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;) and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. Initially, selective mono-metalation of [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yielded an orthometalated Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;- or non-orthometalated Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-complex. Sequential metalation of the mono-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex resulted in the formation of heterobimetallic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. Similarly, a distinct heterobimetallic Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex was synthesized starting from the mono-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex. Further, the corresponding homobimetallic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were directly obtained from [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, monometallic Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; analogues were synthesized from [&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;-H]Br and [&lt;b&gt;L3&lt;/b&gt;-H]Br, respectively. The heterobimetallic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were then evaluated as catalysts in various one-pot tandem catalytic reactions in which they demonstrated superior activity than the mixtures of both their corresponding homobimetallic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and monometallic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts, under the constant concentrations of metal centers. Moreover, while comparing complexes Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;, the former exhibits higher activity in all the studied reactions. All these findings suggest the presence of some form of cooperativity between the two metal centers (Ir and Pd) connected by a single ligand framework in Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex, with Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; displaying better cooperativity that has been validated by electrochemical, NMR, and DFT studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light Driven Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of Activated Alkenes for &#946;&#8208;Ketophosphine Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light driven iron&#8208;catalyzed oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of activated alkenes with secondary phosphine oxides under air at room temperature led to &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides in 43&#8211;97&#8201;% isolated yields. The proposed mechanism involved a blue light promoted aerobic process catalyzed by iron which generated a phosphorus radical from the starting secondary phosphine oxide.







Abstract
We have developed an original blue&#8208;light mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of activated alkenes by secondary phosphine oxides under air at room temperature. Various &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides were then obtained in 43&#8211;97&#8201;% isolated yields. Control experiments revealed that radical process is involved in the mechanism.

         <title>Biochar&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Porous Carbon as Tellurium Host for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Tellurium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Te@PC&#8208;MS composites based on the biomass carbon from mangosteen shell exhibit the superior K+&#8208;storing performances. The existence of abundance of micro&#8208;/mesopores in the hierarchical structure could effectively alleviates volume fluctuance during K&#8208;Te battery operation.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion battery is promising for its high abundance and low redox potential. As a conversion cathode, Te possesses high conductivity and theoretical volumetric capacity to couple with potassium. The stubborn issues of K&#8208;Te battery focus on the large volume change and rapid structure degradation of Te. Herein, we produce biomass carbon from mangosteen shell in a facile method, and obtain a hierarchical porous host with abundance of micropores and mesopores, which is obviously beneficial for hosting Te during K+ storage in K&#8208;Te battery. The specific capacity reach to 560&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the initial cycle at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and remained 83.8&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. Impressively, at a high current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacity still remained 62.6&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycle. These results endow such strategy an efficient way for the development of K&#8208;Te batteries.

         <title>Linear bis&#8208;Coordinate Silver(I) and Iodine(I) Complexes with R3R2R1N Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic prochiral NR1R2R3 amines become chiral with opposite absolute configurations of the sp3 nitrogen atom &#8216;&#8217;locked&#8217;&#8217; in meso&#8208;[R3R2R1N&#8722;I&#8722;NR1R2R3]+, halogen(I) complexes, which are described as such based on the X&#8208;ray crystallography data of their parent meso&#8208;[R3R2R1N&#8722;Ag&#8722;NR1R2R3]+ complexes.







Abstract
Homoleptic [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]+ iodine(I) complexes (where L is a R3R2R1N tertiary amine) were synthesized via the [L&#8722;Ag&#8722;L]+&#8594; [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]+ cation exchange reaction. In solution, the amines form [R3R2R1N&#8722;Ag&#8722;NR1R2R3]+ silver(I) complexes, which crystallize out from solution as the meso&#8208;[L&#8722;Ag&#8722;L]+complexes, as characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The subsequent [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]+ iodine(I) analogues were extremely reactive and could not be isolated in the solid state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the Ag+&#8722;N and I+&#8722;N interaction energies in silver(I) and iodine(I) complexes, with the former ranging from &#8722;80 to &#8722;100&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and latter from &#8722;260 to &#8722;279&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures revealed Ag+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C&#960; and Ag+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C short contacts between the silver(I) cation and flexible N&#8208;alkyl/N&#8208;aryl groups, which are the first of their kind in such precursor complexes.

         <title>Palladium Complexes of N&#8208;Methylcorroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corroles at a looking glass: The inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation of a corrole can afford two monoalkylated regioisomers that are intrinsically chiral. The enantiomeric pairs have been separated by chromatography, and their absolute configuration assigned. The N&#8208;alkylation strongly influences the coordination chemistry of the corrole, making possible the preparation of divalent ion complexes, such as PdII. The photophysical properties of N&#8208;alkylcorroles are promising for future applications both as photosensitizers and catalysts. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Paolesse and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302517).

         <title>Mechanism of CO2 Reduction to Methanol with H2 on an Iron(II)&#8208;scorpionate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mechanism of a homogeneous catalyst that binds H2 and CO2 on an iron(II)&#8208;scorpionate complex has been investigated. Calculations show that the iron complex can heterolytically cleave H2 into a hydride and proton that bind on different sites of the complex. CO2 is then reduced through successive hydride and proton transfer steps to ultimately form methanol products. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302832).

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly and Triply Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel quinone compounds derived from doubly and triply linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes have been synthesized and characterized. Doubly linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties with significant red&#8208;shifts to 1300&#8197;nm upon metalation. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;i. Yamashita, D. Hirano, and K.&#8208;i. Sugiura (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302637).

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Brominated BODIPY Crystals: a Crystallographic and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds (XB) in BODIPYs, were analyzed with the increasing number of bromine atoms. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds were found, and a rhombic&#8208;like structure was formed by XB interactions. Computational analyses and fingerprint plots showed that there is an increase in Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts contributions that depend on the number of bromine atoms.







Abstract
The study of halogen bonds (XBs) has been a subject of great interest in recent years due to its clear application in catalysis, liquid crystals, and crystal engineering. In this study, we analyzed the intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds in BODIPYs with an increasing number of bromine atoms. The computational study included analyses through three different methods: the first approach of close contacts provided by mercury, then the expanded approach of the electron density partition of the molecules in the crystals provided by the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces, and finally, the approach of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QT&#8208;AIM) to characterize the non&#8208;covalent interactions through finding electron density critical points between atoms and between neighboring molecules. The use of different computational methods allowed to gain insight into the interactions directing the crystal packing as the number of bromine atoms increased in the BODIPY moiety. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds involving halide/halide were found. The penta&#8208;brominated BODIPY showed four&#8208;center cyclic nodes where each node is linked via XBs. This kind of motif can be useful in supramolecular chemistry and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964; = 0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). Some hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Activates Coumarin&#8208;Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m7G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non&#8208;translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analogue and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450 nm. In cells, irradiation triggers translation of mRNAs with the N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap via cytoplasmic cap methylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Relaxations of Chromium Nitride Porphyrinato Complexes Driven by the Anisotropic g&#8208;factor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials are useful candidates as the spin qubit due to their long coherence time and high designability. The anisotropy of the g&#8208;values of the metal complexes can be utilized to access the individual spin of the metal complexes, making it possible to achieve the scalable molecular spin qubit. For this goal, it is important to evaluate the effect of g&#8208;value anisotropy on the magnetic relaxation behaviour. We report here the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour of chromium nitride (CrN2+) porphyrinato complex (1), which is structurally and magnetically similar with the vanadyl (VO2+) poprphyrinato complex (2) which is known as the excellent spin qubit. Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of 1 and 2 revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does. Our results provide a design criterion for construction of multiple spin qubit based on g&#8208;tensor engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625 V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160 mW cm&#8208;2 and a large specific capacity of 802 mA h g&#8208;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Co&#8208;Catalyzed Isocyanide Insertion with Sulfonyl Azide: Synthesis of Sulfonyl Carbamimidic Azide and Sulfonyl Aminotetrazole via Carbodiimide Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an operationally simple and efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. Initially, the carbamimidic azide is formed, which cyclizes only in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole in very good yields. The sulfonyl aminotetrazole can also be synthesized directly without isolating the carbamimidic azide in the presence of base. The sulfonyl azide is anticipated to generate nitrene and reacts with isocyanide to produce carbodiimide. Subsequent addition of azide (TMS&#8208;N3) to carbodiimide results in the formation of carbamimidic azide.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Hydrogen Storage Capacity in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we show how Bayesian Optimisation (BO) may be used to find the MOF with the highest simulated hydrogen storage capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BO searches more effectively than evolutionary and one&#8208;shot supervised machine learning approaches.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be employed for gas storage, capture, and sensing. Finding the MOF with the best adsorption property from a large database is usual for adsorption calculations. In high&#8208;throughput computational research, the expense of computing thermodynamic quantities limits the finding of MOFs for separations and storage. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for estimating the H2 uptake capability of MOFs by using an existing dataset containing 98000 real and hypothetical MOFs. We demonstrate that in order to recover the best candidate MOFs, less than 0.027&#8201;% of the database needs to be screened using the BO method. This allows future adsorption experiments on a small sample of MOFs to be undertaken with minimal experimental effort by effectively screening MOF databases. In addition, the presented BO can provide comprehensible material design insights, and the framework will be transferable to optimizing other target properties. We also suggest using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a swarm intelligence technique in artificial intelligence, to estimate MOFs&#8217; H2 uptake potential to achieve results comparable to BO. In addition, we implement a novel modification of PSO called Evolutionary&#8208;PSO (EPSO) to compare and find interesting outcomes.

Keying Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization of bromofuran with N&#8208;tosylhydrazone, followed by a tandem reaction, concise synthesis of C11&#8208;oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine B was accomplished.







Abstract
Total syntheses of C11&#8208;oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine B, were achieved. The key for the synthesis is a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization of bromofurans with N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, followed by acid&#8208;mediated tandem transformation to construct the tetracyclic skeleton with the C11&#8208;oxygen functional group. Chemo&#8208;selective and catalytic functional group conversions of the tetracyclic intermediate completed the synthesis of fortuneicyclidins and cephalotine B in 8 and 9 steps, respectively.

         <title>PI and PIII Ions Supported by BZIMPY Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dicationic Lewis acids is reported, featuring PIII&#8722;X fragments supported by substituted 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands that are readily converted to the corresponding PI salts, which can be oxidized to regenerate the PIII&#8722;X dications. The PIII&#8722;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X+, PX, and P+ transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The related PI cations are shown to be very effective P+ transfer agents when treated similarly.







Abstract
We report a class of compounds in which both PIII&#8722;X and PI forms featuring the same ligand are stable and readily cycled with each other. A series of PIII&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) dicationic triflate salts supported by benzyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;substituted 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands is synthesized. Surprisingly, treatment of these with R3PO (R=Et, Oct) results in reduction to BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI monocationic triflate salts while treatment with Ph3P reduces but also substitutes the compound to produce Ph3P&#8208;BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI dicationic triflate salts. The mechanisms of these surprising reductions are probed experimentally and rationalized computationally. The PIII&#8722;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X+, PX, and P+ transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The PI mono&#8208; and dications are shown to be very effective P+ transfer agents when treated similarly. Oxidation from a monocationic PI salt back to the dicationic PIII&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br) salt was achieved by treatment with N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). Full characterization is reported using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry where suitable crystals were isolated.

A series of P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) dicationic triflate salts supported by benzyl- and allyl-substituted 2,6-bis(benzimidazole-2-yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands is synthesized. Surprisingly, treatment of these with R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO (R=Et, Oct) results in reduction to BZIMPY-ligated P&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; monocationic triflate salts while treatment with Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P reduces but also substitutes the compound to produce Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P-BZIMPY-ligated P&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; dicationic triflate salts. The mechanisms of these surprising reductions are probed experimentally and rationalized computationally. The P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, PX, and P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The P&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; mono- and dications are shown to be very effective P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer agents when treated similarly. Oxidation from a monocationic P&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; salt back to the dicationic P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br) salt was achieved by treatment with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Full characterization is reported using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffractometry where suitable crystals were isolated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control and Transferability of Magnetic Interactions in Supramolecular Structures: Trimers of {Cr7Ni} Antiferromagnetic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical coupling of antiferromagnetic rings into hetero&#8208;spin supramolecular structures is reported by different routes: control of molecule&#8230;molecule magnetic interactions is demonstrated with transferability of parameters from simpler building blocks.







Abstract
A synthetic strategy is demonstrated to prepare two distinct trimers of antiferromagnetically coupled {Cr7Ni} rings, substantially varying the magnetic interactions between the spin centres. The interactions were studied using multi&#8208;frequency cw EPR: in a trimer linked via non&#8208;covalent H&#8208;bonding interactions no measurable interaction between rings was seen, while in a trimer linked via iso&#8208;nicotinate groups isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of +0.42 and &#8722;0.8&#8197;GHz, respectively, were observed. The latter are the same as those for a simpler hetero&#8208;dimer system, showing how the spin&#8208;spin interactions can be built in a predictable and modular manner in these systems.

These cycloaddition reactions constitute the first example of a dipolarophile with a single strong activating group (i.&#8201;e. 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes) reacting with 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone derived Pd&#8208;stabilized zwitterionic dipoles.







Abstract
A formal palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative (4+2) cycloaddition reaction between 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes has been developed to produce highly valuable, densely functionalized tetrahydroquinolines in moderate to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The optimised protocol tolerates a range of substituted 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes, which represent an under&#8208;utilized class of dipolarophile for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cycloadditions. The employed reaction methodology facilitates efficient cycloaddition with both N&#8208;H&#8208; and N&#8208;Ts&#8208;4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone dipole precursors. The stereochemistry of the major and minor diastereomeric (4+2) cycloadducts was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. A mechanistic rationale for the high intrinsic diastereoselectivity and preliminary enantioselective experiments are also presented. The tetrahydroquinoline cycloadduct products feature numerous pendant functionalities, including a vinyl handle, an internal alkyne motif and a nitro functionality (which functions as a latent C&#8208;3 nitrogen substituent) for further synthetic manipulations.

         <title>Control of Substrate Conformation by Hydrogen Bonding in a Retaining &#946;&#8208;Endoglycosidase</title>

A hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation in a glycosidase: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in enzyme mutants) knocks it out.







Abstract
Bacterial &#946;&#8208;glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;&#8208;cellulose, &#946;&#8208;glucans and &#946;&#8208;xylans from different sources, offering diverse biomedical and industrial uses. It has been shown that a conformational change of the substrate, from a relaxed 4C1 conformation to a distorted 1S3/1,4B conformation of the reactive sugar, is necessary for catalysis. However, the molecular determinants that stabilize the substrate's distortion are poorly understood. Here we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)&#8208;based molecular dynamics methods to assess the impact of the interaction between the reactive sugar, i.&#8201;e. the one at subsite &#8722;1, and the catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) on substrate conformation. We show that the hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in an enzyme mutant) knocks it out. We also show that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro derivatives, widely used to trap the reaction intermediates by X&#8208;ray crystallography, reproduce the conformation of the hydrolysable substrate at the experimental conditions. These results highlight the importance of the 2&#8208;OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile interaction in substrate recognition and catalysis in endo&#8208;glycosidases and can inform mutational campaigns aimed to search for more efficient enzymes.

         <title>Novel Aspects about &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; in Upconversion Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept briefly reviews recent advances in temporal response (TR) and lifetime of upconversion luminescence, including lifetime control methods, relation of excitation and de&#8208;excitation, the impact of TR on luminescence spectra, and proposes future challengesthat need to be addressed, in order to raise more attention to the development of this field and relevant applications using TR characteristics.







Abstract
Recent progress on the temporal response (TR) of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion luminescence (UCL) has enriched the means of UCL regulation, promoted advanced designs for customized applications such as biological diagnosis, high&#8208;capacity optical coding, and dynamic optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and pushed us to reacquaint the dynamic responses of sensitizer/activator ions in UCL systems. In particular, the lifetime of UCL should be revisited after discovery of novel experimental phenomena and luminescence mechanisms, i.&#8201;e., it should be understood as the collective TR (in the decay edge) of all the involved ions rather than the reciprocal of the radiative rate of an individual ion. In this Concept, we retraced the latest understanding of the dynamics in UCL with special attention to the relationship between excitation and emission, means of TR regulation, and discussed existing challenges. It is expected to provide some fundamental insights to deepened understanding, further regulation, and frontier applications of TR features of UCL.

         <title>Site Selectivity of Peptoids as Azobenzene Scaffold for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptoids are introduced as programmable macromolecular scaffold to improve the solar energy storage properties of azobenzene. The anchoring position of the chromophore strongly affects the thermal back&#8208;isomerization kinetics with the longest half&#8208;life measured in this work (14&#8197;days) being larger than that of the isolated azobenzene unit (from 2 to 4&#8197;days).







Abstract
Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (t1/2&lt;4&#8197;days; &#916;H~270&#8197;kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene&#8208;based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3&#8208;unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half&#8208;life of the metastable form up to 14&#8197;days at 20&#8201;&#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development. We also highlight that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry does not only enable to monitor the different stereoisomers during the photoisomerization process as traditionally done, but also allows to determine the thermal back&#8208;isomerization kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;Peptoids are introduced as programmable macromolecular scaffold to improve the solar energy storage properties of azobenzene. The anchoring position of the chromophore strongly affects the thermal back-isomerization kinetics with the longest half-life measured in this work (14&#8197;days) being larger than that of the isolated azobenzene unit (from 2 to 4&#8197;days).

         <title>Modular Bicyclophane&#8208;Based Molecular Platforms</title>

         <dc:description>
Bicyclophane&#8208;based molecular platforms form extended 2D crystalline monolayers after adsorption from solution onto HOPG and contain orthogonal pillars that point towards the supernatant solution phase.







Abstract
The modular synthesis of a series of nanoscale phenylene bicyclophanes with an intraannular orthogonal pillar is described. The compounds are obtained by a Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling condensation and are characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as well as in&#8197;situ scanning tunneling microscopy at the solid/liquid interface of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. In addition, their structures and conformations are supported by quantum chemical calculations, also after adsorption to the substrate. A set of two alkyl chain substitution patterns as well as a combination of both were investigated with respect to their ability to form extended 2D&#8208;crystalline superstructures on graphite. It shows that not the most densely packed surface coverage gives the most stable structure, but the largest number of alkyl chains per molecule determines the structural robustness to alterations at the pillar functionality.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Yndiamides with Isoxazoles via &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Fischer Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles affords polysubstituted diaminopyrroles via the intermediacy of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions; high regioselectivity was achieved via a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents, as supported by DFT calculations. The reaction outcome could be switched to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines by using benzisoxazoles as substrates.







Abstract
Gold catalysis is an important method for alkyne functionalization. Here we report the gold&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles in a direct synthesis of polysubstituted diaminopyrroles, which are important motifs in drug discovery. Key to this process is the formation, and subsequent cyclization, of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene, which represents a new type of gold carbene intermediate. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions, with high regioselectivity being achieved by introducing a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents on the yndiamide. DFT calculations revealed that the key to this regioselectivity was the interconversion of isomeric gold keteniminiun ions via a low&#8208;barrier &#960;&#8208;complex transition state, which establishes a Curtin&#8208;Hammett scenario for isoxazole addition. By using benzisoxazoles as substrates, the reaction outcome could be switched to a formal [5+2] cyclization, leading to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines.

         <title>Modulating Strain in Twisted Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of twisted pyrene&#8208;fused twistacenes has been synthesized that allowed the investigation of the effects of different sterically&#8208;demanding groups on their structure and properties.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of strained aromatics provide an additional insight into the relationship between structure and properties. In the last years, several approaches to twist pyrene&#8208;fused azaacenes have been developed that allow to introduce twists of different sizes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a new set of twisted dibenzotetraazahexacenes constituted by fused pyrene and quinoxaline residues that have been distorted by introducing increasingly larger substituents on the quinoxaline residues. Their twisted structure has been demonstrated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, absorption, fluorescence, electrochemical and theoretical studies shine light on the effects of the substituents and twists on the optoelectronic and redox properties.

Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of several chiral (cyclopentadienone)iron complexes (CICs) featuring either two (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxes or a combination of one (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxis and a stereogenic plane. The stereoplane&#8208;containing CICs were obtained as epimer mixtures, which were separated by flash column chromatography and assigned an absolute configuration based on XRD analysis, NMR and order of elution. The library was tested in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones showing good catalytic activity and a moderate stereoselectivity which, notably, is mostly imparted by the stereogenic plane. Indeed, the two epimers of each CIC possessing a stereoplane show opposite and equally strong stereochemical preference.

The synthesis and structure of the first alkaline bismolyl contact ion pair [K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)]+[Bitet]&#8722; and the corresponding yttrium bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)2 are presented. Density functional theory calculations of the bismolyl anion revealed that the bismuth atom is in the +1 oxidation state and possesses a dominant mesomeric structure (50&#8201;%) where two lone pairs of electrons reside at the BiI center. Remarkably, the yttrium&#8208;bismuth bonding interaction is with 16.6&#8201;% at the yttrium center, which is large in rare earth chemistry. Bitet=[C4Me4Bi],







Abstract
The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] bismolyl Bitet (C4Me4Bi) contact ion pair (1) is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bitet anion of 1 features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the BiI center, as well as delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated C4Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand, as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)2 (2). The latter results from the salt metathesis reaction of KBitet with Cptet2Y(BPh4) (Cptet=C5Me4H). The Y&#8208;Bi bonding interaction in 2 of 16.6&#8201;% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Bi&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are presented. Density functional theory calculations of the bismolyl anion revealed that the bismuth atom is in the +1 oxidation state and possesses a dominant mesomeric structure (50&#8201;%) where two lone pairs of electrons reside at the Bi&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; center. Remarkably, the yttrium-bismuth bonding interaction is with 16.6&#8201;% at the yttrium center, which is large in rare earth chemistry. Bi&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt;=[C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Bi],

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18-crown-6)] bismolyl Bi&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Bi) contact ion pair (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bi&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt; anion of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the Bi&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; center, as well as delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;-conjugated C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand, as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cp&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Bi&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). The latter results from the salt metathesis reaction of KBi&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt; with Cp&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y(BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) (Cp&lt;sup&gt;tet&lt;/sup&gt;=C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H). The Y-Bi bonding interaction in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of 16.6&#8201;% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Upconversion of Pyrene Derivatives for Photoredox Catalysis via Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (1, 2, 3 and 4) via introducing aryl&#8208;alkynyl group onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA&#8208;UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl&#8208;alkynyl group increases. When combining 4 with palladium tetraphenyl&#8208;tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieve the highest red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3%) (out of a 50% maximum) so far. Then, this pair is used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630 nm), which achieves a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The result not only provides a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also shows the advantage of applying TTA&#8208;UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls into Chiral Conjugated Polycycles Incorporating Epoxyocyclooctadiene: a Two&#8208;Step Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles have garnered increasing attention due to versatile applications in optoelectronic materials and biological sciences. In this study, we report the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating a chiral epoxycyclooctadiene moiety. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on the novel reactions of hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved in two&#8208;step manner. Firstly, the TSS is regio&#8208;selectively transformed into its ortho&#8208;quinone form. Subsequently, the nucleophilic addition reactions of TSS ortho&#8208;quinone by phenylethynides are metal ion&#8208;dependent. When utilizing (phenylethynyl)magnesium bromide as the nucleophile, two phenylethynyls are furnished onto the edged benzene ring of TSS. When the nucleophile is (phenylethynyl)lithium, a cascade of nucleophilic addition, intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer, ring&#8208;opening, and tetradehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (TDDA) reactions occur sequentially in one&#8208;pot, ultimately affording chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles featuring the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety as an integral part of their backbones. This work represents a step forward in the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles using TSS as synthon.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Starbons&#174;: Methodology Development and Carbon Dioxide Capture Capability.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch. The materials are initially produced at 250&#8211;300 oC (SNx300y), then heated in vacuo to 800 oC to produce nitrogen&#8208;doped SNx800y&#8217;s. Melamine gives the highest nitrogen incorporation without destroying the Starbon&#174; pore structure and the microwave heating methods give higher nitrogen incorporations than thermal heating. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; determined gravimetrically, in many cases exceed those of S300 and S800. The carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane adsorption isotherms of the most promising materials are measured volumetrically. Most of the nitrogen&#8208;doped materials show higher carbon dioxide adsorption capacities than S800, but lower methane and nitrogen adsorption capacities. As a result, the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; exhibit significantly enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen and methane versus nitrogen selectivities compared to S800.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the catalytic activity of lipopeptide assemblies with nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biohybrid catalysts that operate in aqueous media are intriguing for systems chemistry. In this paper, we investigate whether control over the self&#8208;assembly of biohybrid catalysts can tune their properties. As a model, we use the catalytic activity of functional hybrid molecules consisting of a catalytic H&#8208;dPro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Glu tripeptide, derivatized with fatty acid and nucleobase moieties. This combination of simple biological components merged the catalytic properties of the peptide with the self&#8208;assembly of the lipid, and the structural ordering of the nucleobases. The biomolecule hybrids self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into fibrillar assemblies and catalyze the reaction between butanal and nitrostyrene. The interactions between the nucleobases enhanced the order of the supramolecular structures and affected their catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. The results point to the significant control and ordering that nucleobases can provide in the self&#8208;assembly of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>LixMoS2 is not only discussed as lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials.

The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirm a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern as for Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms.

         <title>Fluorinated Benzimidazole&#8208;Linked Highly Conjugated Polymer Enabling Covalent Polysulfide Anchoring for Stable Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical sources in the p&#8208;block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge&#8208;storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent dissolution feature in the electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this work, the synthetically designed fluorinated porous polymer, when treated with elemental sulfur through a well&#8208;known nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (SNAr), allows for the covalent integration of polysulfides into a highly conjugated benzimidazole polymer by replacing the fluorine atoms. Chemically robust benzimidazole linkages allow such harsh post&#8208;synthetic treatment and facilitate the electronic activation of the anchored polysulfides for redox reactions under applied potential. The electrode amalgamated with sulfurized polymer mitigates the so&#8208;called polysulfide shuttle effect in the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery and also enables a reversible, more environmentally friendly, and cheaper aluminum&#8208;sulfur (Al&#8208;S) battery that is configured with mostly p&#8208;block elements as cathode, anode, and electrolytes. The improved cycling stabilities and reduction of the overpotential in both cases pave the way for future sustainable energy storage solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical synthesis of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed. The electrochemical methodology uses only imidazolium salts, gold metal electrodes, and electricity to produce these complexes and the only by&#8208;product is hydrogen gas. This high&#8208;yielding and operationally simple procedure has been used to produce seven mononuclear and three dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes. The electrochemical procedure facilitates a clean reaction with no by&#8208;products. As such, Au&#8208;NHC complexes can be directly transferred to catalytic reactions without work&#8208;up or purification. The Au&#8208;NHC complexes were produced on&#8208;demand and tested as catalysts in a vinylcyclopropanation reaction. All mononuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes performed similarly to or better than the isolated complexes, showcasing how the electrochemical procedure can speed up catalyst screening and reaction development.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidants Controlled C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryltetrahydroisoquinolines: The Construction of the Quaternary Carbon Center and Cleavage of the C&#8208;N Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8208;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the N&#8208;nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Customized synthesis of MOF nanoplates via molecular scalpel strategy for efficient oxygen reduction in Zn&#8722;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88 V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2. This work clarifies the structure&#8208;morphology&#8208;reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties, which depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the pure correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing their molecular structures has been unexplored. Herein, we report the relative&#8208;position&#8208;control based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant luminescent property modulation. From anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines, six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared. Different alkylamines' steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624 nm and different luminescence processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tandem quinolines dearomatization/functionalization is a huge challenge. We show here that the low&#8208;valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 is able to catalyze such bis&#8208;borylation process. NMR and labelling studies prove a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration/Markovnikov hydroboration cascade, starting from an in&#8197;situ formed paramagnetic complex. DFT highlights the importance of a cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction, and bring rationalizations on the C4 selectivity.







Abstract
We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8722;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in&#8197;situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.

We show here that the low-valent HCo(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is able to catalyze such bis-borylation process. NMR and labelling studies prove a 1,2-hydroboration/Markovnikov hydroboration cascade, starting from an in&#8197;situ formed paramagnetic complex. DFT highlights the importance of a cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction, and bring rationalizations on the C4 selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein a mild stereo- and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high-valued 1,4-bis-borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post-modification of the resulting C&#8722;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in&#8197;situ generated paramagnetic bis-quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)-catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;assisted Arylation of Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple A: Addition&#8208;Assisted Arylation methods which make use of Lewis base&#8208;generated enolates are described in this concept. Different fields of synthetic organic chemistry are covered, including transition metal catalysis, hypervalent main group element&#8208;centered rearrangements and organocatalyzed aryl&#8208;migration reactions. The conceptual similarities and differences are briefly discussed with the goal to apply this strategy in future method development.







Abstract
The combination of Lewis bases with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls allows the in&#8208;situ generation of enolates without the need for strong Br&#248;nsted bases. Recently developed synthetic methods employ this approach for arylation followed by elimination of the Lewis base, regenerating the alkene. This strategy has been deployed for formal &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation in different contexts, namely (a) transition metal catalysis, (b) rearrangement reactions utilizing hypervalent main group elements and (c) organocatalysis. This concept article provides an overview of the developed strategies, highlighting and contextualizing their features.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water harvesting from the air: three covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized by incorporating different content of nitrogen. Higher nitrogen content is advantageous to lower their inflection points in water isotherms. The high performance of these COFs validated the feasibility of harnessing this strategy to prepare efficient COFs&#8208;based water harvesters.







Abstract
Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of their water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retains its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.

         <title>Tailoring Secondary Coordination Sphere Effects in Single&#8208;metal&#8208;site Catalysts by Surface Immobilization of Supramolecular Cages</title>

Cage control: Surface immobilization of supramolecular cages gives control over the first&#8208; and second coordination spheres of heterogeneous catalysts, enabling diffusion&#8208;controlled reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Controlling the coordination sphere of heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts is a powerful strategy for fine&#8208;tuning their catalytic properties but is fairly difficult to achieve. To address this problem, we immobilized supramolecular cages where the primary&#8208; and secondary coordination sphere are controlled by ligand design. The kinetics of these catalysts were studied in a model reaction, the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, over a temperature range using fast and precise online measurements generating high&#8208;precision Arrhenius plots. The results show how catalytic properties can be enhanced by placing a well&#8208;defined reaction pocket around the active site. Our fine&#8208;tuning yielded a catalyst with such performance that the reaction kinetics are diffusion&#8208;controlled rather than chemically controlled.

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode could efficiently electrocatalytic reduce CO2 to CO in CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% [Bmim]PF6&#8208;65&#8197;wt% CH3CN&#8208;5&#8197;wt% H2O electrolyte. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode was closely associated with its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. Surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction. Herein, hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.&#8201;e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3&#8201;% and the current density achieves 23.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65&#8197;wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5&#8197;wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85&#8201;% at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu and Ag capsules accommodate various organic molecules. We investigated the processes by which these capsules perform molecular recognition utilizing a molecular probe. It was found that partial dissociation is a major molecular recognition process, while in some cases, slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation.







Abstract
Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in the Cu and Ag capsules by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and 1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo the partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. The slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron&#8208;rich p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group and the electron&#8208;poor 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without the partial dissociation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cu and Ag capsules accommodate various organic molecules&lt;/b&gt;. We investigated the processes by which these capsules perform molecular recognition utilizing a molecular probe. It was found that partial dissociation is a major molecular recognition process, while in some cases, slippage also contributes to host-guest complexation.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ru Nanoboxes with a Hexagonal Close&#8208;Packed Structure by Templating with Ag Nanocubes and Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boxing clever: We report a facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes by templating with Ag nanocubes. The nanoboxes show high catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenol by NaBH4.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and highly efficient use of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a solution of Ru(acac)3 in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise to a suspension of silver nanocubes in EG at 170&#8201;&#176;C, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the RuIII precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluated the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses by using a model hydrogenation reaction; both samples showed excellent performance.

         <title>Second Generation of Near&#8208;Infrared Cyanine&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Faster Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities in oxidation (aza&#8208;Henry reaction) and reduction (trifluoromethylation of alkene).







Abstract
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities. Catalyst efficiency was determined by using two model oxidation and reduction reactions. For the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain led to the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.

         <title>A Living Topochemical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Achiral Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;Anhydrides in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid&#8208; (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid&#8208; (ACHC) N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Topochemical, living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of these achiral amino&#8208;acid NCAs produces polymers of highest purity with increased chain length and high end&#8208;group fidelity as compared to conventional solution polymerization.







Abstract
A living topochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of achiral amino&#8208;acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. The single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40&#8197;units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer's head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.

         <title>Long&#8208;range Through&#8208;space Charge Transfer in a pH&#8208;responsive Mixed Cyclophane of Pyridine and Teropyrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;distance relationship: two aromatic systems do not need to inhabit the same space to maintain a meaningful connection, as evidenced by the long&#8208;range (&gt;5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space charge transfer that arises upon protonation of the pyridine unit in a mixed [3.3]cyclophane containing a rainbow&#8208;shaped teropyrene and a pyridine nested in its arc.







Abstract
A large, strained (SE=44.2&#8197;kcal/mol) and conformationally flexible mixed cyclophane of pyridine and teropyrene was synthesized using two intramolecular Wurtz coupling reactions and an unprecedented Scholl reaction between the unreactive 2 positions of the pyrene systems in a triply bridged pyrenophane. Protonation of the pyridine unit results in a greatly enhanced preference for nesting in the cavity of the highly bent teropyrene system (&#952;calc=162.6&#176;) and emergence of a charge transfer absorption band (&#955;max=592&#8197;nm) due to a long range (5.0&#8211;5.5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space intramolecular transition between the teropyrene and pyridinium units, which does not exist in the neutral cyclophane.

         <dc:description>
Mn(I) complexes of the type [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], bearing a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), have been synthesized by transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes, and fully characterized in solution and in the solid state. The catalytic performances of the complexes have been evaluated in the reductive formylation and methylation of anilines with CO2.

A series of six Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], having a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by in&#8197;situ transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)3(CH3CN)](BF4). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)&#8208;bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive N&#8208;formylation and N&#8208;methylation of amines with CO2 as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the N&#8208;methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal&#8208;catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.

         <title>Biomass Separators as a &#8220;Lifesaver&#8221; for Safe and Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the application of biomass materials in lithium&#8208;metal battery separators. Three types of separators are outlined and the different mechanisms of biomass separators with different structures in inhibiting the generation of lithium dendrites and shuttle effect are described.







Abstract
The growth of lithium dendrites and the shuttle of polysulfides in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have hindered their development. In LMBs, the cathode and anode are separated by a separator, although this does not solve the battery&#8216;s issues. The use of biomass materials is widespread for modifying the separator due to their porous structure and abundant functional groups. LMBs perform more electrochemically when lithium ions are deposited uniformly and polysulfide shuttling is reduced using biomass separators. In this review, we analyze the growth of lithium dendrite and the shuttle of polysulfide in LMBs, summarize the types of biomass separator materials and the mechanisms of action (providing mechanical barriers, promoting uniform deposition of metal ions, capturing polysulfides, shielding polysulfide). The prospect of developing new separator materials from the perspective of regulating ion transport and physical sieving efficiency as well as the application of advanced technologies such as synchrotron radiation to characterize the mechanism of action of biomass separators is also proposed.

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of buckycatcher based on two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties was synthesized and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations show a shape fit of the catcher cavity for fullerene binding. Interactions were confirmed for C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).







Abstract
A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized via cross&#8208;coupling of two bowl shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The obtained catcher has been unambiguously characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations indicate that the curved shape of the receptor moieties is favourable for binding fullerenes. Effective binding was confirmed for interactions with C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity.

         <title>Vanadium(V) Pyridine&#8208;Containing Schiff Base Catecholate Complexes are Lipophilic, Redox&#8208;Active and Selectively Cytotoxic in Glioblastoma (T98G) Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium(V) catecholates are promising agents for intratumoral injections to treat glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. We report a novel promising analog abbreviated [VO(SALIEP)(DTB)] that is highly selective towards glioblastoma cells and nontoxic to normal cells due to the presence of the pyridine ring on the Schiff base. This is the first structure&#8208;activity study to establish this scaffold, which allows high toxicity against glioblastoma (T98G) cells.







Abstract
Two new series of complexes with pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff bases, [VVO(SALIEP)L] and [VVO(Cl&#8208;SALIEP)L] (SALIEP=N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine; Cl&#8208;SALIEP=N&#8208;(5&#8208;chlorosalicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)pyridine, L=catecholato(2&#8722;) ligand) have been synthesized. Characterization by 1H and 51V&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1)&#8197;most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholato(2&#8722;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2)&#8197;tert&#8208;butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced VIV species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to VIV occurred for the unsubstituted&#8208;catecholato VV complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VVO(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti&#8208;proliferative activity (IC50 6.7&#177;0.9&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non&#8208;cancerous human cell line, HFF&#8208;1 (IC50 34&#177;10&#8197;&#956;M). This made [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injection.

&lt;p&gt;Vanadium(V) catecholates are promising agents for intratumoral injections to treat glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. We report a novel promising analog abbreviated [VO(SALIEP)(DTB)] that is highly selective towards glioblastoma cells and nontoxic to normal cells due to the presence of the pyridine ring on the Schiff base. This is the first structure-activity study to establish this scaffold, which allows high toxicity against glioblastoma (T98G) cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new series of complexes with pyridine-containing Schiff bases, [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)L] and [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(Cl-SALIEP)L] (SALIEP=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(salicylideneaminato)-2-(2-aminoethylpyridine; Cl-SALIEP=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(5-chlorosalicylideneaminato)-2-(2-aminoethyl)pyridine, L=catecholato(2&#8722;) ligand) have been synthesized. Characterization by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;V&#8197;NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1)&#8197;most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylcatecholato(2&#8722;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2)&#8197;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(salicylideneaminato)-&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; occurred for the unsubstituted-catecholato V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(HSHED)(DTB)]. [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti-proliferative activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 6.7&#177;0.9&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non-cancerous human cell line, HFF-1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 34&#177;10&#8197;&#956;M). This made [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A two&#8208;level molecular stack composed of a point&#8208;chiral element (&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl) is shown. Operators are setting the key noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonds) that allow efficient and persistent stereocommunication between the two levels. This approach enables fine tuning of chiroptical properties of the cage&#8208;like molecule with stimuli such as solvent and temperature. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates by Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) has been adopted for the preparation of partially fluorinated methyl and ethyl triflates, which are established reagents in organofluorine chemistry. The ECF process is easily scalable and only requires readily available starting compounds and electricity. Thus, it is fun to use this sustainable method for the synthesis of valuable chemicals, as highlighted by the cover picture showing molecules in Simons Fluorination Fun Park. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Finze and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302701). The cover picture was designed by Thomas Neubert.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOFs with Enriched Surface Bi Active Sites for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOF with enriched surface Bi active sites were obtained by modulating the crystal facet ingeniously. The knitting of Bi active sites onto the porphyrin ligands with the exposure of rich Bi sites can not only ameliorate the light absorption, but also stabilize the catalytic active sites and promote efficient ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, for significantly ameliorating the performance of photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4.







Abstract
The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimal photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1) and CH4 (8.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo2O4/CF maintains the flexibility of the carbon foam framework during a simple hydrothermal and annealing process. Applying foam carbon as a standalone electrode overcomes the limitation of low specific capacitance. It addresses the significant challenge of NiCo2O4 nanoparticle aggregation, achieving suitable specific capacitance and efficient microwave absorption performance.







Abstract
Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor&#8216;s electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5&#8197;F/g at 1&#8197;A/g. When the current density was set to 1&#8197;A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7&#8197;F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10&#8197;A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2&#8201;% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5&#8197;W/kg, an energy density of 22.1&#8197;Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material&#8216;s microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.

         <title>Utilising the Nanozymatic Activity of Copper&#8208;Functionalised Mesoporous C3N5 for Sensing Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Copper&#8208;functionalised mesoporous carbon nitride which has been synthesised with a higher nitrogen content (Cu&#8722;C3N5) and applied in the biosensing of various biomolecules, including glutathione and glucose.







Abstract
Designing unique nanomaterials for the selective sensing of biomolecules is of significant interest in the field of nanobiotechnology. In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of ordered Cu nanoparticle&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 that has unique peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymatic activity for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of glucose and glutathione. A nano hard&#8208;templating technique together with the in&#8208;situ polymerisation and self&#8208;assembly of Cu and high N&#8208;containing CN precursor was adopted to introduce mesoporosity as well as high N and Cu content in mesoporous C3N5. Due to the ordered structure and highly dispersed Cu in the mesoporous C3N5, a large enhancement of the peroxidase mimetic activity in the oxidation of a redox dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be obtained. Additionally, the optimised Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 exhibited excellent sensitivity to glutathione with a low detection limit of 2.0&#8197;ppm. The strong peroxidase activity of the Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 was also effectively used for the sensing of glucose with a detection limit of 0.4&#8197;mM through glucose oxidation with glucose oxidase. This unique Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 has the potential for detecting various molecules in the environment as well as for next&#8208;generation glucose and glutathione diagnostic devices.

         <title>Solvent Acts as the Referee in a Match&#8208;Up Between Charged and Preorganized Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent dependent binding: Herein, a cationic receptor was employed to quantify chloride binding in solvents of differing polarity and draw comparison to a neutral, preorganized macrocycle. As expected, ion&#8208;ion attraction leads to stronger binding but only in low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane. Unexpectedly, the neutral receptor wins the competition for binding in polar solvents due to being preorganized.







Abstract
The prevalence of anion&#8208;cation contacts in biomolecular recognition under aqueous conditions suggests that ionic interactions should dominate the binding of anions in solvents across both high and low polarities. Investigations of this idea using titrations in low polarity solvents are impaired by interferences from ion pairing that prevent a clear picture of binding. To address this limitation and test the impact of ion&#8208;ion interactions across multiple solvents, we quantified chloride binding to a cationic receptor after accounting for ion pairing. In these studies, we created a chelate receptor using aryl&#8208;triazole CH donors and a quinolinium unit that directs its cationic methyl inside the binding pocket. In low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 7.3) is more stable than neutral chelates, but fortuitously comparable to a preorganized macrocycle (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 6.9). Polar acetonitrile and DMSO diminish stabilities of the charged receptor (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 3.7 and 1.9) but surprisingly 100&#8208;fold more than the macrocycle. While both receptors lose stability by dielectric screening of electrostatic stability, the cationic receptor also pays additional costs of organization. Thus even though the charged receptor has stronger binding in apolar solvents, the uncharged receptor has more anion affinity in polar solvents.

         <title>Structure and Flexibility of Copper&#8208;Modified DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes Investigated by 19F ENDOR Experiments at 34&#8197;GHz

19F ENDOR&#8208;based distance measurements at 34&#8197;GHz report on the structure and flexibility of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our findings show that measuring precise distances at 34&#8197;GHz is feasible without the loss of sensitivity and resolution.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) are of great interest due to their involvement in crucial biological processes such as telomerase maintenance and gene expression. Furthermore, they are reported as catalytically active DNAzymes and building blocks in bio&#8208;nanotechnology. GQs exhibit remarkable structural diversity and conformational heterogeneity, necessitating precise and reliable tools to unravel their structure&#8208;function relationships. Here, we present insights into the structure and conformational flexibility of a unimolecular GQ with high spatial resolution via electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments combined with Cu(II) and fluorine labeling. These findings showcase the successful application of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR methodology at 34&#8197;GHz, overcoming the limitations posed by the complexity and scarcity of higher&#8208;frequency spectrometers. Importantly, our approach retains both sensitivity and orientational resolution. This integrated study not only enhances our understanding of GQs but also expands the methodological toolbox for studying other macromolecules.

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local CO2 concentration matters for electrochemical CO2 reduction in terms of the activity and selectivity. This review summarizes the bioinspired hydrophobicity design of catalysts and other strategies including catalysts modification, electrolytes selection, and electrolyzers engineering for CO2 enrichment to realize enhanced CO2R performance. This review is expected to provide a guidance for the development of practical electrocatalytic CO2R systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gases due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.

         <dc:description>Abstract: Alkali nitridophosphates AP4N7 and A3P6N11 (A&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been known for decades. However, their Li homologues have remained elusive. In this work, the highly condensed lithium (imido)nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x (x&#160;=&#160;1.66(3)) were synthesized from LiPN2 and P3N5 in the multianvil press at 10&#160;GPa. They constitute the first lithium nitridophosphates with 3D networks exhibiting a degree of condensation larger than 0.5 and high thermal stability. LiP4N7 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a&#160;=&#160;4.5846(6)&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;8.0094(11)&#160;&#197;, and c&#160;=&#160;13.252(2)&#160;&#197; (Z&#160;=&#160;4). Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x crystallizes in the triclinic space group P &#160;with Z&#160;=&#160;2, a&#160;=&#160;4.6911(11)&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;7.024(2)&#160;&#197;, c&#160;=&#160;12.736(3)&#160;&#197;, &#945;&#160;=&#160;87.726(11), &#946;&#160;=&#160;80.279(11), and &#947;&#160;=&#160;70.551(12)&#176;. Both compounds are stable against hydrolysis in air.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII complexes upon varying the N substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes 1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1a), a phenyl (Ph, 1b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1c) group or an H atom (1d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8208;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1a&#8208;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2a&#8208;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3a&#8208;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>10 &#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, &#160;and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging condition. Here, we fabricated 10&#8211;20 &#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7). The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possesses and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance.&#160;Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5 Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08 Ah at high charging rate of 6 C (77.9% of that at 0.2 C of 6.52 Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352% for 250 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2mg/g and 66.6 mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Scholl Reaction on Phenylated Cyclopentadiene Core: One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Fluoreno[5]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Exploring the role of metal in the biointeraction of metallacarboranes with C. elegans embryos.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in vitro and recently in vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans , a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8208; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8208;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8208; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8208;).
In this work, we use the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Support Engineering for the Stabilisation of Heterogeneous Pd3P&#8208;Based Catalysts for Heck Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the use of a supported Pd3P catalyst for Heck coupling reactions. For the stabilisation of Pd3P and Pd, as reference system, the silica support material was modified via phosphorus doping (0.5 and 1 wt.% P). Through this so&#8208;called support engineering approach, the catalytic activity of Pd3P was clearly enhanced. Whereas an iodobenzene conversion of 79% was witnessed for Pd3P@SiO2 in the coupling of styrene and iodobenzene in 1h, 90% conversion could be achieved using Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2. This improved catalytic activity probably stems from an electronic modulation of the support surface via the introduction of phosphorus. Simultaneously, the recyclability was boosted and the Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2 catalyst has shown to maintain its catalytic activity over several recovery tests. Hereby, metal leaching could almost be suppressed completely to 3% by the use of a P&#8208;modified silica support.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Perchlorate Sensing using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils (semiaza&#8208;BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes.&#160;Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)63&#8208;/4&#8208; as a redox probe, together with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors' packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration&#8208;dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza&#8208;BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8208;100 mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, I&#8208;, AcO&#8208;, H2PO4&#8208;, HPO42&#8208;, SO42&#8208;, NO2&#8208;, NO3&#8208;, or CO32&#8208;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100 times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Diborynes versus Destabilization of Diborenes by Coordination of Lewis Bases. Unraveling the Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically investigated the boron&#8211;boron bonds in B2, diborynes B2L2, and diborenes B2H2L2 (L = none, OH2, NH3) using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. B2 has effectively a single B&#8211;B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds, whereas B2H2 has effectively a double B=B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds and one &#963; 2p&#8208;2p bond. This different electronic structure causes B2 and B2H2 to react differently to the addition of ligands. Thus, in B2L2, electron&#8208;donating ligands shorten and strengthen the boron&#8211;boron bond whereas, in B2H2L2, they lengthen and weaken the boron&#8211;boron bond. The aforementioned variations in boron&#8211;boron bond length and strength become more pronounced as the Lewis basicity of the ligands L increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Pentagon&#8208;Embedded Expanded [11]Helicenes for Radiative Cooling Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes have been designed and synthesized in a three&#8208;step process, which are the first example of carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene. TD&#8208;DFT analyses indicate that both of them possess high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29 kcal/mol and 40.76 kcal/mol, respectively. They emit strong red fluorescence and can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals upon addition of AgSbF6 evidenced by the bathochromic&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and the appearance of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. In addition, such helical derivatives can be chosen as radiative cooling materials in a glass model house, and the maxima of 5.4 oC for the former and 6.5 oC for the latter are found in the comparative tests, which might be caused by the NIR reflective response.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Tuned Structural Modulation and Nonlinear Optical Effects of Metal&#8208;Ion Directed 310&#8208;Helix Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metals play an important role in the structure and functions of various proteins. The combination of metal ions and peptides have been emerging as an attractive field to create advanced structures and biomaterials. Here, we are reporting the anion&#8208;influenced, silver ion coordinated diverse networks of designed short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups. The short peptides adopted classical right&#8208;handed, left&#8208;handed and 310EL&#8208;helical conformations in the presence of different silver salts. The peptides have displayed conformational flexibility to accommodate different sizes and interactions of anions to yield a variety of metal&#8208;coordinated networks. The complexes of metal ions and peptides have shown different porous networks, right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical polymers, transformation of helix into superhelix and 2:2 metal&#8208;peptide macrocycles. Further, the metal&#8208;peptide crystals with inherent dipoles of helical peptides gave striking second harmonic generation response. The optical energy upconversion from NIR to red light is demonstrated. Overall, we have shown the utilization of short 310&#8208;helices for the construction of diverse metal&#8208;coordinated helical networks and notable non&#8208;linear optical effects.</dc:description>

Further, the metal-peptide crystals with inherent dipoles of helical peptides gave striking second harmonic generation response. The optical energy upconversion from NIR to red light is demonstrated. Overall, we have shown the utilization of short 310-helices for the construction of diverse metal-coordinated helical networks and notable non-linear optical effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Triggering BODIPYs: an Ultrasensitive Chromogenic and Fluorogenic Sensing Platform for Perfluorooctanesulfonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contamination of water supplies by polyfluoroalkyl substances, notably perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has serious health and environmental consequences. Therefore, the development of straightforward and effective means of monitoring and removing PFASs is urgently required. In this study, we report a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of PFOS and PFOA in water that rely on the J&#8208;aggregate formation of meso&#8208;ester&#8208;BODIPY dyes. The dye C10&#8208;mim, which contains a hydrophilic methylimidazolium group and a hydrophobic alkylated BODIPY, self&#8208;assembles in water into weakly green&#8208;emissive micellar assemblies. Upon binding to PFOS or PFOA, a spontaneous disassembly and reorganization forms orange&#8208;emissive J&#8208;aggregates. The rapid formation (&#8804;&#160;5 s) of J&#8208;aggregates and the accompanying spectral shifts provide a superior sensing performance, with excellent sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.18 ppb for PFOS) and distinct chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic&#160;synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes: From chemoselectivity to enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a crucial class of functional molecules in organosilicon chemistry, silanols are found valuable applications in the fields of modern science and will be a potentially powerful framework for biologically active compounds or functional materials. It has witnessed an increasing demand for non&#8208;natural organosilanols, as well as the progress in the synthesis of these structural features. From the classic preparative methods to the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrosilanes, electrochemical hydrolysis of hydrosilanes, and then the construction of the most challenging silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols. This review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Dimers Versus Solid&#8208;State Dimers of N&#8208;Heteropolycycles: Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy in Concert with Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, matrix isolation spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas&#8208;phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid&#8208;state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells based on the Efficient Interaction between Pb2+ and Cyano Groups of 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects present on the top surface of perovskite films have a pronounced detrimental impact on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the development of effective defect passivation strategies has become key in enhancing both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In this study, a small molecule material, 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile (4&#8208;APN), was introduced as a means to mitigate surface defects within perovskite films. Obviously, 4&#8208;APN effectively passivates the defects at grain boundaries by combining cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) with Pb2+, significantly reducing the density of defect states, inhibiting non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface, and promoting the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. The 4&#8208;APN modification led to a significant upswing in the PCE, while concurrently bolstering the overall device stability. Importantly, the devices on 4&#8208;APN as passivation additive exhibited negligible performance degradation aging for 1200 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy&#8208;groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module 7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Simple Arenes into Complex (Amino)cyclitols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. Herein, we report the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. Herein, we report the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations.

         <title>Regular Arrays of Rod&#8208;Shaped Molecular Photoswitches: Synthesis, Preparation, Characterization, and Selective Photoswitching within Mono&#8208; and Bilayer Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores (diarylethene&#8208;based switch and unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor), we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light. UV&#8211;vis analysis confirmed smooth and unrestricted photoisomerization. To achieve this, we synthesized a new class of triptycene&#8208;based molecular pedestals adept at forming sturdy Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films on a water&#8211;air interface. The films were smoothly transferred to gold and quartz surfaces. Repeated deposition afforded bilayer systems: one layer containing diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitches and the other a unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor. Structural analysis of both mono&#8208; and bilayer systems revealed the molecules to be tilted with carboxylic functions pointing to the surface. At least two different polymorphs differing in monolayer thickness and tilt angle (&#8275;40&#176; and &#8275;60&#176;) were identified on the gold surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the&#160;influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, i.e., the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Stabilization of Phosphinate Ester&#8208;Containing Rhodamines Yields Cell Permeable Probes for Turn&#8208;On Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that uses pulsed laser excitation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non&#8208;radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes, affording cell permeable probes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we construct the first cell permeable rhodamine&#8208;based, turn&#8208;on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with maximal absorbance within the range of commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700&#8208;HOCl, is capable of detecting exogenous HOCl in mice. This work provides a new set of rhodamine&#8208;based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI. In the long term, the reagents described herein could be utilized to enable non&#8208;invasive imaging of HOCl in disease&#8208;relevant model systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrioids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrioids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers featuring a restricted rotational axis have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8208;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8208;N pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole, N&#8208;N pyrroleindole, N&#8208;N indole&#8208;indole, and N&#8208;N indole&#8208;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#176;C) = sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation and dynamic/assembly characteristics of vase&#8208;shaped basket&#160;13&#8208;&#160;along with its ability to form an inclusion complex with anticancer drug mitoxantrone in abiotic and biotic systems.&#160;This novel cavitand has a deep nonpolar pocket consisting of three naphthalimide sides fused to a bicyclic platform at the bottom while carrying polar glycines at the top.

         <title>On the Number of &#960;&#8208;Electrons Involved in Stepwise Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent, where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Structural Transformation of Non&#8208;Porous Propyl&#8208;Malonate Hexakis[60]fullerene by Chloroform Uptake/Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of dynamic structures with high recognition host&#8208;guest materials capable to host selectively small volatile molecules is an emergent field of research with both fundamental and applied implications. The challenge of exploring novel materials with advanced functionalities has led to the development of dynamic crystalline structures promoted by soft interactions.&#160;
Here, a new pure organic dynamic frameworks based on hexakis[60]fullerene that are held together by weak van der Waals interactions is described. This crystalline structure is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform, through internal structural reorganization. This research provides new insight into the design of organic molecular crystals for selective adsorption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine diazo reagents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several hypervalent iodine diazo reagents were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo reagents have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, hypervalent iodine diazo reagents can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of hypervalent iodine diazo compounds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration and Solvent&#8208;Induced Chiral Tuning by Manipulating Non&#8209;Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Glycoconjugate Supra&#8208;Scaffolds: Interaction with Protein, and Streptomycin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral tuning of the fibrous assemblies of two novel glycoconjugates Z&#8208;P(Gly)&#8208;Glu and Z&#8208;F(4&#8208;N)&#8208;Glu made by chemical attachment of Cbz&#8208;protected [short as Z)] non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine [short as P(Gly)] and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine [short as F(4&#8208;N)] with D&#8208;glucosamine [short as Glu]. Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4 nm.&#160; After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Activation of Drug (Derivative) Molecules with Pd(ll) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianions. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and in melts by direct fusion of the reactants yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms. The [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical (QC) calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon in situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Polymers Without Conventional Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Sensors Based on Covalent Organic Framworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of crystalline porous polymer composed of light elements through strong covalent bonds. COFs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique designable structures and excellent material properties. Currently, COFs have shown outstanding potential in various fields, including gas storage, pollutant removal, catalysis, adsorption, optoelectronics, and their research in the sensing field is also increasingly flourishing. In this review, we focus on COF&#8208;based sensors. Firstly, we elucidate the fundamental principles of COF&#8208;based sensors. Then, we present the primary application areas of COF&#8208;based sensors and their recent advancements, encompassing gas, ions, organic compounds, and biomolecules sensing. Finally, we discuss the future trends and challenges faced by COF&#8208;based sensors, outlining their promising prospects in the field of sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>A discrete, boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a&#160; neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) was demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14 mA mg&#8211;1Pt) and stability (317.69 mA mg&#8211;1 Pt after 2 h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88 V) and high stability (92.71% after 22 h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles to apply in other fields of energy as well as the environment.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;-&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well-dispersed MoS2. By using the N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS2).
