         <title>Binding properties of small electrophilic anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X = Cl, Br, I): Activation of small molecules based on &#960;&#8208;backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superelectrophilic anions constitute a special class of molecular anions, which show strong binding of weak nucleophiles despite their negative charge. In this study, the binding characteristics of smaller gaseous electrophilic anions of the types [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (with X = Cl, Br, I) are computationally and experimentally investigated and compared to those of the larger analogues [B12X11]&#8722;. The positive charge of vacant boron increases from [B6X5]&#8722; via [B10X9]&#8722; to [B12X11]&#8722;, as evidenced by increasing attachment enthalpies towards typical &#963;&#8208;donor molecules (noble gases, H2O). However, this behavior is reversed for &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules. [B6Cl5]&#8722; binds strongest to N2 and CO, even stronger than to H2O. Energy decomposition analysis confirms that the orbital interaction is responsible for this opposite trend. The extended transition state&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence method shows that the &#960;&#8208;backdonation order is [B6X5]&#8722; &gt; [B10X9]&#8722; &gt; [B12X11]&#8722;. This predicted order explains the experimentally observed red shifts of the CO and N2 stretching fundamentals compared to those of the unbound molecules measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. The strongest red shift is observed for [B6Cl5N2]&#8722;: 222 cm&#8208;1. Therefore, strong activation of unreactive &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules (commonly observed for cationic transition metal complexes) is achieved with metal&#8208;free molecular anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photochromic Properties of Diaryl [5]Helicene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced tuning of aromaticity and correlative molecular properties has attracted enormous interest in recent years for both modulating photochromism properties and designing novel photochromic materials. Here, we report on the synthesis and photochemical characterizations investigation of diaryl[5]helicene based diarylethene molecular switches. 3,4&#8208;Bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 1a showed no photochromic reaction, while 3,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 2a and 3,4&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylthiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 3a exhibited reversible photochromism in different aprotic solvents with specific light irradiation. Meanwhile, the diarylethene compounds 2a and 3a underwent turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitchings together with the photoisomerization reaction upon light irradiation. Remarkably, the photoinduced changes in aromaticity of [5]helicene as a central ethene bridge along with the relative smaller activation energy and higher frequency factor facilitated the thermal bleaching rates of diarylethene switches 2 and 3 in solution. This research provides a new insight for designing aromatic diarylethene photoswitches for reversible fluorescence switching behaviour, photoinduced changes in aromaticity and further fast thermal back reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction and Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of a Supramolecular Metal&#8210;Carbene Complex with Multifunctional Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical combinations involving metal&#8210;ligand interactions and host&#8210;guest interactions can consolidate building blocks with unique functions into material properties. Herein, we reported the construction and hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex containing three crown ether units and three ferrocene units. In addition, we investigated the host&#8210;guest interactions between multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex and organic ammonium salts, revealing crown ether&#8208;based host&#8210;guest interactions can effectively regulate the electrochemical properties of the complex. Utilizing bisammonium salt as the cross&#8208;linker and multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex as the core, we successfully obtained a stimuli&#8208;responsive and self&#8208;healing supramolecular gel with different functional units.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of Adamantane&#8208;Modified Dyes in Aqueous Solution via Supramolecular Interaction with Methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and Their Application in Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorescence of functional dyes was generally quenched in aqueous solution, which hindered their application in water&#8208;bearing detections. In this work, a novel strategy based on host&#8208;guest interaction was provided for the purpose of fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution and cell imaging. Three adamantane&#8208;modified fluorescent dyes (Coum&#8208;Ad, NP&#8208;Ad, NR&#8208;Ad) with coumarin, 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Nile Red as fluorophores were initially designed and prepared. The ((adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)amino group, as the auxochrome of these dyes, complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) via supramolecular interaction, and then fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) were formed by self&#8208;assembly in water. The inclusion equilibrium constant (K) could be as high as 3.94&#215;104 M&#8208;1. With the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes were separately improved to 69.8%, 32.9% and 41.3%. Inspired by the above satisfactory results, six adamantane&#8208;modified probes organelle&#8208;NPAds with organelle&#8208;targeting capability were further obtained. As the formation of hydrogen bonds between organelle&#8208;NPAd2 and M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD verified by theoretical calculation, K of organelle&#8208;NPAd2 (5.13&#215;104 M&#8208;1 ~ 4.53&#215;105 M&#8208;1) with M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD was higher than that of organelle&#8208;NPAd1 (1.15&#215;104 M&#8208;1 ~ 3.66&#215;104 M&#8208;1) and their fluorescence quantum yields increased to 32.8% ~ 83.6% in aqueous solution. In addition, fluorescence enhancement was realized in cell imaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving the Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Chalcone based Donor&#8208;Acceptor System through Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, understanding the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has become the primary choice for designing high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, metal&#8208;free organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we propose a strategically designed chalcone based donor&#8208;acceptor system, where intensification of delayed fluorescence with decrease in temperature (300K to 100K) is observed; the theoretical investigations of electronic states and orbital characters uncovered a new cold rISC pathway in donor&#8208;acceptor system, where rISC occurs through the down&#8208;conversation of higher triplet exciton (from T3) to lowest singlet state (S1), having negative energy splitting, thus no thermal energy is required. The comprehensive research described herein might open&#8208;up new avenues in donor&#8208;acceptor system over the conventional up&#8208;convention of triplet exciton and demonstrates that not necessarily all delayed fluorescence are thermally activated (TADF).</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Silylyne Complex of Molybdenum: Synthesis, Properties, and Access to Silaiminoacyl Complexes via [2+3] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in solution. The replacement of the central metal from W to Mo led to a monomer dominant (~98%) solution at room temperature. The monomer&#8208;dimer dynamics was investigated based on thermodynamic parameters. The molybdenum silylyne complex underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with alkynes much faster than the tungsten analog. The reactions with organic azides led to the formation of the first example of silaiminoacyl complexes through [2+3] cycloaddition. The structure and bonding aspects of the products were clarified by multiple measurements and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing Turns and Twists: Unraveling the One&#8208;Step Synthesis, Intricate Pathways, and Structural Revelations of N&#8208;Aryl Aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes</title>

         <dc:description>We report the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes starting from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The intermediacy of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene is investigated, and the Scholl oxidative cyclization route is invoked here to overcome the large strain during the formation of N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene. Notably, this transformation occurs without the need for directing groups and proceeds from a more helical to a less helical pathway. Both the N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene and N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene are confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. The enantiomers of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene are separated by chiral HPLC and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate their chiroptical properties. However, N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene racemizes rapidly. The radical cations generated from aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near&#8208;IR region and air stability up to 24 h. Optical and electrochemical studies with helicene and quasicirculene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bond Catalysis with Telluronium Cations for Bromination Reaction: Importance of Electrostatic and Polarization Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chalcogen bond catalysts&#160;with telluronium cations have garnered considerable attention in organic reactions. In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis on the bromination reaction of anisole with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) with the telluronium cationic catalysts has been explored with density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction is divided into two stages: the bromine transfer step and the proton transfer step. Based on the computational results, one can find the rate&#8208;determining step is the bromine transfer step. Moreover, the present study elucidates that a stronger chalcogen bond (ChB) between catalysts and NBS will give better catalytic performance. Additionally, this work also clarified the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the chalcogen bond between the oxygen atom of NBS and the Te atom of the catalyst in this bromination reaction. The electrostatic and polarization effects are significantly influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the substitution groups on the catalysts. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of ChB bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the designation of more efficient chalcogen bond catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Development of general and simple designs of catalytic electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical.&#160; The present work demonstrates the multiple roles played by a hydrogel polymer in the fabrication and activity enhancement of the nanoelectrocatalyst.&#160; A nanocomposite thin film of Pd with the insulating hydrogel, poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), is fabricated through a facile in situ process, the polymer itself functioning as the reducing/stabilizing agent in the formation of Pd nanoparticles.&#160; Pd&#8208;PHEMA on Ni foam enables efficient HER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential; the polymer enables the electrocatalysis by its swelling and confinement of the electrolyte.&#160; Most significantly, when the electrode is subjected to an optimized cycling protocol, the overpotential decreases steadily, reaching an impressively low value of 36 mV (@10 mA cm&#8208;2).&#160; A low Tafel slope (68 mV dec&#8208;1), high exchange current density, Faradaic efficiency and TOF (3.27 mA cm&#8208;2, 99%, 122.7 h&#8208;1), and extended stability are achieved.&#160; Detailed investigations reveal the active role of the polymer in the evolution of the nanocatalyst, itself undergoing favorable morphological changes.&#160; The study illustrates the widened scope for developing efficient and stable catalytic electrodes with hydrogel polymers and unique features that promote the generation of green hydrogen.</dc:description>

Intersystem crossing: FRET (40.4&#8197;ps) and CS (1.55&#8197;ns) were observed, upper 3BDP* was populated by charge recombination, followed by the slow intramolecular TTET (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), which generates 3PBI* state, the triplet state formed via the RP ISC shows an unusual ESP phase pattern of (e, e, e, e, e, e), which is a rare example of S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing in the RP ISC mechanism.







Abstract
Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to study the spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=85&#8201;%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (&#934;&#916;=30&#8201;%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4&#8197;ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55&#8197;ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8&#8197;ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149&#8197;fs) and CS (4.7&#8197;ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8&#8197;ns and long&#8208;lived 3PBI* (179.8&#8197;&#956;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8722;T+1/T0 states mixing.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview is given on spatially resolved chiroptical spectroscopies, which represent a promising tool for mapping and disentangling local supramolecular structures in thin films of chiral organic dyes.







Abstract
Instrumental techniques able to identify and structurally characterize the aggregation states in thin films of chiral organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials, from the first&#8208;order supramolecular arrangement up to the microscopic and mesoscopic scale, are very helpful for clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships. Chiroptical imaging is currently gaining a central role, for its ability of mapping local supramolecular structures in thin films. The present review gives an overview of electronic circular dichroism imaging (ECDi), circularly polarized luminescence imaging (CPLi), and vibrational circular dichroism imaging (VCDi), with a focus on their applications on thin films of chiral organic dyes as case studies.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Pathway for Stereoselective Synthesis of (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;Enyne from &#946;&#8208;Nitroalkenes by Using a Sacrificial Directing Group</title>

         <dc:description>
Dancing hybridization: The first example of efficient and stereoselective (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates is described. Inauguration of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical triple bond by promoting zero&#8208;order to third&#8208;order upgradation make this methodology atom and step efficient with sustainability.







Abstract
The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereoselective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond with initial palladium&#8208;MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereoselective 1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Hybrids for Identifying a Novel Generation of Antagonists for the Smoothened Receptor in HH&#8208;Dependent Tumour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle is provided for the preparation of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei structurally similar to the active portion of known inhibitors of SMO, the main transducer of the HH pathway.







Abstract
Natural products (NPs) are highly profitable pharmacological tools due to their chemical diversity and ability to modulate biological systems. Accessing new chemical entities while retaining the biological relevance of natural chemotypes is a fundamental goal in the design of novel bioactive compounds. Notably, NPs have played a crucial role in understanding Hedgehog (HH) signalling and its pharmacological modulation in anticancer therapy. However, HH antagonists developed so far have shown several limitations, thus growing interest in the design of second&#8208;generation HH inhibitors. Through smart manipulation of the NPs core&#8208;scaffold, unprecedented and intriguing architectures have been achieved following different design strategies. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei that are structurally similar to the active portion of known SMO antagonists, the main transducer of the HH pathway. A thorough functional and biological investigation identified RH2_2 and RH2_6 rhein&#8208;based hybrids as valuable candidates for HH inhibition through SMO antagonism, with the consequent suppression of HH&#8208;dependent tumour growth. These findings also corroborated the successful application of the NPs&#8208;based hybrid design strategy in the development of novel NP&#8208;based SMO antagonists.

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;Driven Pore Functionalization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for metal&#8211;organic frameworks is presented. Diverse functional groups are installed within an analogue of MIL&#8208;53(Al) via disulfide bonds.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) imparts additional functionality to metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that is often difficult to access using solvothermal synthesis. As such, expanding the repertory of PSM reactions available to the practitioner is of increased importance for the generation of materials tailored for desired applications. Herein, a method is described for the protecting group&#8208;free installation of diverse functional groups within the pores of a MIL&#8208;53(Al) analogue via disulfide bond formation. The majority of the reactions proceed with thiol&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversions ranging from high to nearly quantitative. The disulfide bonds are stable in various solvents and can be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent.

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appropriate communication is the key to success: four new 1,8&#8208;napthalimide derivatives of acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type were obtained and thoroughly investigated, paying special attention to photophysical properties. The key element of the structures are the ethynyl linkers, thanks to which perfect &#960;&#8208;electron communication between aromaric building blocks is possible. These luminescence, highly efficient emitters were tested in SM&#8208;OLEDs&#8217; prototypes (DEV1&#8208;DEV4).







Abstract
Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820&#8197;cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.

Reactions of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) with carbon&#8208; and tin&#8208;based electrophiles led to the formation of novel [EPR]+ chains stabilized by two [CpMo(CO)2] units, which can formally be considered as heavier diazonium homologs. Reactivity studies on these unique entities with different NHCs showed the formation of novel, asymmetrically substituted diphosphenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) towards different group&#8197;14 electrophiles is reported. The resulting library of cationic compounds [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;EPR)]+ (R=Mes (2,4,6&#8208;C6H2Me3), CH3, CPh3, SnMe3) represents formally inorganic diazonium homologs which are stabilized by transition metal units. Modifying the steric and electronic properties of the electrophile drastically impacts the respective P&#8722;R bond lengths and is accompanied by increasing (SnMe3&gt;CPh3&gt;CH3) dynamic behavior in solution. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied organic analogs, the prepared compounds are stable at room temperature. The subsequent reaction of the model substrate [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P2Me)][OTf] ([OTf]&#8722;=[CF3SO3]&#8722;) with different N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) leads to an addition at the unsubstituted P atom which is also predicted by computational methods. NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation of two isomers sync/gauche&#8208;[{CpMo(CO)2}(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(NHC)PMe){CpMo(CO)2}][OTf]. X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization and additional DFT calculations shed light on the spatial arrangement as well as on the possible formation pathways of the isomers.

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylplatinum complex that shows polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence, as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization is reported. Simple mixing of this complex with a structurally similar arylplatinum complex in solution at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation); this allows their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned. Recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged by aryl groups resulting in a very short (3.0466(10) &#197;) Pt&#8722;Pt distance.







Abstract
A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in the transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned. We also found that recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged by aryl groups resulting in a very short (3.0466(10) &#197;) Pt&#8722;Pt distance.

         <title>Determination of the Handedness of Urea Inclusion Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To establish the correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute structure of urea inclusion compounds (UICs), three pairs of enantiomorphic UICs were studied. This successful experimental elucidation of the handedness of UICs not only settled a question that has lasted half a century, but also showcased the feasibility of absolute structure determination by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD).







Abstract
Since the discovery of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) in 1940, the handedness of this chiral helical system has not been established experimentally. Here three UIC systems containing only light atoms were studied. The optical rotations were first measured, and the absolute structures of the enantiomorphic domains of three UICs were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination by SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis: Tellurium, the Last Frontier?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is the non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between chalcogen atoms as Lewis acid sites and atoms or groups of atoms able to behave as Lewis bases through their lone pair or p electrons. Analogously to its sister halogen bonding, the high directionality of this interaction was implemented for the precise structural organization in the solid state and in solution. Regarding catalysis, ChB is now accepted as a new mode of activation as demonstrated by the increased number of examples in the last five years. In the family of ChB catalysts, those based on tellurium rapidly appeared to overcome their lighter sulfur and selenium counterparts. In this review, we highlight the Lewis acid properties of tellurium&#8208;based derivatives in solution and summarize the start&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of their applications in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Growth of Atomic Scale Seeds of Au Nanoparticle in the Nanospace of an Organic Cage Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seed&#8208;mediated growth has been widely used to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. Although it is becoming possible to directly observe the nucleation process of metal atoms at the single atom level by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is challenging to control the formation and growth of seeds with only a few metal atoms in homogeneous solution systems. Herein, we report site&#8208;selective formation and growth of atomic scale seeds of the Au nanoparticle in a nanospace of an organic cage molecule. We synthesized a cage molecule with amines and phenols, which were found to both capture and reduce Au(III) ions to spontaneously form the atomic scale seeds containing Au(0) in the nanospace. The growth reaction of the atomic scale seeds afforded Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.0 &#177; 0.2 nm, which is in good agreement with the inner diameter of the cage molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of NiI from NiII with H2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H2, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H2ase), which reacts with H2 to form various hydrogen active species such as NiIII hydride species, NiII hydride species, and NiI low&#8208;valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H2ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of NiI complex directly from H2 has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single&#8208;step synthesis of a NiI complex, via reaction of a NiII complex with H2, stable for over 3 months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization Study of a NODA Derivative&#160;Radiofluorination by Al18F Complexation Using a Design of Experiments Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) is the most favorable positron emitter for radiolabeling Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes. However, conventional 18F labeling through covalent C&#8208;F bond formation is challenging, involving multiple steps and stringent conditions unsuitable for sensitive biomolecular probes whose integrity may be altered. Over the past decade, an elegant new approach has been developed involving the coordination of an aluminum fluoride {Al18F} species in aqueous media at a late&#8208;stage of the synthetic process. The objective of this study was to implement this method and to optimize radiolabeling efficiency using a Design of Experiments (DoE). To assess the impact of various experimental parameters on {Al18F} incorporation, a pentadentate chelating agent NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was prepared as a model compound. This model carried a thiourea function present in the final conjugates resulting from the grafting of the chelating agent onto the probe. The formation of the radioactive complex Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was studied to achieve the highest radiochemical conversion. A complementary "cold" series study using the natural isotope 19F was also conducted to guide the radiochemical operating conditions. Ultimately, Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was obtained with a reproducible and satisfactory radiochemical conversion of 79 &#177; 3.5% (n = 5).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Bioluminescence of &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;Shaped Firefly Luciferin Analogues Based on A Novel Benzobisthiazole Core.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of p&#8208;extended conjugation &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped red shifted bioluminescent D&#8208;luciferin analogues based on a novel benzobisthiazole core is described. The divergent synthetic route allowed access to a range of amine donor substituents through an SNAr reaction. In spectroscopic studies, the &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins exhibited narrower optical band gaps, more red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra than D&#8208;luciferin. Their bioluminescence characteristics were recorded against four different luciferases (PpyLuc, FlucRed, CBR2 and PLR3). With native luciferase PpyLuc, the &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins demonstrated more red&#8208;shifted emissions than D&#8208;luciferin (&#955;bl = 561 nm) by 60 to 80 nm. In addition, the benzobisthiazole luciferins showed a wide range of bioluminescence spectra from the visible light region (&#955;bl = 500 nm) to the nIR window (&gt; 650 nm). The computational results validate the design concept which can be used as a guide for further novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon other &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped heterocyclic cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Brominated BODIPY Crystals: a Crystallographic and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of halogen bonds (XBs) has been a subject of great interest in recent years due to its clear application in catalysis, liquid crystals, and crystal engineering. In this study we analyzed the intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds in BODIPYs with increasing number of bromine atoms. The computational study included analyses through three different methods: the first approach of close contacts provided by Mercury, then the expanded approach of the electron density partition of the molecules in the crystals provided by the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces, and finally, the approach of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QT&#8208;AIM) to characterize the non&#8208;covalent interactions through finding electron density critical points between atoms and between neighboring molecules. The use of different computational methods allowed to gain insight on the interactions directing the crystal packing as the number of bromine atoms increase in the BODIPY moiety. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds involving halide/halide were found. The penta&#8208;brominated BODIPY showed four&#8208;center cyclic nodes where each node is linked via XBs. This kind of motifs can be useful in supramolecular chemistry and self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the investigation of the binary system Be&#8211;Ru two new phases &#8208; Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 &#8208; with similar compositions (63.6 at. % Be and 63.2 at. % Be, respectively), are discovered. They both represent new structural prototypes. The phases are located between Be2Ru (Fe2P&#8208;type structure) and Be3Ru2 (U3Si2&#8208;type structure) in the phase diagram. This explains why their crystal structures, solved and refined from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data, are described as 2D intergrowth of Fe2P and U3Si2 motives. The calculated electronic density of stats (DOS) reveals pronounced minima in the vicinity of the Fermi level for both compounds. Position&#8208;space analysis of chemical bonding exhibits the formation of three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic polar bonds, involving both, Ru and Be, atoms, and a strong charge transfer from Be to the more electronegative Ru.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) are attractive components to attain nanocomposites, yet their hydrophobic nature and strong tendency to aggregate often limit their use in aqueous conditions and negatively impact their properties.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) are attractive components to attain nanocomposites, yet their hydrophobic nature and strong tendency to aggregate often limit their use in aqueous conditions and negatively impact their properties.

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Cyclic [3]Spirobifluorenylene Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends (1) was designed and synthesized to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The three bifluorenyl units in 1 are conjugated to each other via spiro&#8208;conjugation, resulting in the splitting of the HOMO levels to a small extent. Therefore, the SOMO&#8211;HOMO gap of the radical cation species is small, which is considered to allow the facile intramolecular electron transfer. In the TD&#8208;DFT calculations for the radical cation species of 1, the geometry&#8208;featured interchain electronic transitions were visualized by NTO calculations. The radical cation species of 1 generated by chemical oxidation with SbCl5 exhibited a broadened and lower&#8208;energy shifted NIR absorption band compared to those of its partial structures. Considering the results of the TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the NIR band of the radical cation of 1 was attributed to the intramolecular electron transfer processes among the bifluorenyl units in the macrocycle. ESR experiments also indicated the delocalization of a spin of 1&#183;+ in the whole molecule via hole hopping in the ESR time scale at room temperature. This work demonstrates the usefulness of spiro&#8208;conjugation as a bridging unit in molecular wires to facilitate smooth electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here a synthetic strategy to prepare two distinct trimers of antiferromagnetically coupled {Cr7Ni} rings, substantially varying the magnetic interactions between the spin centres. The interactions were studied using multi&#8208;frequency cw EPR: in a trimer linked via non&#8208;covalent H&#8208;bonding interactions no measurable interaction between rings was seen, while in a trimer linked via iso&#8208;nicotinate groups isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of +0.42 and &#8208;0.8 GHz, respectively, were observed. The latter are the same as those for a simpler hetero&#8208;dimer system, showing how the spin&#8208;spin interactions can be built in a predictable and modular manner in these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;degradable Crosslinker for the Development of Light&#8208;responsive Protocell Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocleavable, poly(ethylene) glycol&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive to biological nucleophiles is synthesized and used to covalently stabilise proteinosome membranes. The crosslinker effectively degrades on irradiation with UV light, allowing for the photopatterning of populations of proteinosomes using a 405&#8197;nm laser, and for the controlled formation of membrane pores and the consequent controlled release of macromolecular cargoes based on their molecular weight.







Abstract
The achievement of light&#8208;responsive behaviours is an important target for protocell engineering to allow control of fundamental protocellular processes such as communication via diffusible chemical signals, shape changes or even motility at the flick of a switch. As a step towards this ambitious goal, here we describe the synthesis of a novel poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive towards nucleophiles, that effectively degrades with UV light (405&#8197;nm). We demonstrate its utility for the fabrication of the first protocell membranes capable of light&#8208;induced disassembly, for the photo&#8208;generation of patterns of protocells, and for the modulation of protocell membrane permeability. Overall, our results not only open up new avenues towards the engineering of spatially organised, communicating networks of protocells, and of micro&#8208;compartmentalised systems for information storage and release, but also have important implications for other research fields such as drug delivery and soft materials chemistry.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770&#8197;nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>

A novel class of Ruthenium(II) complexes that can be photoactivated at 770&#8197;nm under hypoxic conditions thanks to the incorporation of a heptamethine cyanine dye is described.







Abstract
Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770&#8197;nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2&#8201;% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770&#8197;nm), owing to a combination of type I and II PDT mechanisms. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.

&lt;p&gt;Light-activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)-activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl-based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770&#8197;nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (&lt;b&gt;Ru-Cyn-1&lt;/b&gt;), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low-oxygen concentration (2&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770&#8197;nm), owing to a combination of type I and II PDT mechanisms. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5-ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions &lt;b&gt;Ru-Cyn-1&lt;/b&gt; complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep-seated hypoxic tumours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging the Gap between Zeolites and Dense Silica Polymorphs: Formation of All&#8208;Silica Zeolite with High Framework Density from Natural Layered Silicate Magadiite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Between zeolite and silica: A silica zeolite RWZ&#8208;1 with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized through topotactic condensation of natural layered silicate magadiite. Based on the viewpoint of its FD and thermal expansion behavior, RWZ&#8208;1 is regarded as a truly intermediate silica material between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs, which can be applicable as a unique catalyst and adsorbent.







Abstract
A silica zeolite (RWZ&#8208;1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two&#8208;step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel&#8208;like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000&#8197;&#197;3. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;&#8208;quartz (26.5)). RWZ&#8208;1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high&#8208;density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer&#8208;like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stabilities.

         <title>Visible Light and Triselenium Dicyanide (TSD): New Horizons in the Synthesis of Organic Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates is to simply react triselenium dicyanide and styrenes (or alkenes) under blue light irradiation and O2. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates were explored as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent process to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were investigated for their photophysical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se&#8208;centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;&#8208;bond. &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes, respectively. It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates could be used as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent reaction strategy to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were evaluated for their photophysical properties. Overall, this new method provides a useful tool for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates, and demonstrates their potential for use in the synthesis of other compounds, thus giving new synthetic opportunities to construct organic selenocyanate compounds.

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) derived from an octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex and exploited for Suzuki coupling reactions. The high specific activity of the catalyst allowed to complete the coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions.







Abstract
The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1&#8197;nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Aminocarbonylation with Isocyanates Through Weak Coordinating Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild conditions: A redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation is developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation. The mild conditions allowed the introduction of privileged amide moieties to a wide range of anilides bearing various substitution patterns and different weakly Lewis basic directing groups.







Abstract
Introducing amide functional groups under mild conditions has growing importance owing to the prevalence of such moiety in biologically active molecules. Herein, we disclose a mild protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation with isocyanates as the amidating agents developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free reaction is guided by weakly Lewis basic functional groups, including anilides, lactams and carbamates to access anthranilamide derivatives. The synthetic utility of this transformation is reflected by large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct arylation reactions&lt;/b&gt; are widely used for the preparation of conjugated organic materials. The artwork, designed by Dr. Elena Mena-Osteritz, shows the structures of molecules, which were synthesized by regioselective C&#8722;H-activated direct arylations of dithienopyrroles with anthracenes, resembling a peace dove. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. B&#228;uerle and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202301867"&gt;10.1002/chem.202301867&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Intermediates in the Bypass Mechanism of Glutathione Peroxidase: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Structures of Selenocysteine&#8208;Derived Cyclic Selenenyl Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenocysteine (Sec)&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides, formed by the intramolecular cyclization of Sec selenenic acids (Sec&#8211;SeOHs), have been postulated to function as protective forms in the bypass mechanism of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, their chemical properties have not been experimentally elucidated in proteins or small&#8208;molecule systems. Recently, we reported the first nuclear magnetic resonance observation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs and their cyclization to the corresponding cyclic selenenyl amides using selenopeptide model systems incorporated in a molecular cradle. Herein, we elucidate the structures and reactivities of Sec&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides. The crystal structures and reactions toward a cysteine thiol or a 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;type chemical probe indicated the highly electrophilic character of cyclic selenenyl amides. This suggests that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the&#160;inactivation&#160;of Sec&#8211;SeOHs in GPx&#160;but also&#160;as highly electrophilic intermediates in the reactions of selenoproteins.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Chimeras as Electrochemical Biosensors for Host&#8208;Guest Measurements in Blood</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Few sensing platforms have become ubiquitous to enable rapid and convenient measurements at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. Those, however, are &#8220;one&#8208;off&#8221; technologies, meaning that they can only detect a single target and are hardly adaptable. In response, we plan to develop a sensing platform that can be extended to detect other classes of molecules and that affords rapid, convenient, continuous measurements directly in undiluted complex matrices. For this, we decided to rely on a host molecule that presents reversible interactions toward specific guest molecules to develop a new class of sensors that we coined &#8220;Electrochemical DNA&#8208;host chimeras&#8221;. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for our sensor, we decided to use cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (&#8220;blue box&#8221;) that we attached on an electrode&#8208;bound DNA to allow measurements of electron&#8208;rich guests such as dopamine and aspirin. Doing so allows to promote host&#8208;guest complex that could be quantified using blue box&#8217;s electrochemistry. Because of this unique sensor architecture, we achieve, to our knowledge, the first reagentless, continuous and rapid (&lt; 5 min) host&#8208;guest measurements in undiluted whole blood. We envision that given the library of electroactive host molecules that this will allow the development of a sensing platform for measurements of several classes of molecules in complex matrices at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a]Pyridine Carboxamide and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite remarkable successes in linear and branched vinyl (hetero) arene synthesis, regiodivergent C&#8208;H olefination with a single catalytic system has remained underdeveloped. Overcoming this limitation, herein, we report Pd/MPAA mediated regiodivergent olefination protocol of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamide and unactivated alkenes to generate branched and linear olefinated products depending upon the electronic nature of alkenes. Moreover, this protocol can be applied for C&#8208;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O as deuterium source. Preliminary experimental studies combined with computational investigations (DFT studies) suggest that regiodivergent olefination can be controlled by olefin insertion and b&#8208;hydride elimination steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexanuclear Ln6L6&#160;Complex Formation by using an Unsymmetric Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinuclear, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes present clear opportunities as sensors and imaging agents. Despite the widely acknowledged potential of this class of supramolecule, synthetic and characterization challenges continue to limit systematic studies into their self&#8208;assembly restricting the number and variety of lanthanide architectures reported relative to their transition metal counterparts. Here we present the first study evaluating the effect of ligand backbone symmetry on multinuclear lanthanide complex self&#8208;assembly. Replacement of a symmetric ethylene linker with an unsymmetric amide at the centre of a homoditopic ligand governs formation of an unusual Ln6L6&#160;complex with coordinatively unsaturated metal centres. The choice of triflate as a counterion, and the effect of ionic radii are shown to be critical for formation of the Ln6L6&#160;complex. The atypical Ln6L6&#160;architecture is characterized using a combination of mass spectrometry, luminescence, DOSY NMR and EPR spectroscopy measurements. Luminescence experiments support clear differences between comparable Eu6L6&#160;and Eu2L3&#160;complexes, with relatively short luminescent lifetimes and low quantum yields observed for the Eu6L6&#160;structure indicative of non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Synthesis of the Gd6L6analogue allows three distinct Gd&#183;&#183;&#183;Gd distance measurements to be extracted using homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Modern potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membrane ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) have achieved new breakthroughs in sensitivity, selectivity, and stability and extended applications in environmental surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial analysis. Moreover, nonclassical potentiometry shows promise for many applications and opens up new opportunities for potentiometric biosensing. Here, we aim to provide a concept to summarize advances over the past decade in the development of potentiometric biosensors with polymeric membrane ISEs. This concept articulates sensing mechanisms based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques. In particular, we emphasize new trends in potentiometric biosensing based on attractive dynamic approaches. Representative examples are selected to illustrate key applications under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes. More importantly, fruitful information obtained from non&#8208;equilibrium measurements with dynamic responses can be useful for artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of ISEs with advanced AI techniques for effective data processing is also discussed. We hope that the concept will illustrate the great possibilities offered by non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques and AI in potentiometric biosensing and encourage further innovations in this exciting field.</dc:description>

         <title>Isocyanides as Catalytic Electron Acceptors in the Visible Light Promoted Oxidative Formation of Benzyl and Acyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic isocyanides are able to harvest visible light and promote the oxidative formation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations provide key data for mechanistic insights. Furthermore, a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds is reported.







Abstract
The recent disclosure of the ability of aromatic isocyanides to harvest visible light and act as single electron acceptors when reacting with tertiary aromatic amines has triggered a renewed interest in their application to the development of green photoredox catalytic methodologies. Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground&#8208;state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground&#8208; and the excited&#8208;state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provide key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide&#8208;based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry is demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.

Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;-oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV-visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground-state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground- and the excited-state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provide key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide-based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry is demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven, Non&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion of Silicon Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small silacycles were obtained by small molecule activation with a bromosilylene. The silacycles were treated with isonitriles to induce ring expansion reactions. The saturated rings showed two subsequent isomerisation reactions.







Abstract
Silacycles are ubiquitous building blocks. Small silacycles can typically be expanded catalytically. A silirane, silirene and phosphasilirene as well as a siletane and a silolene were prepared starting from the base&#8208;free bromosilylene [(dtbpCbz)SiBr] (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). As these heterocycles were derived from a dicoordinated silylene, they are susceptible to reactions with an external base. The three&#8208;membered silacycles readily undergo non&#8208;catalysed ring expansion reactions with isonitriles yielding the related four&#8208;membered silacycles. Surprisingly, the ring&#8208;expanded derivatives of the silirane undergo up to two further isomerisation reactions, first by enamine formation and then by another ring expansion. DFT computations were utilised to gauge the scope of this reactivity pattern. Three&#8208;membered silacycles should essentially universally undergo a ring expansion with isonitriles, while for four&#8208;membered silacycles, only very few instances are predicted to accommodate more challenging kinetic requirements of this ring expansion. Larger silacycles lack the ring strain energy required for this ring expansion reaction and are not expected to be expanded.

The dehydropolymerization of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 using bis(imino)pyridine rhodium pre&#8208;catalysis reveals the &#963;&#8208;amine&#8722;borane complexes, nanoparticle formation, and polyaminoboranes with low residual metal content that can be chemically repurposed to N,N,N&#8208;trimethylcyclotriborazane.







Abstract
The sigma amine&#8722;borane complexes [Rh(L1)(&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;H3B&#8901;NRH2)][OTf] (L1=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine, R=Me, Et, nPr) are described, alongside [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf]. Using R=Me as a pre&#8208;catalyst (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 gives [H2BNMeH]n selectively. Added NMeH2, or the direct use of [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf], is required for initiation of catalysis, which is suggested to operate through the formation of a neutral hydride complex, Rh(L1)H. The formation of small (1&#8211;5&#8197;nm) nanoparticles is observed at the end of catalysis, but studies are ambiguous as to whether the catalysis is solely nanoparticle promoted or if there is a molecular homogeneous component. [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf] is shown to operate at 0.025&#8197;mol&#8201;% loadings on a 2&#8197;g scale of H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMeH2 to give polyaminoborane [H2BNMeH]n [Mn=30,900&#8197;g/mol, &#208;=1.8] that can be purified to a low residual [Rh] (6&#8197;&#956;g/g). Addition of Na[N(SiMe3)2] to [H2BNMeH]n results in selective depolymerization to form the eee&#8208;isomer of N,N,N&#8208;trimethylcyclotriborazane [H2BNMeH]3: the chemical repurposing of a main&#8208;group polymer.

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99:1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesised from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalysed ring opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scaleable.</dc:description>

Magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the phenoxo&#8208;hydrazone scaffolded lanthanide dimers lead to first example of trityl&#8208;governed zero field Ln&#8208;SMMs







Abstract
The triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Trityl&#8208;appended mono&#8208; (HL1) and bis&#8208;compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1&#8211;4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1&#8211;6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1&#8211;4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotropic axes and corroborated magnetic relaxation mechanisms to be a combination of Raman and quantum tunnelling in zero dc field, the latter being cancelled in the optimum non&#8208;zero dc field. Our work represents the first study of magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the trityl Ln&#8208;SMMs, leading to generation of slowly relaxing zero&#8208;field dysprosium complexes within the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies.

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;Droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;Induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for labeling cells with microdroplet identifiers generated from a set of DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads is demonstrated. By employing a combinatorial approach, in which combinations of DNA barcodes from randomly encapsulated multiple DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads collectively serve as unique molecular identifiers, generating many unique identifiers becomes feasible. In microdroplets, DNA barcoding molecules released from microbeads tag cell membranes, which are then read by single&#8208;cell sequencing.







Abstract
A microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8211;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Herein, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serve as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community in silico in the single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and displaying 6 or 12&#8197;monofluorocyclooctyne units grafted onto their surface allowed the design of deoxynojirimycin clusters by copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry ligation. The dendrimers proved to be potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors and behave as pharmacological chaperones in Gaucher disease cells. These dendrimers functionalized by monofluorocyclooctynes units may find numerous applications to prepare multivalent objects for biological purposes.







Abstract
The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8208;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes whose inner surfaces were selectively oxidized work well as a nano&#8208;container for concentrated DNA molecules. The Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction is exerted between DNA phosphate groups and the carboxylate anions formed on the inner carbon surface and the interaction attracts DNA molecules to the inner space so as to make the total net charge of DNA equal to the charge of the carboxylate anions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35&#8197;nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.

A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported that is capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and a 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.







Abstract
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The physical&#8208;chemical characterization of both redox states in DMSO&#8208;d6/H2O evidenced that the 1H relaxometric and 19F&#8197;NMR properties are appropriate for differential redox MRI detection. The Mn(III)&#8208;F distance (dMn&#8722;F=9.7&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;), as assessed by DFT calculations, is well tailored to allow for adequate paramagnetic effect of Mn(III) on 19F T1 and T2 relaxation times. Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 has a reversible Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox potential of 0.574&#8197;V vs. NHE in deoxygenated aqueous HEPES/ THF solution. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly, but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. The broad 1H and 19F&#8197;NMR signals of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 disappear in the presence of 1&#8197;equivalent ascorbate replaced by a shifted and broadened 19F&#8197;NMR signal from Mn(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.

Addition of zinc hydride to the germanium(II) center results in zincagermanes with H&#8722;Zn&#8722;Ge&#8722;H core, which react with CO2 to give a digermylene and zinc formate.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (TMEDA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), zinc dihydride reacted with germanium(II) compounds (BDI&#8722;H)Ge (1) and [(BDI)Ge][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (3) (BDI&#8208;H = HC{(C=CH2)(CMe)(NAr)2}, BDI = [HC(CMeNAr)2]; Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) by formal insertion of the germanium(II) center into the Zn&#8722;H bond of polymeric [ZnH2]n to give neutral and cationic zincagermane with a H&#8722;Ge&#8208;Zn&#8722;H core [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (2) and [(BDI)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (4), respectively. Compound 2 eliminated [ZnH2] giving diamido germylene 1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Compound 2 and deuterated analogue 2&#8208;d2 exchanged with [ZnH2]n and [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA to give a mixture of 2 and 2&#8208;d2. Compounds 2 and 4 reacted with carbon dioxide (1&#8197;bar) at room temperature to form zincagermane diformate [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(OCHO)&#8208;(OCHO)Zn(tmeda)] (5) and formate bridged digermylene [({BDI}Ge)2(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)]+[B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (6) along with zinc formate [(tmeda)Zn(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)3Zn(tmeda)][B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (7), respectively. The hydridic nature of the Ge&#8722;H and Zn&#8722;H bonds in 2 and 4 was probed by reactions with Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acids.

High valent MnV=O at room temperature: This works highlights the identification and characterization of a transient MnV=O species with the help of an in&#8197;situ generated anionic moiety. The oxidative species are mapped to trigger intracellular redox modulation to prevent cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (mCPBA = m&#8208;Chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative MnV=O species at RT. The proposed MnV=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.

Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoactivation of Solid&#8208;State Fluorescence through Controllable Intermolecular [2+2] Photodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient photoactivation behavior of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence of a variety of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide derivatives luminogens is achieved based on a controllable self&#8208;assembly and efficient intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction, which provides a simple and effective pathway to construct smart photoresponsive materials and fresh AIEgens with excellent photostability in purely through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
Intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization provides a distinctive approach to construct photoresponsive fluorescent materials in a manner of switching on solid&#8208;state fluorescence. Herein, we report efficient photoactivation of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence based on controllable intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide (BTO) derivatives, which provides a simple and effective way to construct smart photoresponsive solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials. Rational choice of substituents in BTO molecular skeleton enables them to efficiently undergo photodimerization through regulating molecular stacking in crystal, and also leads to photoactivation of solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to the generation of brightly fluorescent photodimers. This intermolecular photodimerization reaction also offers an effective method to synthesize photostable AIEgens with purely through&#8208;space conjugation.

         <title>Superhydrophilic and Superaerophobic Ru&#8208;Loaded NiCo Bimetallic Hydroxide Achieves Efficient Hydrogen Evolution over All pH Ranges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile and effective strategy to synthesize Ru NPs anchored on NiCo&#8208;BH by spontaneous redox reactions as high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalysts at all pH values. The Ru&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) interfacial bond between Ru nanoparticles and Ni&#8722;Co is beneficial to mass transfer in HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68 and 80&#8197;mV, a 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively.







Abstract
Realizing an effective, binder&#8208;free, and super&#8208;wetting electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at full pH is essential for the creation of clean hydrogen. In this study, the Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide (Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH) catalyst was prepared by spontaneous redox reaction. The chemical interaction between Ru NPs and NiCo&#8208;BH by the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) interface bond, the electron&#8208;rich Ru active site, and the multi&#8208;channel nickel foam carrier make the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface advantageous for mass transfer in the HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68 and 80&#8197;mV, a 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes respectively. This work provides a reference for the rational development of universal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in the all pH ranges through simple design strategies.

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Excitation Induced Electron Transfer in Bis Donor&#8208;AzaBODIPY Push&#8208;Pull Systems; Role of Nitrogenous Donors in Promoting Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor constructs featuring azaBODIPY and nitrogenous donors have been newly designed, synthesized and characterized using a range of physico&#8208;chemical techniques. Excited state charge transfer and separation, as a function of solvent polarity, is demonstrated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
A far&#8208;red absorbing sensitizer, BF2&#8208;chelated azadipyrromethane (azaBODIPY) has been employed as an electron acceptor to synthesize a series of push&#8208;pull systems linked with different nitrogenous electron donors, viz., N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NND), triphenylamine (TPA), and phenothiazine (PTZ) via an acetylene linker. The structural integrity of the newly synthesized push&#8208;pull systems was established by spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and DFT computational methods. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry studies revealed different redox states and helped in the estimation of the energies of the charge&#8208;separated states. Further, spectroelectrochemical studies performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell revealed diagnostic peaks of azaBODIPY&#8901;&#8722; in the visible and near&#8208;IR regions. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed the charge separation from one of the covalently linked donors to the 1azaBODIPY* to yield Donor&#8901;+&#8208;azaBODIPY&#8901;&#8722; to be energetically favorable in a polar solvent, benzonitrile, and the frontier orbitals generated on the optimized structures helped in assessing such a conclusion. Consequently, the steady&#8208;state emission studies revealed quenching of the azaBODIPY fluorescence in all of the investigated push&#8208;pull systems in benzonitrile and to a lesser extent in mildly polar dichlorobenzene, and nonpolar toluene. The femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies revealed the occurrence of excited charge transfer (CT) in nonpolar toluene while a complete charge separation (CS) for all three push&#8208;pull systems in polar benzonitrile. The CT/CS products populated the low&#8208;lying 3azaBODIPY* prior to returning to the ground state. Global target (GloTarAn) analysis of the transient data revealed the lifetime of the final charge&#8208;separated states (CSS) to be 195&#8197;ps for NND&#8208;derived, 50&#8197;ps for TPA&#8208;derived, and 85&#8197;ps for PTZ&#8208;derived push&#8208;pull systems in benzonitrile.

         <title>Diastereoselective Petasis&#8208;Borono&#8208;Mannich Crotylation Reactions of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Heteroatom (F, OBz, OH) Aldehydes: Rapid Access to Valuable Mono and Bicyclic Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>
The scope of the Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich reaction has been expanded to include crotylboronates as a variation of boronic ester. These have been examined in reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;heteroatom (F, OBz, OH) aldehydes and primary amines, to produce enantioenriched compounds up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 er. Examples have been converted to heterocyclic scaffolds with proof of absolute configuration.







Abstract
The crotylation reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;F, &#945;&#8208;OBz and &#945;&#8208;OH aldehydes under Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich conditions using (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;crotylboronates and primary amines resulted in &#947;&#8208;addition products in high dr and high er. &#945;&#8208;F and &#945;&#8208;OBz aldehydes gave 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn and 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;anti, products, respectively while an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde gave 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn products. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions of the former aldehydes can be explained using a six&#8208;membered ring transition state (TS) model in which a Cornforth&#8208;like conformation around the imine intermediate is favoured resulting in 1,2&#8208;anti products. The 2,3&#8208;stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open&#8208;TS involving H&#8208;bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;&#8208;OH group and the imine N atom. Representative products were converted to highly functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridines and 3H&#8208;oxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;ones which will be valuable scaffolds in synthesis.

The 2,3-stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;-OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open-TS involving H-bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;-OH group and the imine N atom.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of ABCD&#8208;Porphyrin Platinum(II) Complexes via Dehydrative Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes synthesis of ABCD&#8208;porphryin Pt(II) complexes via dehydrative aromatization in one&#8208;pot from corresponding dipyrrinatoPt(II) complexes and bisformyldipyrrins. This procedure also enables the construction of a C1&#8208;symmetrical ABCD&#8208;porphyrin with intrinsic chirality from achiral precursors. The photophysical properties of obtained molecules are also described in detail.







Abstract
Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization. Herein, we present a synthetic method to produce ABCD&#8208;porphyrins, including chiral ones, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving &#8220;coordination, cyclization, and dehydrative aromatization&#8221; using a mono&#8208;dipyrrinatoPt(II)Cl(COE) (COE=cyclooctene) complex as a platinum template.

Functionalized triose&#8208;, furanose and chromane&#8208;derivatives were synthesized by the titled reactions. The C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming cascade processes generate a functionalized sugar derivative with a quaternary stereocenter in a highly enantioselective fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) by using a simple combination of metal and chiral amine co&#8208;catalysts. Notably, the interplay between the chiral sugar substrate and the chiral amino acid derivative allowed for the construction of a functionalized sugar product with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) also when using a combination of racemic amine catalyst (0&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and metal catalyst.

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular copolymerization of chiral comonomers into helical assemblies can introduce competing polymerization pathways. Temperature can be used to control the composition of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based copolymers and thereby invert the helical screw&#8208;sense of the assemblies. By combining spectroscopy with computations, the authors show that the temperature&#8208;dependent helical structure originates from the copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.

The harmful effects of excess nitric oxide (NO) can be prevented by its scavenging. We show that a urea&#8208;functionalized molecule (Urea&#8208;eTCBD), rapidly binds to NO and forms a stable NONOate. The inhibition of NO&#8208;mediated, paw inflammation and corneal neovascularization by Urea&#8208;eTCBD, confirmed the biocompatibility and efficacy of the molecule. Additionally, Urea&#8208;eTCBD exhibited its potential for NO&#8208;sensing through a fluorescence turn&#8208;off mechanism.







Abstract
The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) were developed as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in&#8197;vitro, as a NO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.

         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Selective rearrangement reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides were efficiently promoted by silver catalysts under mild reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds by an intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides afforded the corresponding p&#8208;sulfenylanilides in good to high yields with good para selectivity. The transformation has a high compatibility of functional groups, such as ester, bromo, and iodo groups. Mechanistic studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction proceeds through intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;to&#8208;air, room&#8208;temperature RAFT polymerization procedure is employed in an automated platform to produce unprecedented complex macromolecular structures unobtainable manually. The precise structures made using this machine pave the way for the next generation of material design, harnessing large databases accessible using such automated material manufacturing.







Abstract
Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. This work combines an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. The highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system is reported, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cards for improvement. Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were synthesized and found to display improved reactivity compared to the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. The stability and catalytic performance were generally improved by deuteration, though the improvement was structure dependent. In particular, an unexpectedly large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated catalyst.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cards for improvement&lt;/b&gt;. Site-specifically deuterated organocatalysts were synthesized and found to display improved reactivity compared to the non-deuterated analogs. The stability and catalytic performance were generally improved by deuteration, though the improvement was structure dependent. In particular, an unexpectedly large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non-deuterated analogs. Two privileged &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric chiral binaphthyl-modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase-transfer catalysts was generally improved by site-specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase-transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non-deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Incorporating deuteriums into the correct positions of organocatalysts increases their stability and robustness, just like the story of &#8220;The Three Little Pigs&#8221;: the first two pigs hastily construct houses made of straw and sticks (non&#8208;deuterated and dideuterated catalysts), but they were quickly destroyed by the wolf&#8242;s huffing and puffing (OH&#8722;). In contrast, the third pig took time to build a sturdy house made of bricks (tetradeuterated catalyst), and the brick house remained intact. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Liu, H.&#8197;Naka, K.&#8197;Maruoka and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301866).

Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) can be prepared by a CVD technique using the straight and uniform nanochannels of an anodic aluminium oxide film as a template (top left). The CNTTs are readily dispersed in water. Importantly, a significant number of DNA molecules are specifically attracted to the inner space of CNTTs (bottom left). This is due to the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA and the inner carbon surface. The numerous small yellow spheres in the cover represent Ca2+ cations. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Kyotani, T. Itoh, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301422).

         <title>Quantifying Catalysis at the Origin of Life
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 53, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origin of life theories often invoke catalytic mechanisms, but catalysis of biologically relevant reactions in geologically plausible scenarios has been until recently experimentally elusive. In this perspective, we suggest that researchers move toward decreased catalyst loading, increased yields, as well as before/after characterization of metals or minerals to demonstrate true catalysis.







Abstract
The construction of hypothetical environments to produce organic molecules such as metabolic intermediates or amino acids is the subject of ongoing research into the emergence of life. Experiments specifically focused on an anabolic approach typically rely on a mineral catalyst to facilitate the supply of organics that may have produced prebiotic building blocks for life. Alternatively to a true catalytic system, a mineral could be sacrificially oxidized in the production of organics, necessitating the emergent &#8216;life&#8217; to turn to virgin materials for each iteration of metabolic processes. The aim of this perspective is to view the current &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; literature through the lens of materials chemistry to evaluate the need for higher catalytic activity and materials analyses. While many elegant studies have detailed the production of chemical building blocks under geologically plausible and biologically relevant conditions, few appear to do so with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metals or minerals. Moving toward sub&#8208;stoichiometric metals with rigorous materials analyses is necessary to demonstrate the viability of an elusive cornerstone of the &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; hypotheses: catalysis. We emphasize that future work should aim to demonstrate decreased catalyst loading, increased productivity, and/or rigorous materials analyses for evidence of true catalysis.

Graphdiyne, as a novel type of carbon allostrope, possessing both a planar conjugated structure and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. This review summarized various synthesis and modification methods of the GDY&#8208;based materials and their recent advances in energy storage are reviewed, including applications mainly in Li&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices, and the perspectives of the challenges and opportunities faced by GDY&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Graphynes (GYs) are a novel type of carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, boasting both a planar conjugated structure akin to graphene and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. Graphdiyne (GDY), the first successfully synthesized member of GYs family, has gained much interest due to its fascinating electrochemical properties including a greater theoretical capacity, high charge mobility and advanced electronic transport properties, making it a promising material for energy storage applications for lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage. Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large&#8208;scale commercial application of GDY&#8208;based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.

Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium-ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large-scale commercial application of GDY-based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium-ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cryogenic Ion Fluorescence Spectroscopy: FRET in Rhodamine Homodimers and Heterodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase FRET going cold: Photoexcitation of a rhodamine dye (the donor) in a homo&#8208; or heterodimer composed of two dyes separated by a short alkyl spacer leads to resonant energy transfer (RET) from the donor to the acceptor dye that has a lower excited&#8208;state energy. To selective excite one dye in a homodimer of two chemically identical dyes, experiments were done at cryogenic temperatures to resolve individual absorption bands.







Abstract
The internal electronic communication between two or more light&#8208;absorbers is fundamental for energy&#8208;transport processes, a field of large current interest. Here the intrinsic photophysics of homo&#8208; and heterodimers of rhodamine cations were studied where just two methylene units bridge the dyes. Gas&#8208;phase experiments were done on frozen molecular ions at cryogenic temperatures using the newly built LUNA2 mass spectroscopy setup in Aarhus. Both absorption (from fluorescence excitation) and dispersed&#8208;fluorescence spectra were measured. In the gas phase, there is no dielectric screening from solvent molecules, and the effect of charges on transition energies is maximum. Indeed, bands are redshifted compared to those of monomer dyes due to the electric field that each dye senses from the other in a dimer. Importantly, also, as two chemically identical dyes in a homodimer do not experience the same field along the long axis, each dye has separate absorption. At low temperatures, it is therefore possible to selectively excite one dye. Fluorescence is dominantly from the dye with the lowest transition energy no matter which dye is photoexcited. Hence this work unequivocally demonstrates F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer even in homodimers where one dye acts as donor and the other as acceptor.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Supramolecular 1D Alternating Copolymer in Crystal toward 2D Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D non&#8208;covalent supramolecular copolymer is aligned horizontally with the 2D crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported 2D platelet crystal waveguides.







Abstract
To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one&#8208;dimensional&#8208;ordered supramolecular structures composed of light&#8208;emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, a bipyridyl&#8208;appended acrylonitrile&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule was designed, which produced a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer constructed through non&#8208;covalent bonding between a lone pair in bipyridyl and a &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The one&#8208;dimensional copolymer of bipyridyl and 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene is aligned horizontally with the two&#8208;dimensional crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non&#8208;covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the two&#8208;dimensional surface. Compared with the loss coefficient &#945;L=52&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the long&#8208;axis direction of the two&#8208;dimensional platelet cocrystal, a very large difference of &#945;S=2111&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is present in the crystal short&#8208;axis direction. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported two&#8208;dimensional platelet crystal waveguides. This supramolecular synthon provides an approach to designing anisotropic photon transporters and highly regulated optical logic circuits.

         <title>Single Molecular Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Binaphthol&#8208;Decorated Optically Innocent Cyclotriphosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design strategy based on the dendritic effect results in a single chiral chromophore that emits simultaneous persistent RTP and circularly polarized luminescence. This study suggests that the optical features of these compounds are dominated by the pendent BINOL entity without the participation of the cyclophosphazene dendritic core.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features of BINOL&#8208;decorated cyclotriphosphazenes (CPs) are reported for the first time. The luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of these compounds in chloroform solutions and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin films with wt 1&#8201;% doping concentrations are found to be 1.0&#215;10&#8722;3, and 2.9&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. However, no CPL signal is observed for the pristine solids. The enantiomers (CP&#8208;(R)/CP&#8208;(S)) show ultraviolet photoluminescence (~350&#8211;360&#8197;nm) in solution and the solid state. These compounds show ~10&#8197;times larger absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) than the simple BINOLs in the solutions state. In the solid state, CP&#8208;(R) shows larger PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(R); in contrast, the S enantiomer shows lower PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(S); this indicates that the isomer&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;state packing of these compounds plays a crucial role in controlling the PL. Thin films with more than 1&#8201;% doping concentration and pristine solids of these compounds do not show persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) due to concentration&#8208;caused quenching. However, thin films with wt 1&#8201;% of these chiral emitters exhibit pRTP characteristics with a ~159&#8208;343&#8197;ms lifetime under vacuum. Theoretical calculations reveal that the cyclophosphazene acts as an optically innocent dendritic core, and the optical features of these compounds are dictated by the pendent BINOL chromophore.

         <title>Protein Sequencing with Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Integrated Phosphorene Nanoslit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning integrated phosphorene nanoslit for high throughput protein sequencing based on the transverse tunneling current approach is presented herein. The findings reveal that materials with a puckered geometry outperform planar ones, offering exciting new possibilities for more accurate and efficient protein sequencing.







Abstract
Achieving high throughput protein sequencing at single molecule resolution remains a daunting challenge. Herein, relying on a solid&#8208;state 2D phosphorene nanoslit device, an extraordinary biosensor to rapidly identify the key signatures of all twenty amino acids using an interpretable machine learning (ML) model is reported. The XGBoost regression algorithm allows the determination of the transmission function of all twenty amino acids with high accuracy. The resultant ML and DFT studies reveal that it is possible to identify individual amino acids through transmission and current signals readouts with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, we thoroughly compared our results to those from graphene nanoslit and found that the phosphorene nanoslit device can be an ideal candidate for protein sequencing up to a 20&#8208;fold increase in transmission sensitivity. The present study facilitates high throughput screening of all twenty amino acids and can be further extended to other biomolecules for disease diagnosis and therapeutic decision making.

         <title>Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual nickel and photoredox catalysis enables the semi&#8208;reduction of internal aryl alkynes in the presence of a trialkylamine acting both as a reductive quencher and as a transfer hydrogenation reagent. The E/Z&#8208;stereoselectivity can be controlled with the aid of an alcohol additive.







Abstract
We report a selectivity&#8208;switchable nickel hydride&#8208;catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi&#8208;reduction of internal alkynes to E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo&#8208;induced generation of nickel hydride, syn&#8208;hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post&#8208;reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions. Instead, we demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the reaction is dependent on the rate of a final protonolysis step which can be tuned by adjusting the pKa of an alcohol additive.

         <title>A Guanidine&#8208;Supported &#960;&#8208;Complex of Germanium Amenable to Intramolecular C&#8208;C Cleavage in Arene and Ge Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R = SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge (NHI= N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R= SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8208;Tol)Ge (R= p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge to 70 &#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8208;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8208;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8208;Tol)NGe]n.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Carbodicarbene Class by Embedding an Anionic Component in its Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbodicarbene (CDC) has become an emerging ligand in many fields due to their strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability. We report the synthesis of the first anionic CDC pincer Pd complexes containing a BF2 moiety within the framework, a charge&#8208;frustration zwitterion approach to leverage the electronic feature of carbon(0)/carbone, which is unprecedented. The elucidation of X&#8208;ray crystal structures, ligand competition as well as transmetallation experiments suggest that the anionic moiety has enhanced the overall donor strength of the traditional neutral CDC. Importantly, this anionic scaffold exhibits a facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance, whereas previously reported neutral pincer CDC complexes do not possess a two&#8208;fold donor capacity. The analysis of the bonding situation via theoretical methods shows that the description of the anionic CDC moieties in terms of dative bonding is preferred over the model of delocalized positive charge, as it accounts for the two&#8208;fold donor ability of the divalent carbon atom, preserving characteristic feature of a carbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Dimethyl Stellane&#8208;1,5&#8208;Dicarboxylate&#160;as a Key Precursor for the ortho&#8208;Benzene Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present previously unavailable C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds which have a potential to become valuable tools in medicinal chemistry and crop science as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids. We have developed a scalable protocol (up to 50 g from a single synthetic run) for the synthesis of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (bisnoradamantane or stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has revealed that this scaffold is an optimal saturated isostere for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene where substituents exhibit the in&#8208;plane topology. The synthetic protocol is based on the oxidative cyclization of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (DMOD) through lithiation followed by I2 oxidation. The reaction outcome is determined by the stereochemistry of the substrate. While the endo,endo cis&#8208;DMOD,&#160; exclusively gives the "unwanted" Claisen cyclization product the exo,endo cis&#8208; and exo,exo cis&#8208; stereoisomers afford the desired stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester quantitatively. DFT computations have revealed that the reaction proceeds via the dianion of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, which undergoes SET oxidation by I2 to form a radical anion. The subsequent cyclization followed by a second SET oxidation gives desired stellane derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Methoxylation Promoted CPET Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manuscript discloses a methoxylation reaction to an aromatic carbonyl function that carries out a CPET reaction oxidizing a transition metal ion. Spontaneous methoxylation of a redox non&#8208;innocent fragment coordinated to a high spin cobalt(II) ion, promoted concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction oxidizing cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) in air and subsequent demethoxylation induced reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II) producing H2O2 are authenticated. The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is &#8208;0.27 V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple. However, in presence of MeOH the reduction potential decreases to &#8208;1.02 V due to CPET involving MeOH proton. In CH2Cl2/CHCl3 spontaneous demethoxylation occurs giving back the original complex and reactive methoxyl radical that reacts with O2 producing H2O2. Overall one molecule of MeOH produces one molecule of H2O2. To analyze the involvement of the proton, the rate constants of the CPET reactions in CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (2:1) and CH2Cl2&#8208;CD3OD (2:1) and the demethoxylation reaction in CHCl3 at 330 K were determined by time drive UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium and Iron Co&#8208;doped Molybdenum Carbide as a Stable Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Harsh Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most commercially valuable pathways of hydrogen production especially combined with renewable electricity; however, efficient and durable electrocatalysts are urgently needed to reduce electric energy consumption. Here, we reported a Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C on nitrogen doped carbon via a controllable two&#8208;step method, which can be used for efficient and enduring hydrogen evolution reaction. At 10, 100 and 200 mA cm&#8208;2 in acidic electrolyte, the resultant Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC delivered low overpotentials of 31, 78 and 103 mV, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). At an applied current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, stable hydrogen production was conducted for 120 h without obvious degradation. In alkaline media, Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC can also deliver a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 for more than 100 h. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC electrocatalyst was used as cathode in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer under industrial environments for robust hydrogen production. The characterization and electrochemical results prove the synergism effects between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C for promoting hydrogen evolution activity. This work would pave a new avenue to fabricate low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for industrial water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Germylenes Exhibiting Solid&#8208;State Emissions that Extend to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state photoluminescence of low&#8208;valent main group element compounds is investigated for the first time using stable germylene carboxylates. Apart from showing room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence, these carboxylates exhibited significant differences in their solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state emissions.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group compounds that fluoresce in the solid&#8208;state were previously unknown. To address this, we investigated room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence from a series of crystals of germylenes 3&#8211;8 in this article; they exhibited emissions nearly reaching the NIR. Germylene carboxylates (3&#8211;8) were synthesized by reacting dipyrromethene stabilized germylene pyrrolide (2) with carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, p&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, and acetylsalicylic acid.

         <title>Elucidation of Substituent&#8208;Responsive Reactivities via Hierarchical and Asymmetric Assemblies in Crystalline p&#8208;Quinodimethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups in the crystals were elucidated by analyzing crystal structures through their hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, 1D&#8208;columns, 2D&#8208;sheets, and 3D&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals) and intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with DFT calculations.







Abstract
We propose a mechanism for substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups through their hierarchical and asymmetric assembly modes. Four asymmetric 7,8,8&#8208;tris(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes with a 7&#8208;positioned ethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;a(H)), 2&#8217;&#8208;fluoroethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;b(F)), 2&#8217;&#8208;chloroethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;c(Cl)), or 2&#8217;&#8208;bromoethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;d(Br)) were synthesized and crystallized. 2&#8201;a(H), 2&#8201;b(F) and 2&#8201;d(Br) afforded only one shape crystal, while 2&#8201;c(Cl) did two polymorphic 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#945; and 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#946;. UV&#8208;irradiation induced topochemical polymerization for 2&#8201;a(H), no reactions for 2&#8201;b(F) and 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#945;, and [6+6] photocycloaddition dimerization for 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#946; and 2&#8201;d(Br). Such substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities and crystal structures were compared with those of the known symmetric 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes such as 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;a(Me)&#8208;&#945; and 1&#8201;a(Me)&#8208;&#946;), 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;b(Et)), and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(bromoethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;c(BrEt)). The comparative study clarified that the reactivities and crystal structures are classified into four types that link to each other. This linkage is understandable when we analyze the crystal structures through the following hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, one dimensional (1D)&#8208;columns, two dimensional (2D)&#8208;sheets, and three dimensional (3D)&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals). This supramolecular viewpoint is supported by intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Such research enables us to elucidate the substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of the crystals, and reminds us of the selection of the right path in a so&#8208;called &#8220;maze game&#8221;.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Aided NO2 Discrimination with an Array of Graphene Chemiresistors Covalently Functionalized by Diazonium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nosey, NO2sey! An e&#8208;nose based on graphene chemiresistors, covalently functionalized by exploiting diazonium chemistry, has been developed to detect and discriminate nitrogen dioxide for environmental and medical applications.







Abstract
Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystems, electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalized with one of three different aryl rings: 4&#8208;nitrophenyl, 4&#8208;carboxyphenyl and 4&#8208;bromophenyl. The distinct modified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e&#8208;nose for NO2 discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO2 was demonstrated through exposure to gaseous solutions with NO2 concentrations in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array was tested by carrying out exposure to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis showed that the e&#8208;nose can discriminate NO2 among all the interfering gases in a two&#8208;dimensional principal component analysis space.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nosey, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;sey&lt;/b&gt;! An e-nose based on graphene chemiresistors, covalently functionalized by exploiting diazonium chemistry, has been developed to detect and discriminate nitrogen dioxide for environmental and medical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystems, electronic noses (e-noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalized with one of three different aryl rings: 4-nitrophenyl, 4-carboxyphenyl and 4-bromophenyl. The distinct modified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e-nose for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was demonstrated through exposure to gaseous solutions with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array was tested by carrying out exposure to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis showed that the e-nose can discriminate NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; among all the interfering gases in a two-dimensional principal component analysis space. Finally, the e-nose was trained to accurately recognize NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributions with a linear discriminant analysis approach, thus providing a metric for discrimination assessment with a prediction accuracy above 95&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in RNA Labeling with Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic RNA with novel fluorine labeling patterns is presented. The study completes the set of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases and enables advanced NMR spectroscopic and cellular applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 group without any RNA sequence restrictions.







Abstract
Fluorine labeling of ribonucleic acids (RNA) in conjunction with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful strategy for spectroscopic analysis of RNA structure and dynamics, and RNA&#8208;ligand interactions. This study presents the first syntheses of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 guanosine and uridine phosphoramidites, their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides by solid&#8208;phase synthesis and a comprehensive study of their properties. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modification is associated with preferential C2&#8242;&#8208;endo conformation of the U and G ribose in single&#8208;stranded RNA. When paired to the complementary strand, slight destabilization of the duplex caused by the modification was revealed by UV melting curve analysis. Moreover, the power of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 label for NMR spectroscopy is demonstrated by dissecting RNA pseudoknot folding and its binding to a small molecule. Furthermore, the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modification has potential for applications in therapeutic oligonucleotides. To this end, three 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 modified siRNAs were tested in silencing of the BASP1 gene which indicated enhanced performance for one of them. Importantly, together with earlier work, the present study completes the set of 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases (A, U, C, G) and hence enables applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3 group without any restrictions in placing the modification into the RNA target sequence.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogs of Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of 17 diisopropyl &#945;&#8208;oxophosphonates was accomplished by using a commercially available Noyori&#8208;type catalyst. The highly enantioenriched products (ee &gt;98&#8201;% in all cases but one) were further converted to the phosphonic acid analogs of 15 aminocarboxylic acids. The established method can also be used for the asymmetric transfer deuteration (ATD) of the starting &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminophosphonic acids have a remarkably broad bioactivity spectrum. They can function as highly efficient transition state mimics for a variety of hydrolytic and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzymes, which makes them interesting target structures for synthetic chemists. In particular, the phosphonic acid analogs to &#945;&#8208;aminocarboxylic acids (PaAAs) are potent enzyme inhibitors, but many of them are only available by chiral or enzymatic resolution; sometimes only one enantiomer is accessible, and several have never been prepared in enantiopure form at all. Today, a variety of methods to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids is known but none of the reported approaches can be generally applied for the synthesis of PaAAs. Here we show that the phosphonic acid analogs of many (proteinogenic) &#945;&#8208;amino acids become accessible by the catalytic, stereoselective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates. The highly enantioenriched (enantiomeric excess (ee) &#8805; 98&#8201;%) &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates obtained are important pharmaceutical building blocks in themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogs became easily accessible from the same &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates using deuterated formic acid (DCO2H).

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was developed with group&#8197;13 elements, B, Al, and Ga. The ligand enabled the stabilization of geometrically strained boron cationic species.







Abstract
A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group&#8197;13 elements, B, Al, and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8722;B&#8722;C angle of 140&#176;. Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted LnDOTA Chelates from Achiral Starting Materials by Deracemization Under Mild Conditions
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;substituted DOTA chelates can be prepared from racemic and achiral starting materials. The mixture of stereoisomeric ligands produced deracemizes, under mild conditions, to a single diastereoisomeric chelate with the introduction of the metal ion.







Abstract
Substituted derivatives of the DOTA framework are of general interest to alter chelate properties and facilitate the conjugation of chelates to other molecular structures. However, the scope of substituents that can be introduced into the &#945;&#8208;position has traditionally been limited by the availability of a suitable enantiopure starting materials to facilitate a stereoselective synthesis. Tetra&#8208;substituted DOTA derivatives with phenyl and benzoate substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position have been prepared. Initial syntheses used enantiopure starting materials but did not afford enantiopure products. This indicates that the integrity of the stereocenters was not preserved during synthesis, despite the homo&#8208;chiral diastereoisomer being the major reaction product. The homochiral diastereoisomer could be produced as the major or sole reaction product when starting from racemic or even achiral materials. Deracemization was found to occur during chelation through the formation of an enolate stabilized by the aryl substituent. This general ability of aryl groups to enable deracemization greatly increases the range of substituents that can be introduced into DOTA&#8208;type ligands with diastereochemical selectivity.

Mixed&#8208;metal oxo&#8208;alkoxide clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (M=Co, Zn) containing a lacunary double cubane oxometallic core incorporating diethanolamine ligands in unusual bonding modes have been prepared and fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab initio computational methods, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis.







Abstract
Organofunctionalized tetranuclear clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (1, M=Co, 2: M=Zn) containing an unprecedented oxometallacyclic {M2V2Cl2N4O8} (M=Co, Zn) framework have been prepared by solvothermal reactions. The new oxo&#8208;alkoxide compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab initio computational methods, and complete single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis. The isostructural clusters are formed of edge&#8208;sharing octahedral {VO5N} and trigonal bipyramidal {MO3NCl} units. Diethanolamine ligates the bimetallic lacunary double cubane core of 1 and 2 in an unusual two&#8208;mode fashion, unobserved previously. In the crystalline state, the clusters of 1 and 2 are joined by hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional network structure. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate weakly antiferromagnetic interactions between the vanadium centers [Jiso(VIV&#8722;VIV)=&#8722;5.4(1); &#8722;3.9(2) cm&#8722;1], and inequivalent antiferromagnetic interactions between the cobalt and vanadium centers [Jiso (VIV&#8722;CoII)=&#8722;12.6 and &#8722;7.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1] contained in 1.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Injection in Graphene: An EPR and Raman Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin injection on graphene. Tyrosine radicals were covalently attached on graphene and graphene oxide. The tyrosine functionalized graphene products showed increased spin concentration, elevated aromaticity, and conductivity.







Abstract
In this article, the enrichment of graphene and graphene oxide with free radicals through their functionalization with tyrosine is studied. In contrast with what is commonly observed in the functionalization of graphene with organic species the addition of tyrosine radicals on to the graphene substrate led to a remarkable increase of the aromatic character as indicated by the spectroscopic data. Similar behaviour was observed for the functionalization of graphene oxide. In addition, a brief analysis of the tyrosine functionalized graphene with EPR spectroscopy showed a remarkable enhancement of the spin density that could be useful in spintronics.

         <title>Exploring the multifarious role of ligand in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus towards investigating the redox properties of ancillary ligand backbones for small molecule activation. Several metal complexes have been reported for electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER), providing valuable mechanistic insights. This process involves efficient coupling of electrons and protons. Redox&#8208;active ligands stipulate internal electron transfer and promote effective orbital overlap between metal and ligand, thereby enabling efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. Understanding such catalytic mechanisms requires thorough spectroscopic and computational analyses. Herein, we summarize recent examples of molecular electrocatalysts based on 3d transition metals that have significantly influenced mechanistic pathways, thus emphasizing the multifaceted role of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Group I Alkoxides and Amylates as Highly Efficient Silicon&#8211;Nitrogen Heterodehydrocoupling Precatalysts for the Synthesis of Aminosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group I alkoxides are highly active precatalysts in the heterodehydrocoupling of silanes and amines to afford aminosilane products. The broadly soluble and commercially available KOtAmyl was utilized as the benchmark precatalyst for this transformation. Challenging substrates such as anilines were found to readily couple primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes in high conversions (&gt; 90%) after only 2 h at 40 &#176;C. Traditionally challenging silanes such as Ph3SiH were also easily coupled to simple primary and secondary amines under mild conditions, with reactivity that rivals many rare earth and transition&#8208;metal catalysts for this transformation. Preliminary evidence suggests the formation of hypercoordinated intermediates, but radicals were detected under catalytic conditions, indicating a mechanism that is rare for Si&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Racemization Unraveled for MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 by means of a Computational Analysis of MoO2(acnac)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octahedral chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 (a&#8209;chel = asymmetric chelate) can rearrange their ligands by four mechanisms known as the Bailar (B), Ray&#8208;Dutt (RD), Conte&#8208;Hippler (CH), and Dhimba&#8208;Muller&#8208;Lammertsma (DML) twists. Racemization involves their interconnections, which were computed for MoO2(acnac)2 (acnac = &#946;&#8208;ketoiminate) using density functional theory at &#969;B97x&#8208;D with the 6&#8208;31G(d,p) and 6&#8208;311G(2d,p) basis sets and LANL2DZ for molybdenum. Racemizing the cis(NN) isomer, being the global energy minimum with trans oriented imine groups, is a three step process (DML&#8208;CH&#8208;DML) that requires 17.4 kcal/mol, while all three cis isomers (cis(NN), cis(NO), and cis(OO)) interconvert at &#8804; 17.9 kcal/mol. The B and RD twists are energetically not competitive and neither are the trans isomers. The interconnection of all enantiomeric minima and transition structures is summarized in a graph that also visualizes valley ridge inflection points for two of the three CH twists. Geometrical features of the minima and twists are given. Lastly, the influence of N&#8208;substitution on the favored racemization pathway is evaluated. The present comprehensive study serves as a template for designing chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 catalysts that may retain their chiral integrity.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide&#8208;Coupled Double Electron Transfer with Electron&#8208;Rich Diboranes</title>

         <dc:description>The ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(&#956;&#8208;hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidinate) acts as a stable surrogate of the elusive dication [B2(hpp)2]2+, being both electrophilic (vacant boron p orbitals) and nucleophilic (filled B&#8208;B bond orbital). This combination of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane chemistry, with Lewis &#963;&#8208;basic and &#960;&#8208;acidic substrates being bound and reduced at the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction type within this general theme, in which double electron transfer from the diboron unit to the boron&#8208;bound organic substrate is coupled with halide transfer in the other direction.

This combination of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane chemistry, with Lewis &#963;-basic and &#960;-acidic substrates being bound and reduced at the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction type within this general theme, in which double electron transfer from the diboron unit to the boron-bound organic substrate is coupled with halide transfer in the other direction. Novel diborylated dienamines are synthesized in this way. The scope of this unprecedented reaction motif and the reaction pathways are elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole) bearing branched flexible chains that stabilize a room&#8208;temperature columnar hexagonal phase is reported for the first time. With balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility, it has a high extinction coefficient, a small optical band gap and a wide absorption range.







Abstract
A new series of highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole)s bearing branched flexible chains stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase and with balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility is reported for the first time. Only the anti isomer was successfully separated and characterized. These compounds have a high extinction coefficient, small optical band gap and wide absorption range, thus making them a promising class of ambipolar organic semiconductors capable of self&#8208;organizing.

         <title>Chemical Tailoring of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Adsorption from Drinking Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by amino&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;CD) through different sized alkyl linkers (Cn) is presented. The adsorption properties of GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD materials toward perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS, is studied by combined experimental tests and molecular dynamic simulations allowing deep understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and the adsorption performance.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from drinking water. &#946;CD were functionalized with a pending amino group, and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#946;CD units in the range 12&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% was estimated by combined XPS and elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency, with the hexyl linker derivative GO&#8208;C6&#8208;&#946;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamic simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules retention.

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra by Using Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I)&#8208;catalysed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click chemistry is a versatile post&#8208;synthetic tool to functionalize the surface chemistry of alkyne&#8208;functionalized cuboctahedral Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs). This methodology enables quantitative functionalization of MOPs with a wide range of functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids and biomolecules.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. This study describes the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24 available surface alkyne groups was synthesised. Each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of the &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can react with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. The wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry was exploited to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great success of the concept of doping organic compounds with BN units to access new materials with tailored prop&#173;erties, its use in polymer chemistry has only been realized quite re&#173;cently. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of oligo&#8208; and poly&#173;(arylene iminoborane)s comprising a back&#173;bone of phenylene or thio&#173;phene moieties, as well as combinations thereof, linked via B=N units. The novel polymers can be regarded as BN analogues of poly&#173;(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) or poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) or their copolymers, respectively. Our modular syn&#173;thetic approach al&#173;lowed us to prepare four polymers and twelve monodisperse oligo&#173;mers with modulated electronic properties. Alter&#173;nating electron&#8208;re&#173;leasing di&#173;aminoarylene and electron&#8208;accepting dibo&#173;rylarylene building blocks give rise to a pronounced donor&#8211;acceptor character. Effective &#960;&#8208;con&#173;ju&#173;ga&#173;tion over the arylene iminoborane back&#173;bone is evidenced by sys&#173;tematic bathochromic shifts of the low&#8208;energy UV&#8208;vis absorp&#173;tion max&#173;imum with increasing chain length, which is furthermore sup&#173;ported by crystallographic and compu&#173;tational investigations. Further&#173;more, all compounds investigated show emission of visible light in the solid state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to the presence of partially flexible linear B=N linkages in the back&#173;bone.</dc:description>

         <title>An Investigation of Allyl&#8208;Substituted&#160;Bis(Diphosphine) Iron Complexes: Towards Precursors for Cooperative CO2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In developing homogenous catalysts capable of CO2&#160;activation, interaction with a metal center is often imperative. This work provides our primary efforts towards the cooperative activation of CO2&#160;using a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and iron via a paired theoretical/experimental approach. Specifically, we report efforts towards [Fe(diphosphine)2(N2)] as a CO2&#8208;coordinated synthon where diphosphine =&#160;1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;cyclohexylboraneyl)propylphosphino)ethane) (P2BCy4) or its precursor,&#160;tetrakisallyldiphosphinoethane (tape). Initial efforts toward the {Fe(0)&#8208;N2} complex were focused on deprotonation reactions of [Fe(diphosphine)2(H)(NCCH3)]+&#160;and reduction of [Fe(tape)2Cl2]. In the latter case, a mixture of intramolecularly p&#8208;bonded alkene and associated metallacyclic Fe(II)&#8212;H species were produced &#8211; heating this mixture provided the hydride as the major product. Notably, the interconversion of this pair counters that of related intermolecular reactions between [Fe(depe)2] (depe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) and ethylene, where hydride formation occurs subsequent to p&#8208;coordination; this has been probed by theoretical calculations. Finally, reactivity of the metallacyclic {Fe(II)&#8212;H} complex with CO2&#160;was probed, resulting in a pair of isomeric ferra(II)lactones.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Formation of Electroactive Graphene&#8208;Based Cementitious Composites: Towards Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of composites combining multiple components each one imparting a specific function to the ensemble is highly sought after for disruptive applications in chemistry and materials science, with a particular importance for the realization of smart structures. Here we report on the development of an unprecedented multifunctional cementitious composite incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO).&#160;By design, this material features enhanced electrical properties while retaining the excellent cement&#8217;s hydration and microstructure.The multiscale investigation on the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the dispersion allowed to establish an efficient preparation protocol for rGO aqueous dispersion as well as rGO&#8208;based cementitious composites using a commercial poly(carboxylate ether)&#8208;based superplasticizer. Conduction mechanisms within the matrix of rGO containing mortars were unraveled by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealing conductive paths originating from bulk cement matrix and rGO nanosheets in composites with rGO loadings as low as 0.075wt.%. For this rGO loading, we observed the reduction of the resistivity of bulk cement mortar layers from 18.3M&#937;&#160;cm to 2.8M&#937;&#160;cm. Moreover, the addition of 0.2wt.% of rGO resulted in the formation of rGO conductive paths with resistivity of 51.1k&#937;&#160;cm. These findings represent a major step forward towards the application of graphene in structural health monitoring of concrete structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Dyads and Triads of Boron Difluoride Formazanate and Boron Difluoride Dipyrromethene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dye&#8208;dye conjugates have attracted significant interest for their utility in applications such as bioimaging, theranostics, and light&#8208;harvesting. Many classes of organic dyes have been employed in this regard; however, building blocks don&#8217;t typically extend beyond small chromophores. This can lead to minor changes to the optoelectronic properties of the original dye. The exploration of dye&#8211;dye structures is impeded by long synthetic routes, incompatible synthetic conditions, or a mismatch of the desired properties. Here, we present the first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind dye&#8208;dye conjugates of boron difluoride complexes of formazanate and dipyrromethene ligands. These conjugates exhibit dual photoluminescence bands that reach the near&#8208;infrared spectral region and implicate anti&#8208;Kasha processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed the generation of polyanionic species that can reversibly tolerate the uptake of up to 6 electrons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that BF2 formazanates can serve as a synthetically accessible platform to build upon new classes &#160;of dye&#8208;dye conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulation in Charged Droplets Generates Distorted Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of various hydrogen&#8208;bonded resorcinarene&#8208;based capsules to bind &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkylbisDABCOnium (DnD) guests of different lengths was investigated in solution and in the gas phase. While no host&#8208;guest interactions were detected in solution, encapsulation could be achieved in the charged droplets formed during electrospray ionisation (ESI). This included guests which are far too long in their most stable conformation to fit inside the cavity of the capsules. A combination of three mass spectrometric techniques, collision&#8208;induced dissociation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry together with computational modelling allow us to determine the binding mode of the DnD guests inside the cavity of the capsules. Significant distortions of the guest into horseshoe&#8208;like arrangements are required to optimise cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with the host which also adopt distorted geometries with partially open hydrogen&#8208;bonding seams when binding longer guests. Such quasi &#8220;spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; capsules can form in the charged droplets during the ESI process as there is no competition between guest encapsulation and ion pair formation with the counterions that preclude encapsulation in solution. The encapsulation complexes are sufficiently stable in the gas phase &#8211; even when strained &#8211; because non&#8208;covalent interactions significantly strengthen in the absence of solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based chelation&#8208;type ligands were designed and a detailed evaluation of the light&#8208;modulated changes in their properties were carried out. The photo&#8208;induced enhancement of solubility of one of the azopyrazole&#8208;based ligands enabled its utilization in modulation of catalytic activity of CuAAC reaction in water.







Abstract
We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as chelation&#8208;type light&#8208;controllable ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility, especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized towards controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.

&lt;p&gt;We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine- and phenylazopyrazole-based molecular systems as chelation-type light-controllable ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light-tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility, especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized towards controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the Cell Performance of the SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy Anodes via In&#8208;Situ Reduction/Oxidation Coating Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon monoxide (SiO) has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity as an alternative material for conventional graphite anode, but its poor electrical conductivity and irreversible side reactions at the SiO/electrolyte interface seriously reduce its cycling stability. Here, to overcome the drawbacks, the dicharged SiO anode coated with Cu coating layer is elaborately designed by in&#8208;situ reduction method. Compared with the pristine SiO anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery (293 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), the obtained SiO/Cu composite presents superior cycling stability (1206 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). The tight combination of Cu particles and SiO significantly improves the conductivity of the composite, effectively inhibits the side&#8208;reaction between the active material and electrolyte. In addition, polypyrrole&#8208;coated SiO composites are further prepared by in&#8208;situ oxidation method, which delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1311 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles. The in&#8208;situ coating strategies in this work provide a new pathway for the development and practical application of high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode.</dc:description>

Abstract
Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8722; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5&#8197;min) and good sorption capacity (388&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.

         <title>Manipulation of Hierarchical Chiral Self&#8208;assembly and Anion Recognition by Supramolecular Systems of &#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, Pillar[5]arenes, and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, as a modulator, successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates and modulated the ternary co&#8208;assembly to form hierarchically chiral leaves. By substituting highly similar polyoxometalates, the accurate balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range interactions is demonstrated to be the key to the formation of chiral hierarchical microstructures.







Abstract
Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD/&#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8722; (X=Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8211;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>

         <dc:description>
Phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate (depicted by the turtle), is an important bioanion that plays multiple roles in metabolic processes. Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, resulting in insight to its intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. Results indicate that an axial phosphate and proton interchange play important structural roles with changing environment.







Abstract
Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate. Together, the results provide significant insight to phytate's intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. The phytate ion pairs hold the tetrameric macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 DMSO&#8208;d6&#8201;:&#8201;D2O indicate 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Regime Switch in the Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Silicates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallophotoredox catalyzed coupling of an aryl bromide with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate can lead to the formation of large quantity of side products when subjected to high intensity/high frequency irradiation. Two regimes were found to be possible; the ability to switch from the quantitative coupling to the simultaneous coupling and degradation of the silicate was observed.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an arylbromide (Ar&#8722;Br) with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate (R&#8722;Si&#8854;) has been analyzed in depth using a continuum of analytical techniques (EPR, fluorine NMR, electrochemistry, photophysics) and modeling (micro&#8208;kinetics and DFT calculations). These studies converged on the impact of four control parameters consisting in the initial concentrations of the iridium photocatalyst ([Ir]0), nickel precatalyst ([Ni]0) and silicate ([R&#8722;Si&#8854;]0) as well as light intensity I0 for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8722;Br and R&#8722;Si&#8854;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8722;Br with R&#8722;Si&#8854; smoothly leading to Ar&#8722;R, with no side&#8208;product from R&#8722;Si&#8854; and a second one in which R&#8722;Si&#8854; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8722;Br and degraded to R&#8722;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) have potential for delivering organotin(IV) compounds in cancer therapy due to their water solubility, stability, non&#8208;toxicity, and photoluminescence. Two nanosystems were developed by grafting organotin fragments and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid onto NGQDs. In vitro tests demonstrated high cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and minimal effects on non&#8208;cancer cells (HEK293T), with successful uptake and release of the metallodrug in cancer cells.







Abstract
The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in&#8197;vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group&#8197;5 Elements as Electron&#8208;Density Acceptors
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the term erythronium bond (EyB) is proposed to name an attractive noncovalent interaction between any electrophilic element of group&#8197;5 and electron&#8208;rich atoms (Lewis bases or anions).







Abstract
Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level, atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group&#8197;5 elements and electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These kinds of bonding are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term erythronium bond is proposed to denote these bonds. X&#8208;ray structures of vanadate&#8208;dependent bromoperoxidases show that these interactions are present also in biological systems.

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure of octahedral platinum complexes with halogens or chalcogens was revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field. The formal IV platinum oxidation state was in no case supported except in combination with oxygen and fluorine. A new interpretation of the oxidative addition process was also provided.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the inverted ligand field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8722;F and Pt&#8722;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the density of states plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8722;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the inverted ligand field.

The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the inverted ligand field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8722;F and Pt&#8722;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the density of states plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8722;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the inverted ligand field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition by In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we described organocatalytic spirocyclization of keto&#8208;enone tethered enals via a reductive Michael/aldol condensation/Michael domino sequence. This method granted us access to the architecturally complex spirocyclic spiroindene&#8208;2&#8208;caboxaldehyde frameworks with excellent selectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good to moderate yields. Formation of aminoisobenzofulvenes was a key intermediate for intramolecular Michael addition as final spirocyclization step.







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented by in&#8197;situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade by iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.

         <title>Dual Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions for the Conformational Control of Urea
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction has been developed as a means of establishing conformational control in sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing ureas. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives adopt a planar structure bearing an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement (X=S, Se). The rigidity of the structure and the acidity were found to increase in the order benzothiophene&lt;benzoselenophene ureas.







Abstract
Dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed as a novel means for the conformational control of urea derivatives. The formation of a chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction at both sides of the urea carbonyl group was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as computational studies including non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) plot index analysis, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis via DFT calculations. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives that bear chalcogen atoms (X=S and Se) adopt a planar structure via the carbonyl oxygen (O) with an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement on the same side of the molecule. The rigidity of the conformational lock was evaluated using the molecular arrangement in the crystal and the rotational barrier of benzochalcogenophene ring, which indicated a stronger conformational lock in benzoselenophene than in benzothiophene urea derivatives. Furthermore, the acidity of the urea derivatives increases according to the Lewis&#8208;acidic properties of the chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, whereby benzoselenophene urea is more acidic than benzothiophene urea. Tweezer&#8208;shaped urea derivatives were prepared, and their stereostructure proved the viability of the conformational control for defining the location of the substituents on the urea framework.

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solutions of 2,4,5,7&#8208;tetranitrofluorenone oximate (1) are blue (&#955;max&#8776;600&#8197;nm) in aprotic solvents, independently of polarity, while a red color (&#955;max&lt;560&#8197;nm) is obtained in protic solvents. The hypsochromic shift in absorption is in excellent correlation with the H&#8208;bond donating ability (&#945;) of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). [3]Helical, configurationally labile, 1 is further applied in recognition of enantiopure HBDs that induced electronic circular dichroism (ECD) upon complexation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. This study reports on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of anilines in the presence of aliphatic amines is illustrated utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction. Further, the defined principles of reactivity are shown to be broadly extended to other electrophiles.







Abstract
Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups are of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. This study reports a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction, anilines were shown to react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, this principle of reactivity was extended to other electrophiles and conditions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 grown on nickel mesh by electrodeposition for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly excellent and stable catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually pivotal for clean energy development. In this work, a heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 (Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1) was developed via simple one&#8208;step electrodeposition onto nickel mesh. The heterogeneous interface structure generates sufficient active sites, significantly improving OER performance with an overpotential of 174 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10), while Tafel slope is only 43.0 mV dec&#8722;1. In particular, Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1 is still able to operate stably at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 for 100 h without obvious potential decay. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ was detected by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, proving that the heterogeneous catalyst could stabilize the high&#8208;valence state of nickel as active sites to its superior OER performance. This work provides a convenient synthetic strategy for&#160;forming heterogeneous catalysts toward efficient water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28 g g&#8208;1&#160;at 25 &#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retained its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Bicyclophane&#8208;Based Molecular Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modular synthesis of a series of nanoscale phenylene bicyclophanes with an intraaanular orthogonal pillar is described. The compounds are obtained by a Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling condensation and are characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as well as in situ scanning tunneling microscopy at the solid/liquid interface of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. In addition, their structures and conformations are supported by quantum chemical calculations, also after adsorption to the substrate. A set of two alkyl chain substitution patterns as well as a combination of both was investigated with respect to their ability to form extended 2D&#8208;crystalline superstructures on graphite. It shows that not the most densely packed surface coverage gives the most stable structure, but the largest number of alkyl chains per molecule determines the structural robustness to alterations at the pillar functionality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to formate was achieved (TONmax = ca. 3800) in the presence of the neutral, halide&#8208;free, coordinatively saturated tris(carbonyl) manganese pincer&#8208;type complex [Mn(PNP)(CO)3], bearing a diarylamido pincer&#8208;type PNP ligand, using DBU as base and LiOTf as Lewis acid additive, under mild reaction conditions (60 bar, 80 &#176;C). DFT calculations suggest that the precatalyst activation key step occurs by intermolecular, base assisted dihydrogen heterolytic splitting rather than by the expected ligand&#8208;assisted intramolecular MLC&#8208;type mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl esters can be readily prepared through thiol substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromo esters followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide. Enzymatic resolution with lipoprotein lipase provides both the unreacted esters and corresponding &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl carboxylic acids in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Subsequent decarboxylative halogenation, dihalogenation, trihalogenation and cross&#8208;coupling gives rise to functionalized sulfoxides. The method has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of a potent inhibitor of 15&#8208;prostaglandin dehydrogenase.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;basedPaddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMRChemical Shifts: Insights from QuantumMechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel com&#8208;plexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of anempirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere aboutthe bimetallic core. Only recently, a H(C)Rhtriple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously incon&#8208;ceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts onthe electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded ef&#8208;fects are dramatic: formal replacement of one out ofeight O&#8208;atoms in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of thecorresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000 ppm. The cur&#8208;rent paper provides the framework that allowsthis and related experimental observations made with a setof 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted.In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that theshielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of theequatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis.Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shield&#8208;ing but exert an electronic cis&#8208;effect that onto the neighboring equatorial sites. Furthermore, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic trans&#8208;effect of ligands ofdifferent donor strengths is reflected in the 103 Rh NMR shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ru Nanoboxes with a Hexagonal Close&#8208;Packed Structure by Templating with Ag Nanocubes and Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and high utilization efficiency of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8208;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a Ru(acac)3 solution in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise into a suspension of Ag nanocubes in EG at 170 &#8451;, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the Ru(III) precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers.

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core-shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a Ru(acac)3 solution in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise into a suspension of Ag nanocubes in EG at 170 &#8451;, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the Ru(III) precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as-obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluate the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses using a model hydrogenation reaction and both samples show excellent performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative (4 + 2) Cycloaddition Reactions of 4&#8208;Vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;Nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative (4 + 2) cycloaddition reaction between 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes has been developed to produce highly valuable, densely functionalized tetrahydroquinolines in moderate to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The optimised protocol tolerates a range of substituted 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes, which represent an under&#8208;utilized class of dipolarophile for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cycloadditions. The employed reaction methodology facilitates efficient cycloaddition with both N&#8208;H&#8208; and N&#8208;Ts&#8208;4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone dipole precursors. The stereochemistry of the major and minor diastereomeric (4 + 2) cycloadducts was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. A mechanistic rationale for the high intrinsic diastereoselectivity and preliminary enantioselective experiments are also presented. The tetrahydroquinoline cycloadduct products feature numerous pendant functionalities, including a vinyl handle, an internal alkyne motif and a nitro functionality (which functions as a latent C&#8208;3 nitrogen substituent) for further synthetic manipulations.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes by an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route for electrochemical carbon dioxide activation was discovered for a manganese tricarbonyl complex. This complex first undergoes an H&#8208;atom transfer through a non&#8208;innocent ancillary ligand before subsequent reductions towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;b&#8208;Br) (where HL=2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL=1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1&#8201;b&#8208;Br. Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2&#8201;a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.

         <title>Hexakis&#8208;TIPS&#8208;Alkynylated Nonacenes: Persistent and Processible</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble nonacenes are stabilized via triisopropylsilyl&#8208;ethynylation, halogenation and methoxylation. The substitution resulted in the most stable nonacenes to date. Two derivatives were characterized by crystal structure analysis and one derivative is tested as thin&#8208;film transistor material.







Abstract
Four substituted nonacenes were prepared and characterized by UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl(TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8211;9&#8197;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#956;e=0.007&#8197;cm2/Vs; &#956;h=0.023&#8197;cm2/Vs).

         <title>Synchronous Proton&#8208;Hydride Transfer by a Pyrazole&#8208;Functionalized Protic Mn(I) Complex in Catalytic Alcohol Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protic Mn(I) complex featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the initial alcohol dehydrogenation step proceeds through a concerted proton and hydride transfers to pyrazolato N and Mn, respectively, on the metal&#8208;ligand construct.







Abstract
A series of Mn(I) complexes Mn(L1)(CO)3Br, Mn(L2)(CO)3Br, Mn(L1)(CO)3(OAc) and Mn(L3)(CO)3Br [L1=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, L2=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine, L3=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine] were synthesized and fully characterized.

     alt="Synchronous Proton-Hydride Transfer by a Pyrazole-Functionalized Protic Mn(I) Complex in Catalytic Alcohol Dehydrogenative Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A protic Mn(I) complex&lt;/b&gt; featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the initial alcohol dehydrogenation step proceeds through a concerted proton and hydride transfers to pyrazolato N and Mn, respectively, on the metal-ligand construct.

         <title>Transition Metal Ions Influence the Performance of Photodetector of Two&#8208;Dimensional CdS Nanoplatelets</title>

The insertion of copper ions inside the two&#8208;dimensional CdS NPLs exhibits bright red photoluminescence and higher performance of photodetectors.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke's shifted emission at ~685&#8197;nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45&#8197;&#956;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs. Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120&#8197;ms), ~600&#8197;times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300&#8197;times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dyotropic Rearrangement of Diarylethenes: Scope, Mechanism, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual light&#8208;induced rearrangement of diarylethenes to products with complex tricyclic DihydroDithiaAcenaphthylene (DDA) core has been discovered by accident in 1999. Based on the data accumulated by 2022, it can be considered as a promising photoreaction that provides access to photo&#8208; and thermally stable colored species (dyes) with interesting properties and a range of applications.







Abstract
Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.

         <title>Modeling Reactivity of Nitrite and Nitrous Acid at a Phenolate Bridged Dizinc(II) Site: Insights into NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide from (in)organic nitrite at zinc(II): Reactions of a dizinc(II) coordination site with organonitrite or nitrous acid (RONO, R=tBu/amyl/H) result in the formation of a dark green colored arene&#8208;NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex. One electron reductive transformation of the NO+ charge&#8208;transfer moiety and zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex towards NO, in the presence of exogenous reductants, have been illustrated.







Abstract
Although nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at various transition metals including Fe and Cu are relatively well explored, examples of such a reaction at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) site are limited. The present report aims to gain insights into the reactivity of nitrite anions, nitrous acid (HONO), and organonitrite (RONO) at a dizinc(II) site. A phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II)&#8208;aqua complex [LHZnII(OH2)]2(ClO4)2 (1H&#8208;Aq, where LH=tridentate N,N,O&#8208;donor monoanionic ligand) is illustrated to react with tBuONO to provide a metastable arene&#8208;nitrosonium charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. UV&#8208;vis, FTIR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses suggests the presence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 arene&#8208;nitrosonium moiety. Furthermore, the reactivity of a structurally characterized zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) with a proton&#8208;source demonstrates HONO reactivity at the dizinc(II) site. Reactivity of both RONO (R=alkyl/H) at the phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II) site provides NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. Subsequently, the reactions of 2H with exogenous reductants (such as ferrocene, thiol, phenol, and catechol) have been illustrated to generate NO. In addition, NO yielding reactivity of [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) in the presence of the above&#8208;mentioned reductants have been compared with the reactions of complex 2H. Thus, this report sheds light on the transformations of NO2&#8722;/RONO (R=alkyl/H) to NO/NO+ at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) coordination motif.

         <title>Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;Analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combinations of diethyl ether&#8208; and carbene&#8208;coordinated diarylberyllium and beryllium dibromide complexes were shown to undergo reversible and irreversible Schlenk&#8208;type redistribution reactions depending on the steric demand of the aryl substituents affording the corresponding arylberyllium bromide complexes.Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;Analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects (Jones and Helling)







Abstract
The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides, are systematically studied. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp; Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp=2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp=c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2=C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk-type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides, are systematically studied. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1Ar&lt;/b&gt;, Ar=Tip, Tcpp; Tip=2,4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Tcpp=2,4,6-Cyp&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cyp=&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) affords the Grignard-analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;3Ar&lt;/b&gt;, Ar=Tip, Tcpp).

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on synthesis of a new bright blue&#8208;green fluorophore for targeted delivery of biologically active substances containing a carboxyl group. The resulting hybrids were thoroughly studied to understand their photophysical properties and behavior under various conditions. The mechanism of photorelease of caging molecules were studied. Biological experiments demonstrated their bioavailability and easy penetration into living cells.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1H, 13C NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLC&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, we wished to synthesize P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of the above mentioned N&#8208;heterocycles. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y = alkoxy, aryl) (30%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, our method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells.

         <dc:description>Peptide and protein bioconjugation sees ever&#8208;growing applications in the pharmaceutical sector. Novel strategies and reagents that can address the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity issues inherent to these biomolecules, while delivering stable and functionalizable conjugates, are therefore needed. Herein, we introduce the crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) reagent JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 for the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. This easily accessed compound gives access to peptide conjugates or stapled peptides under mild and tuneable conditions.

         <title>Exceptionally stable and super&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts derived from semiconducting metal phosphonate frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two new isotypic semiconductive metal phosphonate frameworks Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8211;&#160;is 1,4&#8209;naphthalenediphosphonate). Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] have optical bandgaps of 1.7 eV and 2.5 eV respectively, which are within the semiconductive regime. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst generated a lower overpotential of 374 mV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8211;1&#160;at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2&#160;in alkaline electrolyte (1 mol L&#8211;1&#160;KOH), which is indicative of remarkably superior reaction kinetics. Benchmarking of the oxygen evolution reaction, OER of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] materials as precatalyst coupled with nickel foam (NF) showed exceptional long&#8208;term stability at a current density of 50 mA cm&#8211;2for water splitting compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C/RuO2@NF after 30 h in 1 mol L&#8208;1&#160;KOH. In order to further understand the OER mechanism, the transformation of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] into its electrocatalytically active species was investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the iconic characteristics of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is the possesssion of guest&#8208;accessible pores. Increasing pore size has a direct and often beneficial impact on a MOF&#8217;s adsorption and separation properties. However, as pore size increases, the resulting void spaces are often filled by interpenetrated frameworks, where one or more networks crystallize within the pore system of another identical network, reducing the MOF&#8217;s free volume and pore size. Furthermore, due to the thermodynamic favorability of interpenetration during solvothermal synthesis, techniques to synthetically differentiate interpenetrated from non&#8208;interpenetrated MOFs are paramount. Herein we report the synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 via halide mediated deinterpenetrative conversion of Zn4O&#8208;derived IRMOF&#8208;9. IRMOF&#8208;9, when treated with ethylammonium bromide, is quasi&#8208;selectively etched, revealing the non&#8208;interpenetrated analogue, IRMOF&#8208;10 (deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9), which can be isolated prior to complete dissolution by the bromide solution. Dye adsorption, surface area and pore size distribution analysis, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and elemental analysis are consistent with successful deinterpenetration.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism  and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.</dc:description>
