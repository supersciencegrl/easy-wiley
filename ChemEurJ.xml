         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Benzylic Substitutions Through &#951;3&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;Metal Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their significant synthetic value, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitutions remain undeveloped compared to the Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction, primarily due to the inherent challenge associated with endothermic dearomatization. Several catalytic strategies have been explored to overcome the corresponding issues, including single metal, bimetallic, metal/organo, and ternary catalysis.








Abstract
Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitution is conceptually analogous to asymmetric allylic substitution, proceeding via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;metal and &#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;metal intermediates, respectively, the development of the former, involving benzylic electrophiles, has received comparatively less attention within the synthetic community. This limited progress is largely attributed to the low reactivity of benzylic electrophiles and the associated challenge in achieving stereoselective control. Over the past several decades, different catalytic strategies, such as single metal catalysis, bimetallic catalysis, metal/organo catalysis, and ternary catalysis, have been developed to address these challenges. Asymmetric versions of these transformations have also been established, enabling the construction of stereocenters either at the benzylic electrophiles, at nucleophile, or simultaneously at both sites. This review provides a comprehensive overview of this field from its inception to the present. It summarizes advances in substrate scope, mechanistic understanding, synthetic applications, and remaining challenges, with the aim of fostering further progress in this emerging area.

This review provides a comprehensive summary of key computational methods, databases, and tools, along with practical guidance to facilitate the application of artificial intelligence in drug target discovery.








ABSTRACT
The identification of drug targets remains one of the most critical challenges in pharmaceutical research. The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing this landscape by enabling more efficient and accurate drug&#8208;target interaction prediction. AI&#8208;driven approaches can integrate and analyze massive biomedical datasets, elucidating complex signaling networks and providing systematic insights into drug mechanisms of action. These developments have greatly accelerated virtual screening, binding affinity estimation, and target identification. However, despite these advancements, key challenges persist, such as ensuring the precision of predictions and overcoming the barriers to integrating AI tools with drug target discovery. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent public databases, advanced computational methods, and user&#8208;friendly AI tools, highlighting both their potential and challenges. It also offers practical guidance for researchers without computational expertise, illustrating how these technologies can be effectively incorporated into current research workflows to advance drug target discovery and ultimately accelerate the development of novel therapeutic drugs.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages for Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent organic cage (COC) is a significant concern for molecular recognition due to its preorganized 3D cavities, customizable binding sites, and outstanding chemical stability. Here, this concept article briefly summarizes the common COCs construction strategies and demonstrates how condensation of these COCs influences the encapsulation of various guests.








ABSTRACT
Molecular recognition is a crucial process in multiple areas, including separation, storage, and catalysis etc. Covalent organic cages (COCs), owing to their preorganized 3D cavities, customizable binding sites, and outstanding chemical stability, have been widely used for molecular recognition. Among the components of COCs, the covalent linkers play a crucial role in molecular recognition by shaping cavities and providing noncovalent interactions. In this concept, we exemplified recent progress in COC&#8208;based host&#8208;guest recognition, briefly summarized the bonding strategies (both dynamic and irreversible) used in covalent linkers for COC construction, and discussed how these linkers influence guest encapsulation by adjusting size, shape, and binding sites of their cavities. These insights are expected to provide a reference for the design of novel COCs for molecular recognition.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Commodity Plastics: Advances in Polyethylene and Polystyrene Valorization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in the catalytic oxidative upcycling of polyethylene and polystyrene, emphasizing catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and product selectivity. By comparing different catalytic systems and oxidation strategies, it highlights how molecular&#8208;level control of active oxygen species can transform inert plastics into valuable chemicals. The review also outlines future directions in catalyst innovation, process optimization, and sustainability assessment to guide the development of efficient and industrially viable plastic upcycling technologies.








ABSTRACT
Polyethylene and polystyrene are among the most representative hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade plastic due to their chemical inertness and massive generation, making their efficient upcycling a pressing challenge for environmental sustainability. Conventional recycling methods, such as incineration, landfilling, and mechanical processing, often cause high energy consumption, severe pollution, and product devaluation, which is unfavorable for circular utilization of plastics. In contrast, chemical recycling, particularly catalytic oxidation, has recently gained much attention for enabling plastic valorization under relatively mild conditions, with straightforward separation processes and high&#8208;value products. Despite these advantages, catalytic oxidation remains at an early stage, facing challenges such as unclear catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationships, insufficient reactivity, and limited selectivity. To address these issues, this review highlights recent advances in the catalytic oxidative conversion of polyethylene and polystyrene, focusing on catalyst design, reaction mechanism elucidation, and product selectivity control. Furthermore, perspectives are provided on future research directions, including the development of novel catalysts, optimization of mass transfer, regulation of reactive oxygen species, adaptability to mixed plastic waste, techno&#8208;economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and reaction safety evaluation.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis and Applications of Functional Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for rare earth metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs), emphasizing the design and roles of metal nodes and ligand structures, and provides a comprehensive summary of their current applications in detecting volatile organic compounds, small molecules, cations, anions, biomarkers, and temperature, as well as in optical encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and rare earth separation.








ABSTRACT
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant attention over the past few decades due to their diverse chemical architectures and tunable physicochemical properties, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2025. By integrating various metal nodes with organic linkers, MOFs offer extensive opportunities for rational design, controlled synthesis, and multifunctional applications. From structural and functional perspectives, MOFs incorporating rare earth (RE) elements (such as scandium, yttrium, and the 15 lanthanides) constitute a distinct subclass of MOFs. The structural diversity of RE metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs) is intrinsically correlated with their unique functional characteristics, which primarily stem from the precise selection of metal centers and the deliberate design of organic ligands. This review presents a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for RE&#8208;MOFs, emphasizing the design and roles of metal nodes and ligand structures, and provides a comprehensive summary of their current applications in detecting volatile organic compounds, small molecules, cations, anions, biomarkers, and temperature, as well as in optical encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and rare eart separation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Organocatalytic House&#8208;Meinwald Rearrangement for the Facile Synthesis of Aldehydes: Swift Access to Ibuprofen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use readily available epoxides and 0.5 mol% bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2N) as a catalyst to synthesize a broad range of aldehydes in yields ranging from 89% to 97%. Furthermore, we identified aldehyde dimerization intermediates at lower temperatures and observed their cleavage at 55 &#176;C. To demonstrate the applicability of our new approach, we synthesized ibuprofen in a three&#8208;step process with an overall yield of 90%.








ABSTRACT
We present a new organocatalytic method for synthesizing aldehydes under mild conditions using readily accessible terminal epoxides as starting materials and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2NH) as the catalyst. We identified intermediate aldehyde dimerization products at lower temperatures and observed their cleavage at 55&#176;C. We isolated the products in yields of 89&#8211;97% using catalyst loadings as low as 0.5 mol%. To underline the applicability of our new approach, we synthesized ibuprofen in a three&#8208;step process and overall yield of 90%.

Friedel&#8211;Crafts Arylation of Indoles: Use of an iminosulfonate derivative as the photoacid generator for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts arylation reaction between aldehydes and indoles under inert atmosphere.








ABSTRACT
Photochemistry enables transformations inaccessible through ground&#8208;state pathways. We report a sustainable and operationally simple Friedel&#8211;Crafts arylation using benzophenone oxime tosylate, in low catalyst loading, as the photoacid generator under inert conditions. The method accommodates a broad substrate scope, affording diarylmethane derivatives in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies elucidate key intermediates driving the transformation.

         <title>Stable Ambiphilic Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imino)&#8208;Substituted Terminal Olefin and Its Diazoolefin Derivative Exhibits Unusual Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic bis&#8208;imino terminal olefin was synthesized and comprehensively characterized, demonstrating air, moisture, and thermal stability. It shows distinct reactivity compared to traditional NHOs, leading to the isolation of two unique N&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
In this article, we report a novel bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imino) terminal olefin, [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2] [CAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene], which exhibits reactivity distinct from traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The use of the (CAAC)&#8211;derived ambiphilic N&#8208;heterocyclic imino fragment {(CAAC)N&#8210;} was crucial in imparting the unique properties of [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2]. The imino groups act as strong electron donors, rendering the terminal olefin polar through &#960;&#8208;delocalization, whereas the carbenic carbon of CAAC introduces an electrophilic site into the imino substituent. This combination results in an inherently ambiphilic olefin that displays unusual reactivity. Specifically, the reaction of [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2] with tosyl azide, under varying stoichiometric conditions, furnished four distinct nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds, including two unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were carried out to elucidate the bonding features of the ambiphilic bis&#8208;imino terminal olefin as well as the newly formed heterocycles.

The power of catalytic promiscuity: The enantioselective conjugate hydrocyanation of enals remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for biocatalysis. Here, we report the redesign of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase for the asymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation of aromatic enals, expanding the reaction scope of iminium&#8208;based enzyme catalysis to include an additional new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction.








ABSTRACT
The enantioselective conjugate hydrocyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report the redesign of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) into an efficient biocatalyst capable of promoting the asymmetric conjugate addition of hydrogen cyanide (generated in situ from trimethylsilyl cyanide) to aromatic enals via an iminium activation pathway. The evolved variant DERA&#8208;CN enables the efficient formation of various C4&#8208;nitriles with high conversions (up to 99%) and good enantioselectivity (up to 98% e.e.). Control experiments revealed a stepwise process involving enzyme&#8208;catalyzed conjugate hydrocyanation followed by spontaneous 1,2&#8208;addition of cyanide. Substrates with various electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are tolerated, providing access to various enantioenriched nitriles. This work expands the scope of DERA&#8208;promoted iminium catalysis and provides a rare enzymatic platform for asymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation under mild aqueous conditions.

This work expands the scope of DERA-promoted iminium catalysis and provides a rare enzymatic platform for asymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation under mild aqueous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Grafting of 3,4,5&#8208;Trihydroxypiperidine Iminosugars Onto Multivalent Scaffolds via Double Reductive Amination Provides New GCase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small set of low&#8208;valency multivalent 3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxypiperidines was prepared through double reductive amination (DRA) of a sugar&#8208;derived dialdehyde. Among them, trivalent derivative 37 emerged as a potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GCase) inhibitor displaying an unexpected mixed&#8208;type kinetic profile. The integration of kinetic analysis, NMR, docking, and MD simulations shed light on the molecular basis of the binding to the target enzyme.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;valency multivalent iminosugars have recently emerged as promising inhibitors of the therapeutically relevant enzyme &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GCase). A new synthetic strategy has been developed to simultaneously build more than one trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar unit onto a polyamine scaffold via double reductive amination (DRA) of a d&#8208;mannose derived dialdehyde. Five divalent derivatives, using both aliphatic and aromatic diamines and a trivalent compound based on an aromatic scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated as GCase inhibitors. Only oligomers with an aromatic core (26, 31, and 37) strongly inhibit GCase with IC50 values in the low micromolar range and activity enhancements, when compared to the monovalent counterpart, that confirm the occurrence of a positive multivalent effect. Kinetic analysis for divalent 31 and trivalent 37 revealed a mixed&#8208;type inhibition. To rationalize the unexpected behavior of 37, an integrated biophysical and computational approach based on STD&#8208;NMR, docking, and MD simulations was employed, allowing to clarify the structural basis for its inhibitory profile and paving the way to the rational design of novel inhibitors able to bridge multiple interaction sites of the target enzyme.

         <title>Multistate Azobenzene&#8211;Norbornadiene Photoswitches for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systems consisting of two different photoswitches (azobenzene and norbornadiene) are presented, which can be switched by light, store energy, and release it again. The combination of the switching units leads to synergistic effects.








ABSTRACT
The combination of two photochromic molecules into a multimodal photoswitch offers the potential to generate new properties related to molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. A system can only be considered suitable for MOST applications if it meets key criteria, including a high quantum yield and an extended half&#8208;life of the high&#8208;energy isomer. Achieving this combination remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the coupling of an azobenzene unit (AZO) with a norbornadiene system (NBD) via ester functions to develop new bi&#8208; and trimodal AZO&#8208;NBD photoswitches that exhibit synergistic effects. Photochemical studies reveal that both the NBD and AZO components of the hybrid are switchable. In one case, all isomer types could be selectively produced. Furthermore, each metastable unit can be switched back independently to its corresponding thermodynamically stable form. The quantum yields and half&#8208;lives for the NBD and AZO components of the hybrid system could be determined separately. The integration of AZOs has demonstrated the potential to extend the half&#8208;lives of NBDs to up to 122 days in certain cases, as confirmed through comparative analysis with reference systems. The enhanced rate of back&#8208;conversion was further facilitated by the presence of TFA as a catalyst.

         <title>Impact of Hole Transporting Layers on the Composition of Chemical Vapor Deposited Perovskite and Performance of Semitransparent Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal that the surface properties of the substrate play a crucial role in determining the surface composition and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films. By optimizing the HTL, we achieved 17.5% efficiency for semitransparent perovskite solar module via all vacuum deposition processes.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers good scalability, substrate compatibility, and solvent&#8208;free processing for metal halide perovskite films fabrication, yet limited control over the film composition has hindered the device performance compared to solution&#8208;based methods. Herein, we investigate how the substrate surface property affect the composition and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films fabricated by CVD. By changing the hole transporting layers (HTLs), different crystallization process and chemical stoichiometry of perovskite films have been observed. Perovskite films grown on nickel oxide|self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit a more stoichiometric buried surface, along with a higher work function (WF) and enhanced p&#8208;type character that are favorable for hole transport. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate all vapor&#8208;deposited semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 18.0%, retaining &#8764;100% of the initial performance after 500 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1). Furthermore, we achieve a champion efficiency of 17.5% for semitransparent mini&#8208;modules fabricated via the all&#8208;vacuum process.

         <title>XFEL&#8208;Detected Peroxide Formation From the S3 State Supports the Low Oxidation State over the High Oxidation State Paradigm in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations show that peroxide formation from the S3 state is inconsistent with the HOS model, as Mn(IV) readily oxidizes peroxide to O2. In contrast, the LOS model stabilizes the peroxide observed by XFEL, since Mn(III) cannot promote further oxidation.








ABSTRACT
The mechanism of O&#8211;O bond formation in PSII is still debated. Although it is generally accepted to occur during the S3 &#8594; [S4] &#8594; S0 transition, some studies suggest it may already begin in the S3 state. Notably, the 2017 XFEL study by Suga et&#160;al. supports this hypothesis by reporting structural features consistent with a peroxide intermediate formed from the S3 state. Here, we present DFT calculations showing that, in the high oxidation state (HOS) model, O&#8211;O coupling starting from the S3 state with the hydroxo&#8211;oxo configuration is kinetically feasible, forming a peroxide intermediate via a modest activation energy of 19.5&#160;kcal/mol. However, in the HOS model, the resulting peroxide would be readily converted to O2 with &#916;G&#8225; = 11&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, inconsistent with experimental observations that O2 release proceeds only after reaching the [S4] state. In contrast, we show that if peroxide forms from the S3 state, its persistence is more plausibly explained by the low oxidation state (LOS) model, where further conversion to superoxide or O2 is energetically unfavorable. This distinction between these two models stems from the greater oxidizing power of Mn(IV) in the HOS paradigm relative to Mn(III) in the LOS paradigm in promoting peroxide&#8208;to&#8208;O2 conversion.

         <title>Triggering and Preventing Cyclization of o&#8208;Amino&#8208;Guanidinobenzenes to 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
o&#8208;Amino&#8208;guanidinobenzenes are generally prone to cyclization to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;benzimidazoles. In this work, strategies to prevent such cyclizations are developed, allowing to use these compounds as ligands in coordination chemistry and for the design of novel (unsymmetrical) redox&#8208;active ligands.








ABSTRACT
Aromatic compounds in which a primary or secondary amino group is positioned next (in ortho position) to a guanidino group have been reported as intermediates in a variety of reactions, but are generally prone to cyclization to give 2&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazoles. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis, based on experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, of the stability and reactivity of these compounds. It is shown that cyclization reactions are triggered by Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids. The analysis discloses strategies allowing to prevent cyclization by careful choice of the guanidino group and/or substituent at the amino group. The results of this analysis allowed the synthesis of first unsymmetrical diguanidinobenzene molecules and coordination compounds with o&#8208;amino&#8208;guanidinobenzene ligands, paving the way for the development of aromatic compounds with adjacent amino and guanidino groups as a versatile class of redox&#8208;active organic molecules.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of C&#8208;F Bonds to the Phosphoranide Ion [P(C2F5)2F2]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 2, 9 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difluorobis(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoranide anion (&#955;$\lambda $4&#963;$\sigma $4&#8208;phosphate) reacts with substrates containing activated C&#9472;F bonds (Rf&#160; = &#160;perfluoroaryl, &#8208;alkenyl, and &#8208;acetyl) yielding corresponding trifluorophoshates. The colorless solids exhibit a high thermal stability and are bench stable. This reaction behavior extends the toolbox for possible functionalization of inherently strong C&#9472;F bonds.








ABSTRACT
Oxidative additions of C&#9472;Hal bonds (Hal&#160; = &#160;F, Cl, Br, I) are widely known for a variety of transition metal complexes owing to their range of oxidation states and flexible coordination sphere. Low valent main group element compounds were shown to mimic this reaction behavior, due to the propensity of changing their oxidation state and coordination number by +2. Yet the addition to C&#9472;F bonds is especially challenging due to a large bond dissociation energy. While several examples are known for compounds from group 13 and 14, only few reports demonstrate this type of reaction for compounds from group 15. Herein we report the first anionic P(III) species undergoing an oxidative addition of C&#9472;F bonds. The tetracoordinated [P(C2F5)2F2]&#8722;&#8208;anion reacts readily with fluorinated arenes, olefins, and acid fluorides yielding respective hexacoordinated P(V) phosphates under mild conditions.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Toluene Oxidation Electrocatalysis by a Carbon&#8208;Nanotube&#8208;Supported Dicopper(II, II) Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
The functionalization of a dicopper(II, II) complex with a pyrene anchoring group allows to build functional electrodes for the toluene partial oxidation in different solvents.








ABSTRACT
A novel dicopper(II, II) complex (Cpyrene) was attached on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes resulting in a nanohybrid electrode (MWCNT@Cpyrene) able to partially oxidize toluene to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol with 300 and 409 TON h&#8722;1, respectively, in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene. Exchanging the solvent by acetonitrile leads to the additional N&#8208;benzylacetamide formation from the C&#8211;N coupling of toluene and in situ solvent oxidation with 313 TON h&#8722;1 at room temperature.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Methods for the Synthesis of All Three Bonds of the Alkyne's Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free methods for the synthesis of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond are reviewed. After analysis of several named reactions and discussion of improvements, recent advances in the synthesis of alkynes are discussed. Each section contains a proposed reaction mechanism and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches.








Abstract
Alkynes are among the most useful functional groups in synthetic chemistry, as they are excellent starting materials for various reactions and serve as valuable precursors during total synthesis. Despite the high number of transformations that utilize alkynes as substrates, few methods actually exist to synthesize them. Known methods involve several synthetic steps, harsh conditions, or cryogenic temperatures, which render them inconvenient and inefficient. This review of alkyne syntheses cover methods that enable the formation of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot fashion. This review offers a guide to gauge if current methods are potentially suitable to be scaled and used in industry and pharmaceutical processes.

         <title>Unveiling the Chemical Space of Astin&#8208;Type Peptides in Aster Tataricus, Cyanodermella Asteris, and Talaromyces Islandicus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Aster tataricus and its endophytic fungus Cyanodermella asteris are sources of a unique class of halogenated pentapeptides called astins. In addition, the fungus Talaromyces islandicus produces the astin&#8208;related class of pentapeptides, cyclochlorotines. Through molecular networking and mass spectrometry fragmentation data, we uncover a huge chemical diversity among the astin and cyclochlorotine pool of pentapeptides, which also reflects the genetic homology of both nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) systems and deepens our understanding of astin biosynthesis and enzymology.








ABSTRACT
The plant Aster tataricus L.f. is known as the main source of astin&#8208;type cyclopentapeptides. However, recent studies have shown that the endophytic fungus Cyanodermella asteris contains a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) ast encoding for astin core&#8208;structure biosynthesis and that it produces three astins, namely astins C, F, and G. The foodborne fungus Talaromyces islandicus produces the structurally highly related cyclochlorotine mycotoxins encoded by the BGC cct with significant genetic homology to ast from C. asteris. We thus became interested in exploring and comparing the astin&#8208;type peptide diversity found in these three source organisms to answer the long&#8208;standing question of the true metabolic origin of the astins. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based molecular networking and fragmentation trees revealed that A. tataricus, C. asteris, and T. islandicus indeed contain many more derivatives, hence uncovering a huge peptide chemodiversity resulting from promiscuous NRPS systems regarding amino acid selectivity. Both NRPS systems produce structurally related and even a number of identical compounds. Our findings reveal comprehensive metabolic insights strongly indicating that the endophyte C. asteris is the sole producer of the astin peptide family and, contrary to previous assumptions, metabolic cross&#8208;talk with the host plant is unlikely to have a major impact on astin structural diversity.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards Darobactin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need for new antibiotics led us to develop a new methodology for the synthesis of the natural product darobactin A selectively targeting gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the synthesis of strained indole&#8208;containing macrocycles. Key steps comprise a nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8211;Bartoli indole synthesis&#8211;Negishi coupling alkylation sequence as well as a Larock indole macrolactamization.








ABSTRACT
We describe our efforts toward the total synthesis of darobactin A, an antibiotic that selectively targets Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The first route comprised the preparation of two separate advanced fragments. The unusual ether&#8208;linked tryptophan moiety was constructed utilizing a nucleophilic aromatic substitution&#8208;Bartoli indole synthesis&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence, while C&#8208;H arylation was used to prepare the &#946;&#8208;arylated lysine scaffold. Larock indole synthesis was confirmed as a valuable approach to achieve the first macrocyclization. An approach using macrolactamization for the construction of the second, western macrocycle proved to be unsuitable for the darobactin A scaffold. Thus, a second strategy focused on the synthesis of both macrocycles through two distinct intramolecular Larock indole syntheses that further brought valuable insights into the atroposelectivity of such reactions. Herein, we report our study toward the total synthesis of darobactin A, including the synthesis of advanced intermediates.

         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthesis of the dinucleotide 4 for a projected future total synthesis of the m7G cap 1. Highlights of the route include: 1) a 3&#697;&#8208;H&#8208;phosphonate/5&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate Michaelis&#8208;Arbuzov coupling to forge the 3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;phosphoroselenolate; 2) an Amosova reductive selenomethylation to install the 2&#697;&#8208;SeMe; 3) a solid CPR II 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphitylation; and 4) an aq. tBuO2H 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphite oxidation without accompanying selenoxide formation. Also, MeCN has been found to be especially beneficial for the SN2 reactions of 10 and the iodide 12.








ABSTRACT
In this paper, a solution&#8208;phase total synthesis is described of the 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#697;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#697;&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;adenosine 3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;phosphoroselenolate guanosine dinucleotide (4) using a rt, 2,6&#8208;lutidine&#8208;mediated, nucleoside 3&#697;&#8208;H&#8208;phosphonate/5&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate Michaelis&#8208;Arbuzov ligative coupling, whose potential mechanism is discussed herein. Our route to 4 is predicated upon the highly efficient new 2&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;triflate selenocyanate anion displacement of 10 in MeCN, to obtain the 2&#697;&#8208;selenocyanate 9, which was allied with an Amosova NaBH4/MeI mediated reductive selenomethylation in MeOH. A novel solid CPR II&#8208;mediated 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphitylation of the dinucleotide alcohol 6 and a 70% aqueous t&#8208;BuO2H oxidation successfully installed the 5&#697;&#8208;O&#8208;phosphate moiety within 4 without oxidizing the 2&#697;&#8208;selenomethyl group. It is envisaged that 4 will be of value for a future total synthesis of the m7G cap 1; a molecule of potential utility for therapeutic mRNA manufacture.

         <title>Boric Acid Promoted Base&#8208;Free Chan&#8208;Lam Amination Reaction: A Computationally Inspired Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico studies are carried out to underpin the mechanistic features in B(OH)3 promoted CL amination under base&#8208;free condition. Mechanistic effect on organoborane:amine stoichiometry inversion exemplified with transmetalation as rate&#8208;determining.








ABSTRACT
CuII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions based on Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) protocol have established themselves as one of most reliable and practical synthetic tools for the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;nitrogen/heteroatom bonds. Since decades this methodology has witnessed considerable development in its application scope, industrial uptake and fundamental mechanistic knowledge. Despite its successful application and popularity, the underlying mechanistic understanding remains underdeveloped and unexplored. Current theoretical investigation underpins the mechanism of CL&#8208;based amination reaction under base&#8208;free conditions employing the transmetalation by&#8208;product B(OH)3 as promoter. The rate&#8208;determining transmetalation involves an energy span of 26.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 with subsequent overall disproportionation and reductive elimination barrier of 25.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, accompanying stable intermediates in comparison to the base&#8208;mediated CL amination. The aryl migration involves a unique six&#8208;membered transition state unlike similar transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transmetalation event. The CuI&#8594;CuII oxidative regeneration is facile in the presence of B(OH)3 coordinated intermediates. The calculated results are in line with experimental kinetic studies and for the first time elucidates the mechanistic effect of inverting the organoboron: amine stoichiometry. Furthermore, Hammett studies involving substituted aryl boronic acid substrates reveals electron&#8208;rich substitution to entail lower transmetalation barrier. Overall, the boric acid stabilized copper intermediates are thermodynamically stable, allowing the amination to occur at improved time frame.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the First Generation of Glycosylated Nucleoside Analogues as Potential Inhibitors of the Base J Metabolism in Kinetoplastid Parasites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analogues of the kinetoplastid&#8208;specific DNA base J unlock a new way to target parasite epigenetic regulation. Some compounds selectively inhibit Leishmania and Trypanosoma species without harming human cells, revealing a promising route toward innovative antiparasitic therapies.








ABSTRACT
Leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are severe parasitic infections with significant impacts on veterinary and public health, particularly affecting the poorest populations. The therapeutic arsenal against these neglected tropical diseases is limited, and the emergence of resistance to available medicines complicates treatment. These kinetoplastid parasites share a unique DNA modification, that is &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucosyl&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (base J), which appears to play an essential role in parasite development and survival through an original epigenetic mechanism, allowing adaptation to environmental changes. To date, the regulatory pathway of this unique nucleobase has not been explored as a potential therapeutic target. In this work, we report the synthesis of several families of base J analogues and assess their potential against different kinetoplastid species. Some compounds have shown antiparasitic activity and no toxicity toward human primary fibroblasts, revealing promising new strategies for antiparasitic therapy.

         <title>Alkene Functionalizations via the Alkenyl Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the functionalization of nonaromatic systems via Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis (namely, the alkenyl Catellani reaction). The nonaromatic substrates include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkenes, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes. In addition, this review outlines developments in asymmetric alkenyl Catellani reactions and highlights their use in the total synthesis of structurally complex molecules.








ABSTRACT
Palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is widely regarded as an effective strategy for constructing polysubstituted arenes, providing a rapid and efficient route that is often difficult to accomplish using traditional cross&#8208;coupling methods. This review focuses on applying Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis to the functionalization of nonaromatic systems, referred to as the alkenyl Catellani reaction. The nonaromatic substrates discussed include uracil, 2&#8208;quinolone, 2&#8208;pyridone, alkene, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2&#8208;azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes.

&lt;p&gt;Palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is widely regarded as an effective strategy for constructing polysubstituted arenes, providing a rapid and efficient route that is often difficult to accomplish using traditional cross-coupling methods. This review focuses on applying Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis to the functionalization of nonaromatic systems, referred to as the alkenyl Catellani reaction. The nonaromatic substrates discussed include uracil, 2-quinolone, 2-pyridone, alkene, coumarin, chromone, glycal, and 1,2-azaborine, all of which generate a broad range of functional alkenes.

         <title>Hydrogels Formed by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Collagen&#8208;Mimetic Peptides With a Constrained Backbone Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinked collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (kinkCMPs), whose backbone is constrained by a disulfide bond, are designed to induce hydrogel formation. The kinked backbone promotes supramolecular assembly into tunable hydrogels with thermal stability depending on length. The resulting gels are also applicable as cell culture scaffolds, providing a new strategy for peptide&#8208;based biomaterials.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;assembling peptides have attracted increasing attention as building blocks for developing functional materials. Among them, collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (CMPs) represent a class of self&#8208;assembling systems. However, although short&#8208;chain CMPs spontaneously fold into thermodynamically stable triple&#8208;helical trimers, they fail to further undergo supramolecular assembly to form hydrogels. We report a new strategy for supramolecular hydrogel formation based on CMPs. The designed peptide, termed kinkCMP, features a kinked backbone introduced at the center of the sequence via adjacent disulfide bonds. The kinkCMP forms a gel, and its gel denaturation temperature can be tuned by varying the peptide chain length. Moreover, the hydrogel can be used as a cell culture scaffold. These results provide a versatile approach for constructing supramolecular hydrogels based on CMPs, expanding the design strategies for peptide&#8208;based functional materials.

2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzopyrans were synthesized highly diastereoselectively from phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides via Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael addition and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. The diastereoselectivity is controlled thermodynamically, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study provides a new synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.








ABSTRACT
Scandium triflate&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of electron&#8208;rich phenols and 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides is realized. This protocol enables the highly diastereoselective construction of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzopyrans (chromanes) via a domino Michael addition (Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation) and hemiketalization process under mild conditions. Using 2&#8208;cinnamoylpyridine 1&#8208;oxides as Michael acceptors, electron&#8208;rich phenols can be extended to methylphenols. The diastereoselectivity is mainly decided by the stability of diastereomeric products, but is impacted by steric and electronic effects. The current study expands the synthetic toolbox for benzopyran derivatives.

         <title>Metalloporphyrin Monolayers as Tunable Platforms for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline monolayers of Fe and Cu porphyrins on graphite enable nanometer&#8208;precision mapping of active sites for CO2 electroreduction. High&#8208;resolution STM reveals &#8764;1.5 nm periodicity and quantitative active site distribution. Faradaic efficiencies scale with surface composition, with Fe outperforming Cu, establishing direct structure&#8211;activity correlations at the molecular level.








ABSTRACT
While molecular electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction has advanced significantly, a key challenge persists in accurately defining the active site distribution, surface density, and structural organization of heterogenized catalysts at electrode interfaces. In this study, we address this gap by employing self&#8208;assembled monolayers of physisorbed metal porphyrins (Fe and Cu) on graphite electrodes as structurally well&#8208;defined model systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). High&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed crystalline monolayers with uniform active site distribution, offering periodicities of &#8764;1.5 nm. These monolayers exhibit moderate Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for CO production, with Fe porphyrin outperforming its Cu analogue. Isotopic labeling experiments were employed to confirm that the product CO originates from added CO2. Bicomponent monolayers comprising Fe porphyrin and catalytically inactive free&#8208;base porphyrin were fabricated to investigate composition&#8211;activity relationships. STM imaging enabled direct, quantitative assessment of surface composition, and subsequent CO2RR measurements revealed a systematic decrease in FE with increasing coverage of the catalytically inactive component. These findings demonstrate the utility of molecularly ordered porphyrin monolayers as a powerful platform for probing structure&#8211;activity relationships in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with exceptional spatial and compositional precision.

         <title>Synthesis of Peptides, Peptide Nucleic Acid Components, and other Biogenic Compounds from a Three&#8208;Component Prebiotic Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy proton irradiation of a formamide&#8211;diaminomaleonitrile&#8211;glycine system in the presence of meteorites produces a broad spectrum of biogenic compounds, including nucleobases, nucleosides, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;peptide conjugates, highlighting a chemically plausible prebiotic network.








ABSTRACT
We have explored the reactions of a three&#8208;components mixture made of formamide, diaminomaleonitrile, and glycine, with meteorites as catalysts and high&#8208;energy proton beam irradiation as the energy source, mimicking the solar wind. The resulting mixture contained a wide array of biogenic compounds, including the complete set of RNA nucleobases and nucleosides, thymine and its analogs, pterins, triazines, carboxylic acids, diketopiperazines, hydantoins, N&#8208;carboxyamino acid anhydrides, amino acids, peptides, and nucleobase&#8211;amino acid/peptide conjugates. It also embodies the possibility of synthesis stability of RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras onto which evolution to the extant molecular genetic system could start. The prebiotic worth of the system consists of the fact that formamide derives from HCN hydrolysis; glycine is a condensation product of formamide and HCN; diaminomaleonitrile is obtained from HCN. The fact that the starting mixture is three&#8208;component does not decrease the prebiotic value; it is a subset of a largely possible general universal condition: all the starting components are only the second step of facile condensation reactions. This model could be the starting point for the chemical evolution towards biological complexity.

         <title>Fluorescence Properties and Mg2+ Selectivity of Aryl&#8208;Alkynyl Derivatives of the o&#8208;Aminophenoltriacetate (APTRA) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a challenge to improve the selectivity of high&#8208;denticity ligands for Mg2+ over Ca2+. We show that in aryl&#8208;alkynyl derivatives of APTRA, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents lower the binding affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, making the ligand more selective for Mg2+. The effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen is para to alkyne, but the associated charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence is weak in water.








ABSTRACT
Ortho&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;N,N,O&#8208;triacetate (APTRA) has been widely adopted for binding and sensing Mg2+, although it binds Ca2+ more strongly. This contribution investigates APTRA derivatives that incorporate an aryl&#8208;alkynyl fluorophore, addressing how the binding affinities for Mg2+ and Ca2+ are modulated by a substituent R in the aryl ring of the fluorophore. Six such derivatives have been synthesized via their tris&#8208;ethyl esters. They feature X &#9552; CN, CF3, or OMe, as a mesomerically electron&#8208;withdrawing, inductively electron&#8208;withdrawing, or electron&#8208;donating substituent, respectively, with the alkyne either para or meta to the APTRA nitrogen. Study of the absorption and fluorescence properties of the esters reveals the importance of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states for X &#9552; CN and CF3, but not OMe. The corresponding carboxylate ligands are less emissive in water, and the fluorescence is not strongly modulated by metal ions. However, the absorption spectra change markedly, allowing dissociation constants Kd to be evaluated. The key conclusions are that (i) electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents attenuate the affinity for Ca2+ more than Mg2+, leading to a net improvement in selectivity for Mg2+, and (ii) the effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen (as opposed to phenolic oxygen) is para to&#8212;and hence directly conjugated with&#8212;the alkyne.

     alt="Fluorescence Properties and Mg2+ Selectivity of Aryl-Alkynyl Derivatives of the o-Aminophenoltriacetate (APTRA) Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenge to improve the selectivity of high-denticity ligands for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; over Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We show that in aryl-alkynyl derivatives of APTRA, electron-withdrawing substituents lower the binding affinity for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; more than Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, making the ligand more selective for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen is &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; to alkyne, but the associated charge-transfer fluorescence is weak in water.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ortho&lt;/i&gt;-aminophenol-&lt;i&gt;N,N,O&lt;/i&gt;-triacetate (APTRA) has been widely adopted for binding and sensing Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, although it binds Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; more strongly. This contribution investigates APTRA derivatives that incorporate an aryl-alkynyl fluorophore, addressing how the binding affinities for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are modulated by a substituent &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; in the aryl ring of the fluorophore. Six such derivatives have been synthesized via their &lt;i&gt;tris&lt;/i&gt;-ethyl esters. They feature &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; &#9552; CN, CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or OMe, as a mesomerically electron-withdrawing, inductively electron-withdrawing, or electron-donating substituent, respectively, with the alkyne either &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; to the APTRA nitrogen. Study of the absorption and fluorescence properties of the esters reveals the importance of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states for &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; &#9552; CN and CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but not OMe. The corresponding carboxylate ligands are less emissive in water, and the fluorescence is not strongly modulated by metal ions. However, the absorption spectra change markedly, allowing dissociation constants &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; to be evaluated. The key conclusions are that (i) electron-withdrawing substituents attenuate the affinity for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; more than Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to a net improvement in selectivity for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and (ii) the effect is larger when the APTRA nitrogen (as opposed to phenolic oxygen) is &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; to&#8212;and hence directly conjugated with&#8212;the alkyne.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox for Inducible Protein Expression With Automation&#8208;enabled Generation of Glycomimetics</title>

Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics were explored for protein expression studies. Herein, we report the automated continuous flow syntheses of the mimics and their utility in protein expression.








ABSTRACT
Inducible protein expression is a cornerstone of many aspects of industrial and molecular biotechnological processes. However, limited availability of inducible transcription factors can reduce our ability to control expression at a population level. The design and synthesis of a powerful inducer containing a fucose is demonstrated to induce protein expression through the lac operon only in cells with the ability to selectively de&#8208;fucosylate them. Batch and automated continuous&#8208;flow processes are reported for the syntheses of both 2&#8242;&#8208;fucosyl isopropyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;thiogalactopyranose (2&#8242;F&#8208;IPTG) and isobutyl&#8208;C&#8208;galactoside (2&#8242;F&#8208;IBCG) mimics. Fucosylation of the inducer allowed for fucosidase&#8208;dependent expression of a reporter protein, providing an additional layer of control over inducible gene expression.

         <title>Programmable Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles, termed PER&#8208;TCQ, was constructed through charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the electron donor (PER) and the electron acceptor (TCQ), which exhibits efficient NIR absorption. Consequently, PER&#8208;TCQ achieves effective tumor ablation via photothermal therapy.








ABSTRACT
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising tumor treatment strategy. However, developing organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with both high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple synthesis remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed the charge&#8208;transfer complex nanoparticles (termed PER&#8208;TCQ), via supramolecular assembly of perylene (PER) as the electron donor and tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) as the electron acceptor. The strong charge&#8208;transfer interaction between PER and TCQ confers PER&#8208;TCQ nanoparticles with pronounced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, PER&#8208;TCQ achieved a high PCE of 66.1%. Its effective antitumor efficacy was consistently validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating the great promise of such programmable complexes as high&#8208;performance organic PTAs.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Dependent Multilayered Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies Formed by a Xanthene&#8208;Based Dinuclear Nickel(II) Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A xanthene&#8208;based bis(saloph) dinickel(II) macrocyclic host, L2bNi2, forms cation&#8208;dependent assemblies with alkali metal ions. The complexation with Na+ afforded 2:1 and 1:1 (host/guest) complexes, whereas larger ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) yielded stable dimeric complexes, which were further converted to higher&#8208;order aggregates (2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 complexes). X&#8208;ray analyses revealed hexagonaol planar coordination for Na+ and orthogonal dimeric stacking for larger cations. DFT calculations showed that reduced host&#8211;host repulsion stabilizes 2:1 complexes for larger ions.








ABSTRACT
A planar bis(saloph) nickel(II) macrocyclic host, L2bNi2, incorporating xanthene motifs and hexyl side chains, was synthesized to provide structural rigidity and solubility. Its ion recognition behavior toward alkali metal ions was investigated by 1H NMR titration, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. With Na+, a 2:1 (host/guest) sandwich&#8208;type complex was formed at 0.5 equiv, which shifted to a monomeric 1:1 complex upon further Na+ addition. In contrast, larger alkali metal ions such as K+, Rb+, and Cs+ formed stable 2:1 (host/guest) dimeric complexes, whose sandwich structures remained intact even in the presence of excess cation, resulting in the formation of 2:2, 2:3, and 3:2 higher&#8208;order assemblies, unlike those of previously reported related macrocycles. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed a rare hexagonal planar coordination for Na+ and orthogonally stacked dimeric structures for the larger cations. Theoretical calculations support the experimental trends, showing that larger alkali metal ions favor 2:1 complexation due to reduced repulsive interactions between the metallomacrocycles. These findings demonstrate that the aggregation behavior of the metallomacrocycle is sensitively tuned by the size and coordination preferences of guest cations, highlighting the utility of preorganized, metal&#8208;based macrocycles in constructing dynamic, multivalent supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Construction of Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 Heterojunction@Cellulose Acetate Composite Material and Its Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Tetracycline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The widespread use of tetracycline (TC) has resulted in severe water pollution, highlighting the urgent need for efficient degradation technologies. In this study, a Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3/CA photocatalyst was synthesized using cellulose acetate (CA) as a carrier via a solvothermal process combined with nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation, and its photocatalytic performance in TC degradation was systematically evaluated. Under optimal conditions, a degradation efficiency of 95.06% was achieved. Both experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the formation of the Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 heterojunction enhances the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and improves visible&#8208;light absorption, whereas the incorporation of CA significantly boosts the material's recyclability. Various characterization methods confirmed the successful synthesis of Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3/CA. Additionally, the efficient carrier separation and expansion of the light absorption range achieved by the Bi&#8208;BTC/BiYO3 heterojunction were demonstrated. Notably, the photocatalyst retained 91% of its initial degradation efficiency after four recycling cycles, underscoring the potential of the CA&#8208;based composite catalyst for application in simulated wastewater treatment. This synergistic integration of a heterojunction and carrier provides a promising strategy for the effective degradation of environmental pollutants.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Azulene Conjugates: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Proton&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicene&#8208;azulene conjugates exhibit strong electronic circular dichroic responses in the azulene absorption region and reversible chiroptical switching upon protonation/deprotonation. Their weak emission obeys the Kasha rule.








ABSTRACT
The synthesis of 4,13&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;carbo[6]helicene derivatives substituted at positions 2,15 by either 2&#8208;azulene (H&#8208;2&#8208;azu) or 6&#8208;azulene (H&#8208;6&#8208;azu) units is presented. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these new helicene&#8208;azulene derivatives have been examined in details. Both helical constitutional isomers H&#8208;2&#8208;azu and H&#8208;6&#8208;azu exhibit strong electronic circular dichroic responses in the azulene absorption region and reversible chiroptical switching upon protonation/deprotonation. Furthermore, although very weak, emission was also observed and was analyzed as originating from the S1 excited state, i.e., obeying the Kasha rule, which is not common in azulene derivatives. Theoretical calculations helped confirm these observations. Finally, these systems revealed efficient chemical acid&#8208;base triggered chiroptical switching activity, showing notably a strong red shift upon protonation.

         <title>Synergizing Mechanochemistry and Multicomponent Reactions for Sustainable COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free mechanosynthetic strategy was established for constructing quinoline&#8208;linked MCR&#8208;COFs via a three&#8208;component Povarov cascade reaction, and high&#8208;crystallinity products were efficiently synthesized by milling at 15&#160;Hz for 60&#160;min. The as&#8208;prepared MCR&#8208;COFs exhibited high crystallinity, well&#8208;defined permanent porosity, and a maximum specific surface area of 1371.6 m2/g.








ABSTRACT
Mechanochemistry has emerged as a cornerstone of sustainable synthesis, providing an energy&#8208;efficient, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional solution&#8208;phase methodologies while minimizing environmental impact. Despite increasing application of mechanochemical approaches for preparing diverse organic compounds, the extension of these strategies to the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is limited up to now. Notably, the mechanochemical synthesis of multicomponent reaction&#8208;derived COFs (MCR&#8208;COFs) has not been previously reported. Herein, we demonstrate solvent&#8208;free mechanosynthesis of MCR&#8208;COFs through a three&#8208;component Povarov cascade reaction, efficiently combining aldehydes, amines, and phenylacetylenes with tert&#8208;butyl peroxybenzoate as the unique oxidant under one&#8208;pot ball&#8208;milling conditions. The resulting frameworks exhibit exceptional structural regularity, manifested by high crystallinity and well&#8208;defined permanent porosity with surface areas reaching 1371.6 m2/g. Intriguingly, the mechanosynthesized MCR&#8208;COFs exhibit a different stacking mode from the traditional solvothermal counterparts. Remarkably, these mechanosynthesized COFs can be applied to solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical reaction for the first time. This work establishes a paradigm shift in COF synthesis by merging the sustainability benefits of mechanochemistry with the accuracy of three&#8208;component cascade synthesis, while simultaneously advancing the catalytic applications of COF materials through mechanochemistry.

         <title>A Versatile Synthetic Strategy Enables the Discovery of Regioisomer&#8208;Dependent in Vivo Performance in Self&#8208;Immobilizing Hemicyanine Dyes</title>

A versatile late&#8208;stage condensation strategy enables a systematic comparative study, revealing how regioisomerism governs the in vivo performance of self&#8208;immobilizing probes.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;immobilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorogenic probes based on hemicyanine dyes show great promise for in vivo imaging due to their superior retention efficiency at target sites. However, their broader development and application have been hampered by tedious synthetic routes and insufficient understanding of how structural variations govern performance in complex biological systems. Herein, we report a versatile and efficient late&#8208;stage condensation strategy that provides easy access to a series of self&#8208;immobilizing hemicyanine dyes, enabling the first systematic comparison between 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;regioisomers. Although both probes showed strong fluorogenic responses to alkaline phosphatase in vitro, there in vivo behavior differed remarkably. Unexpectedly, the 5&#8208;substituted probe (P5) exhibited significantly lower tumor retention and imaging contrast in live mice than the 7&#8208;substituted analogue (P7). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and mechanistic studies attributed this divergence to the higher reactivity and slower formation kinetics of the quinone methide intermediate generated from P5, leading to nucleophilic attack by water and rapid diffusion from the detection site in highly dynamic in vivo environments. This study not only offers a practical synthetic route but also establishes regiochemical tuning of QM reactivity and formation kinetics as a crucial design strategy for developing imaging agents suited for in vivo applications.

         <title>Waste&#8208;To&#8208;MOF: Upcycling of Waste Polyimide into Europium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Efficient Fluorescence Sensor of Biogenic Amines</title>

We upcycle waste polyimide into Eu&#8208;MOFs, yielding porous, luminescent materials for ultrasensitive cadaverine detection and portable paper&#8208;based fluorescence sensing under UV light.








ABSTRACT
The fluorescence sensing method based on lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid, real&#8208;time detection of biogenic amines (BAs). However, their high cost, complex synthesis, and unclear sensing mechanism limit practical application. Herein, waste polyimide is utilized as a precursor to synthesize Eu&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetracarboxylic acid (Eu&#8208;BTEC) via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8211;solution method. Under optimum conditions, the obtained Eu&#8208;BTEC exhibits excellent fluorescence selectivity and sensitivity toward cadaverine, with an apparent constant of 1.58 &#215;106 L&#183;mol&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 0.17 &#181;mol&#183;L&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the amino groups of cadaverine donate electrons to Eu3+, blocking the intramolecular electron transfer from the benzene ligand to Eu3+. Owing to the absence of chromophores in cadaverine, this electron transfer leads to luminescence quenching of Eu&#8208;BTEC. To achieve visual and portable detection, Eu&#8208;BTEC&#8208;based fluorescence test strips were fabricated by spraying its suspension onto filter paper, enabling visual quantification of cadaverine (0.50 &#181;mol&#183;L&#8722;1) under UV light. This study not only provides a sustainable route for converting waste polyimide into Ln&#8208;MOFs but also elucidates the BA sensing mechanism through HOMO&#8208;LUMO band&#8208;gap and electron&#8208;density analyses, offering new insights into the fluorescence quenching process of Ln&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Formazanate Complexes as Tunable Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;formazanates were investigated as a chemically tunable and electrochemically robust class of redox&#8208;active materials for nonaqueous flow batteries. Electrochemical characterization, coupled with postmortem analysis, uncovers B&#9472;F bond cleavage as a key degradation pathway contributing to capacity fade. Through rational design, a diphenyl boron derivative was developed that exhibited superior cycling stability in a symmetrical flow cell.








ABSTRACT
As a broad&#8208;scale energy storage solution, redox flow batteries (RFBs) offer high efficiency and tunable design. However, conventional RFBs rely on transition&#8208;metal ion couples, (e.g., vanadium or iron), whose implementation is limited by low energy densities, high cost, and environmental leaching. Main&#8208;group compounds, comprising earth&#8208;abundant, p&#8208;block elements, represent highly promising, yet underexplored candidates for RFBs. Herein, we evaluate three boron&#8208;formazanate complexes as negolyte and symmetric electrolytes in nonaqueous organic redox flow batteries (NAORFBs). Detailed electrochemical characterization of these complexes reveals two sequential reduction processes with the first being exceptionally stable (&lt;3% capacity fade after charge/discharge cycling in a static H&#8208;cell for 3 days). In contrast, cycling that includes the two&#8208;electron reduced state results in rapid degradation (&gt;59% capacity fade over 2.5 days in a static H&#8208;cell), most likely due to fluoride elimination from the BF2 moiety. Guided by these insights, a B(Ph)2 unit was introduced to mitigate this degradation pathway. The elimination of labile B&#9472;F bonds as well as steric protection conferred by two phenyl groups led to improved cycling performance (&gt;85% capacity retention after charge/discharge cycling in a flow battery for 15 days). These findings guide the rational design of inexpensive main&#8208;group electrolytes for application in energy storage.

Herein, we evaluate three boron-formazanate complexes as negolyte and symmetric electrolytes in nonaqueous organic redox flow batteries (NAORFBs). Detailed electrochemical characterization of these complexes reveals two sequential reduction processes with the first being exceptionally stable (&amp;lt;3% capacity fade after charge/discharge cycling in a static H-cell for 3 days). In contrast, cycling that includes the two-electron reduced state results in rapid degradation (&amp;gt;59% capacity fade over 2.5 days in a static H-cell), most likely due to fluoride elimination from the BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moiety. Guided by these insights, a B(Ph)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit was introduced to mitigate this degradation pathway. The elimination of labile B&#9472;F bonds as well as steric protection conferred by two phenyl groups led to improved cycling performance (&amp;gt;85% capacity retention after charge/discharge cycling in a flow battery for 15 days). These findings guide the rational design of inexpensive main-group electrolytes for application in energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silent Partners in the Mill: Unveiling the Role of Additives in Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry offers a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, often enhanced by additives in a process known as additive&#8208;assisted grinding. This review discusses how various additives, including liquids, ionic solids, and advanced materials like ionic liquids and piezoelectric compounds, improve reaction efficiency, highlighting their benefits, limitations, and recent developments.








ABSTRACT
Mechanochemistry has attracted significant attention as a sustainable and efficient alternative to solution&#8208;based synthesis, offering the advantage of solvent&#8208;free conditions or the use of only minor amounts of solvent. Many established mechanochemical transformations rely on the use of additives&#8212;a strategy broadly referred to as additive&#8208;assisted grinding. The most employed additives are liquids (liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG)), ionic solids, and non&#8208;ionic additives. Additionally, ionic liquids (ionic liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (IL&#8208;AG)), piezoelectric, or mechanoluminescent materials can be used. This review provides an overview of additive&#8208;assisted organic synthetic transformations under mechanochemical conditions, highlighting the roles, advantages, and limitations of additives, as well as emerging trends from recent literature.

         <title>Orthogonal Relay Catalysis Enabling Diastereodivergent One&#8208;Pot Syntheses: Access to Enders&#8208;Type Products and Syn/Anti&#8208;selective Michael/Mannich Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stereodivergent syntheses have been developed. One is the one&#8208;pot stereoselective synthesis of C6&#8208;diastereomer of Enders&#8217; domino reaction product and the other one is a diastereodivergent one&#8208;pot asymmetric Michael/Mannich reaction for both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers. Though one isomer is synthesized using a single catalyst, its diastereomer, which is inaccessible using the similar condition, is obtained using two similar catalysts sequentially.








ABSTRACT
We report two enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent transformations based on a one&#8208;pot relay catalysis strategy. Chiral cyclohexenecarbaldehydes, diastereomeric to the products of Enders&#8217; seminal triple domino reaction, were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity using two structurally related chiral catalysts in a sequential fashion. While the anti&#8208;isomer was obtained via a one&#8208;pot Michael/Mannich reaction catalyzed by a single chiral catalyst, the complementary syn&#8208;isomer was selectively accessed through sequential addition of two distinct catalysts in a single vessel. In most cases optically pure products were obtained. This one&#8208;pot relay catalysis strategy enables access to complementary stereoisomers and represents a valuable alternative to traditional domino reactions and single&#8208;catalyst one&#8208;pot processes involving independent catalytic cycles.

         <title>Resolving a Nearly Two&#8208;Centuries&#8208;Old Mystery: On the Structural Chemistry and Physicochemical Properties of Compounds Associated With the Term Ammelide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, was solved almost 200 years after its discovery by Liebig. Moreover, three modifications of its 1:1 adduct with ammeline were structurally elucidated, consisting of layers with a honeycomb motif analogous to melamine cyanurate. Finally, ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were prepared to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.








ABSTRACT
Ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, is a simple molecular compound, which can be regarded as the double hydrolysis product of the industrially relevant compound melamine. Within this work, the first structural description of ammelide was provided almost 200 years after its discovery. This not only gave the first unambiguous evidence that ammelide's preferred tautomeric form in the solid is 6&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione, but also showed that ammelide adopts a layered structure similar to the closely related ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three modifications of the 1:1 adduct between ammeline and ammelide were elucidated, which form layers with a honeycomb motif and hexagonal voids analogous to melamine cyanurate. Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that both pure ammelide and its adduct with ammeline have exceptionally high thermal stabilities, resulting from their dense hydrogen bonding networks. Finally, the synthesis and structural characterization of the ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were carried out to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials through sensitivity measurements and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Partial Phase Transition to Construct Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterophase Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an alkali salt&#8208;assisted annealing method to precisely synthesize CoMnOx with tunable crystallinity and systematically elucidating the structure&#8208;activity dependency between crystallinity and CO2 photoreduction performance.








ABSTRACT
Amorphous/crystalline catalysts can effectively integrate the advantages of both phases, overcoming the low active site density in crystalline phases and the poor charge separation in amorphous ones. In this work, we report an alkali salt&#8208;assisted partial phase transition strategy to synthesize amorphous/crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;400 nanosheets for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CoMnOx&#8208;400 demonstrates superior CO production performance (146.09 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 93.6% selectivity), significantly outperforming amorphous CoMnOx&#8208;260 (66.65 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;500 (89.52 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Supported by systematic characterizations, we propose that the high efficiency of CoMnOx&#8208;400 is attributed to two factors: (i) the charge migration between amorphous and crystalline phases across the seamless contact interface can enhance charge separation efficiency, and (ii) the amorphous domains can provide abundant surface defective active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. This work highlights the critical role of phase engineering, particularly the construction of amorphous/crystalline structures, in advancing solar&#8208;driven catalytic applications.

         <title>Deciphering the Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphoester Bond Formation in Abiotic Conditions With Reactive Neural Network Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how phosphoester bonds, essential in biology, could form without enzymes in early Earth conditions. Using machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials, it maps reaction pathways of two phosphate forms in water. The role of solvent in assisting proton transfers is analyzed, revealing key effects with implications for prebiotic chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Phosphoester bonds are fundamental components of both small molecules and polymeric biomolecules, most notably nucleic acids. Their formation from alcohol groups and phosphate is a significant challenge for living systems, as it involves substantial free&#8208;energy barriers. These barriers, while hindering bond formation, also ensure the kinetic stability of the resulting biomolecular structures. This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA&#8208;based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non&#8208;biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study (Benayad et&#160;al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 121 e2322040121 (2024)), we demonstrated that machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be effectively trained and employed to sample the reactive pathways of the uncatalyzed reaction in water on microsecond timescales. In this work, we significantly expand upon our previous analysis to offer a detailed molecular characterization of two families of mechanisms, associative and dissociative, each associated with a variety in the order of proton exchange events. We focus on the two protonation states of phosphate prevalent under near&#8208;neutral conditions (H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ and HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$). We find that dissociative pathways are consistently lower in free&#8208;energy as compared to associative ones, and that H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ is much more reactive than HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Special attention is given to the role of the solvent, elucidating its involvement in the reaction process, as well as the contributions of proton transfer events and oxygen substitution at the phosphorus center. We conclude by proposing molecular&#8208;level explanations for the observed differences in reactivity between the two phosphate protonation states based on charge redistribution during the&#160;reaction.

     alt="Deciphering the Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphoester Bond Formation in Abiotic Conditions With Reactive Neural Network Potentials"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study explores how phosphoester bonds, essential in biology, could form without enzymes in early Earth conditions. Using machine-learned interatomic potentials, it maps reaction pathways of two phosphate forms in water. The role of solvent in assisting proton transfers is analyzed, revealing key effects with implications for prebiotic chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphoester bonds are fundamental components of both small molecules and polymeric biomolecules, most notably nucleic acids. Their formation from alcohol groups and phosphate is a significant challenge for living systems, as it involves substantial free-energy barriers. These barriers, while hindering bond formation, also ensure the kinetic stability of the resulting biomolecular structures. This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA-based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non-biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof-of-concept study (Benayad et&#160;al. &lt;i&gt;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;121&lt;/b&gt; e2322040121 (2024)), we demonstrated that machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be effectively trained and employed to sample the reactive pathways of the uncatalyzed reaction in water on microsecond timescales. In this work, we significantly expand upon our previous analysis to offer a detailed molecular characterization of two families of mechanisms, associative and dissociative, each associated with a variety in the order of proton exchange events. We focus on the two protonation states of phosphate prevalent under near-neutral conditions (H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ and HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$). We find that dissociative pathways are consistently lower in free-energy as compared to associative ones, and that H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ is much more reactive than HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Special attention is given to the role of the solvent, elucidating its involvement in the reaction process, as well as the contributions of proton transfer events and oxygen substitution at the phosphorus center.

         <title>Twisted 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Azaperopyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A synthesis of hitherto unknown 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;azaperopyrenes, twisted nitrogen&#8208;doped peropyrenes, is reported. The synthesis is based on a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated benzannulation of alkynes. Key alkyne intermediates are synthesized via two complementary routes, including a Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed, copper&#8208; and amine&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of (hetero)aryl chlorides, enabling access to both carbo&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted peropyrene frameworks. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals twisted conformations with bay and end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angles ranging between 10.0&#8211;19.9&#176; and 5.5&#8211;25.0&#176;, respectively, as well as unprecedented conformational isomorphism. The influence of regioselective single N&#8208;doping within the twisted peropyrene framework on the photophysical and electrochemical properties were elucidated by combined experimental and computational studies and compared with those of the carbon congener.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dependent DNA Binding and Cytotoxicity of Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2], the choice of the bidentate ligand A drives a different binding mode toward double&#8208;stranded DNA and is crucial for conferring cytotoxic properties to these complexes. The 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand renders Pd(II) complexes cytotoxic, whereas (1R,2R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocycloexanerenders&#160;them inactive.








ABSTRACT
In the search for alternatives to platinum anticancer drugs, palladium complexes have attracted considerable interest. In this frame, six square planar palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2] were prepared, where the ligand A is (1R,2R)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), and the ligand B is chlorine, iodine, or pyridine. The biological properties of the investigated compounds were systematically evaluated to identify trends linked to ligand variations. The complexes were synthesized following established experimental procedures and characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. DNA interactions were investigated through melting experiments and the ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay. The obtained data suggested covalent adduct formation as the preferential binding mode for the DACH&#8208;containing complexes, whereas intercalation was predominant for the phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes. Notably, at least one compound appears to interact with DNA through both modes. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated against three human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780R, and SKOV3) as well as a healthy control cell line (HSkM, human skeletal myoblasts). Significant cytotoxic activity was observed for the Phen&#8208;containing complexes, with compound 3 also showing a good selectivity index. Conversely, DACH&#8208;containing complexes were found to be non&#8208;cytotoxic.

         <title>Harnessing MOF Derived Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;CeO2 Nano Catalyst for CO2&#8208;Activated Soft Oxidation of Furfural to Furoic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
CO2 as a soft oxidant is scarcely explored in literature for furfural oxidation to furoic acid, and where CeO2, capitalizes on the synergistic effect of FLPs for enhanced CO2 reduction and furfural oxidation. This study presents a comparative analysis by the synthesis method to produce hydrothermal and MOF&#8208;derived CeO2 nanocatalyst and their effect on the formation of oxygen vacancies and metastable Ce3+ ions. The normalized surface concentration derived from XPS At% and specific surface area effectively quantifies accessible Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies, capturing FLP sites. Oxygen vacancies near surface Ce3+ sites (FLPs) critically modulated the catalytic performance, and evidenced by high turnover number (TON). FTIR adsorption study revealed that CO2 forms bidentate carbonate species and furfural, bi&#8208;coordination via &#951;2&#8208; (C, O) mode on the catalyst surface. Further active site masking strategy helped to understand and validate the crucial role of FLPs. The Central Composite Design model was utilized to optimize the reaction conditions and obtained high furfural conversion (99%) and furoic acid selectivity (99%). The catalyst was resistant to active site leaching and exhibited excellent stability, recyclability, and robustness. The findings highlight a potential pathway for the catalytic soft oxidation of furfural to furoic acid by CO2 utilization.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Phosphorus Cross&#8208;Anion Coupling on Rare&#8208;Earth Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes toward disubstituted phosphorus oxides provides a new class of seven&#8208;membered rare&#8208;earth metallacycles containing a C&#9552;P double bond. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through two steps: the activation of the P&#9472;H bond of disubstituted phosphorus oxides, and a formal reductive elimination process leading to the formation of a C&#9472;P bond. PIO analyses are applied to better understand the bonding properties and electron flow of the essential transition states.








ABSTRACT
Carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;anion coupling reaction on rare&#8208;earth center is implemented through formal reductive elimination process. Phosphine oxides with different substituents are treated to prove the universality of this method. Computational approaches are applied to confirm that the reaction generated a C&#9552;P double bond during the process, and the two&#8208;electron reductive elimination process occurs with the assistance of the butadienyl backbone. The orbital interactions of the key transition states are clarified by principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis. This work significantly expands the applicability of rare&#8208;earth metallacycles and further reveals their unique reactivity, providing a C&#9472;P coupling, azametallacycle, metallacycle, rare&#8208;earth metal novel strategy for constructing phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds.

Computational approaches are applied to confirm that the reaction generated a C&#9552;P double bond during the process, and the two-electron reductive elimination process occurs with the assistance of the butadienyl backbone. The orbital interactions of the key transition states are clarified by principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis. This work significantly expands the applicability of rare-earth metallacycles and further reveals their unique reactivity, providing a C&#9472;P coupling, azametallacycle, metallacycle, rare-earth metal novel strategy for constructing phosphorus-containing compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Preactivation of 3DPAFIPN into Highly Active Photocatalytic Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to avoid competitive radical substitution of the CN group, the pre&#8208;irradiation of 3DPAFIPN (ReAct&#8208;Light) resulted in the formation of cyclic photocatalyst derivatives PC1 and PC2. The thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reaction demonstrated greater catalytic performance and stability of the PC1/PC2 forms in comparison to the initial 3DPAFIPN and the in situ generated CN&#8208;substituted photocatalyst form (PC3).








ABSTRACT
Cyanoarene photocatalysts such as 3DPAFIPN are widely employed in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations, yet their intrinsic structural dynamics under irradiation remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that 3DPAFIPN undergoes light&#8208;induced reconfiguration into distinct cyclized and radical substitution products, with the parent species ultimately decomposing under reaction conditions. Using a combination of Photo&#8208;Chem&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and TLC&#8208;mapping, we directly monitored the evolution of catalytic forms and identified the cyclized derivatives as the true active species in thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene coupling. The major cyclized product was isolated and structurally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unambiguous experimental evidence for light&#8208;driven photocatalyst reconfiguration. Compared with the precursor, the cyclized catalysts display enhanced stability against cyanide substitution by radical intermediates and deliver higher efficiency and selectivity. This study establishes a generalizable workflow for dissecting dynamic photocatalyst behavior and extends the ReAct&#8208;Light concept, highlighting light&#8208;triggered structural evolution as a new design principle for adaptive and robust photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Functionalization of 4&#8208;Methylcoumarins: A Vinylogous Nucleophile Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective offers an in&#8208;depth summary of recent progress in catalytic asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It further outlines prospective strategies for designing efficient catalytic systems to enable new transformations, emphasizing their emerging significance and unexplored potential in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
The broad utility of coumarin scaffolds has long intrigued organic chemists, driving extensive research into their synthesis and functionalization. Over the decades, functionalized coumarins have emerged as privileged frameworks in natural products, biologically and pharmaceutically relevant molecules, as well as in dyes and advanced materials. While numerous strategies have been developed for C&#8211;H functionalization at the C&#8208;3, C&#8208;4, and C&#8208;7 positions through organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and photocatalytic methods, the pursuit of remote C&#8211;H functionalization in coumarin analogues, particularly as an alternative mode of activation that harnesses their vinylogous nucleophilicity remains both compelling and challenging. This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of recent catalytic advances in the asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It also highlights future directions for the development of efficient catalytic systems to unlock novel transformations, underscoring their untapped potential in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Flexizyme&#8208;Based Strategy for the Synthesis of Stable, Non&#8208;Isomerizable Amide&#8208;Linked 2&#8217;&#8208;Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNAs and their Shortened Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we reveal that flexizymes, engineered ribozymes known for strict 3&#8217;&#8208;regiospecific aminoacylation, unexpectedly generate the elusive 2&#8217;&#8208;amide aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA analog from 2&#8217;&#8208;amine&#8208;containing tRNA (2&#8217;&#8208;NH2&#8208;tRNA) and ester&#8208;activated amino acid (AA&#8208;DBE). A fast two&#8208;step mechanism enables efficient formation of stable 2&#8217;&#8208;amide AA&#8208;tRNAs, uncovering an unanticipated facet of flexizyme catalytic versatility.








ABSTRACT
The study of the regiospecificity of aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA (AA&#8208;tRNA)&#8208;dependent enzymes and their structural characterization with AA&#8208;tRNAs are limited by rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond linking amino acid to tRNA. To overcome this limitation, stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs bearing hydrolysis&#8208;resistant linkages, such as amide bonds or ester bioisosteres, have been developed. These analogs are valuable tools for investigating interactions between AA&#8208;tRNAs and various enzymes or ribonucleoproteins, including elongation factors, ribosomes, Fem&#8208;family transferases, and cyclodipeptide synthases. However, their synthesis remains technically challenging. Recently, flexizymes&#8212;engineered ribozymes capable of aminoacylating tRNAs with diverse amino acids or analogs&#8212;have enabled the synthesis of 3&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked AA&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs. Due to their inherent specificity for 3&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation, flexizymes have not been used to generate 2&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked analogs, and such regioisomers have remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that while flexizymes cannot directly aminoacylate the 2&#8242; position, they can nevertheless mediate the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;aminoacyl&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs via a two&#8208;step regioisomerization mechanism with excellent yields. This finding provides new insights into the binding mode of AA&#8208;tRNAs to flexizymes and expands the chemical space of stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs. Access to both 3&#8242;&#8208; and 2&#8242;&#8208;amide regioisomers will enable more precise studies of AA&#8208;tRNA recognition and catalysis by various AA&#8208;tRNA&#8208;dependent systems.

         <title>Azoheteroarene&#8208;Modified Grapiprants Serving as Photoswitchable EP4 Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the anti&#8208;inflammatory drug grapiprant by azoheteroarenes renders it a reversibly light&#8208;controllable EP4 antagonist. In vitro cell&#8208;based EP4 activity studies revealed that the cis isomer of the lead antagonist, which relatively strongly binds with the EP4 receptor involving its compact T&#8208;shaped geometry, was 1.8&#8208;fold more potent than its trans isomer.








ABSTRACT
Photopharmacology offers a novel approach to eliminate side effects of chemotherapy treatment via site&#8208;specific activation of light&#8208;active anticancer agents, which are typically constructed by the installation of light&#8208;cleavable or light&#8208;switchable molecules onto known drugs or inhibitors. The light&#8208;switchable drugs being able to reversibly control biological activities are more advantageous, but the design of such compounds is very challenging. We synthesized a small series of photoswitchable S&#8208;arylsulfonylurea&#8208;based EP4 antagonists by substituting a core structural unit of a potent EP4 antagonist, grapiprant. In vitro cell&#8208;based EP4 activity studies revealed that all light&#8208;induced cis isomers of these compounds are more potent than their trans isomers. Compound 3, with an azopyrazole photoswitch and a para&#8208;methyl substitution in the S&#8208;phenyl ring, displayed the highest EP4 antagonism by its cis isomer and a considerably larger activity difference (ca. 1.8&#8208;fold) between trans and cis photoisomers. It showed (near) complete photoisomerization (&#8764;95%&#8211;98%) upon 365&#160;nm (forward) and 520&#160;nm (reverse) light irradiations. The metastable cis isomers demonstrated high thermal stability (t1/2 = 1&#8211;3 days). All compounds were resistant to photobleaching and showed impressive stability for reduction with glutathione (10&#160;mM). This study constitutes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to design photoswitchable EP4 antagonists, and the structure&#8208;activity relationship revealed herein may help design more potent grapiprant derivatives.

         <title>Intermediate CuIIATCUN Species Reacts With Biomolecules Within Time Windows of Biological Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated that a partially coordinated intermediate species formed in a multistep reaction of the Cu(II) ion with a model peptide representing the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin exhibits remarkable lability and redox&#8208;activity, which strongly supports its physiological relevance.








ABSTRACT
The ATCUN motif is the N&#8208;terminal peptide/protein sequence Xaa&#8208;Zaa&#8208;His, bearing the N&#8208;terminal amine and Zaa &#8800; Pro, which effectively binds some transition metal ions including CuII in a square&#8208;planar geometry. This motif has attracted much attention, due to its distinctive copper binding properties and abundance in human proteome. However, the inertness and poor reactivity of CuIIATCUN complexes appear at odds with the biological reality of dynamically changing copper balance, which is maintained through redox and trans&#8208;chelation reactions. We have demonstrated a multi&#8208;step character of Cu2+ binding to ATCUN sequences, with partially coordinated intermediate species present within time windows spanning from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Based on indirect evidence and chemical analogy we previously proposed that these transient species could serve as reactive intermediates in biological copper redox and exchange reactions. Here we used double mixing stopped&#8208;flow experiments to address this issue directly for a model tetrapeptide (DAHK) representing the ATCUN motif at the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin. We found that, unlike the final 4&#8208;nitrogen coordinated (4N) square&#8208;planar complex, the transient 2N intermediate readily exchanged CuII with histidine and was rapidly reduced to CuI by glutathione. These results pave way to re&#8208;evaluation of physiological roles of ATCUN motifs.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Strategies for Generating Polymer Protocells That Mimic Cellular Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on polymeric protocells produced using a bottom&#8208;up approach. Polymer&#8208;based assemblies guarantee stability and designability by adjusting the properties of the amphiphilic copolymers used. The review covers protocell architectures, production, and their intra&#8208; and intercellular communication mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
In the last decade, the design of artificial organelles and cells has emerged as an area with far&#8208;reaching implications due to the potential that such systems have for both understanding bioprocesses in a simple and controlled manner, and for developing advanced solutions for medical applications. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing artificial organelles and cells as single compartments or compartments&#8208;in&#8208;compartments to enable the study of internal reactions. However, a major challenge in approaching natural processes is to be able to mimic complex signaling and communication pathways. In this review, we present bottom&#8208;up strategies that introduce polymer&#8208;based protocells for studying intra&#8208; and intercellular communication. Whereas intracellular communication involves in situ reactions that are triggered by an external stimulus, intercellular communication is achieved by exchange of chemical signals between two different types of protocell, the &#8220;sender&#8221; and &#8220;receiver.&#8221; By spatially segregating different molecules and nano&#8208;assemblies that serve as artificial organelles in sender and receiver protocells, respectively, various reactions have been studied, including single and cascade enzymatic reactions. Such interconnected systems, which facilitate exchange and flow of information in a close&#8208;to&#8208;nature manner, increase our insight into complex natural signaling pathways and hold promise for creation of programmable artificial cell&#8208; and tissue&#8208;like systems for tomorrow's medicine.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Guanidinate Scaffold for the Construction of Unique Zr(IV)&#8208;Li(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique heterobimetallic compounds of Zr/Li, 1 and 2, are reported. Compound 1 adopts a dimeric structure in the solid state, whereas compound 2 forms a polymeric chain, composed of repeating CpZr&#8208;BG&#8211;LiCp units. As a proof of concept, the hydroboration of nitriles was investigated: compound 2 exhibited better catalytic activity than compound 1 under neat conditions.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we report bis&#8208;guanidinate (BG)&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic lithium&#8211;zirconium organometallic compounds, revealing new dimensions of ligand&#8208;induced structural versatility. Reactions of lithiated salts of bis&#8208;guanidinates bearing 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl (XylLLi) or 2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl (DepLLi) aryl&#8208;substituents (where L&#160;= {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8211;C&#9552;N&#8211;C&#9552;(NAr)(NHAr)}; Ar&#160;= Xyl&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3 or Dep&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3) with Cp2ZrHCl (Schwartz's reagent) in benzene proceed via elimination of H2 and HCl to afford well&#8208;defined Li/Zr heterobimetallic complexes. The formation of these heterobimetallic compounds was confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C{1H}, and &#8311;Li and DOSY NMR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Structural analysis shows that the LX&#8208;type bis&#8208;guanidinate framework in LLi undergoes conversion to an unprecedented L2X3 coordination mode, wherein the ligand acts as trianionic (tritopic) toward zirconium and neutral (ditopic) toward lithium, generating two four&#8208;membered and one six&#8208;membered metallacycles. Solid&#8208;state analysis reveals pronounced structural diversity, with one complex adopting a dimeric arrangement and the other forming a zig&#8208;zag coordination polymer composed of CpZr&#8211;bis&#8208;guanidinate&#8211;LiCp units. Notably, the polymeric complex exhibits catalytic activity, showing efficient dihydroboration of nitriles under neat conditions and effective hydroboration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, carbodiimide, alkyne, and isocyanates, highlighting the catalytic relevance of polymeric BG&#8208;supported Li/Zr architecture.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Enolate Enabled Chemoselective Twofold Allylation of Alkenyl&#8208;Keto&#8208;Imines Using Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive chemoselective asymmetric allylation on imine of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;imines is developed through in situ generation of a key boron&#8208;enolate intermediate. Our previously achieved allylation&#8208;oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement sequence was utilized for the enolate formation, which was reacted with a second allylboronic acid nucleophile, giving rise to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters.








ABSTRACT
A twofold allylation strategy is developed for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters including quaternary ones. Both linear and branched&#8208;allyl moieties were incorporated using either same or different nucleophiles through successive chemoselective allylations on alkenyl&#8208;keto&#8208;imines in a single operation. Notably, in the whole reaction sequence, while the first allyl nucleophile reacts selectively on ketone, the second one reacts on imine. Control experiments and DFT calculations supported the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Antioxidant Agents: Understanding Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based materials are promising for treating diseases caused by oxidative stress. This review summarizes how their structure affects antioxidant activities, focusing on Mn valence, composition, size, and shape. It also highlights their roles in immune regulation and cellular protection against oxidative damage. Finally, challenges and perspectives on future research are provided.








ABSTRACT
Eliminating reactive oxygen species has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy for diseases related to oxidative stress, such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Manganese (Mn) is an essential component of natural antioxidant enzymes, for example, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), thus has been extensively used to design artificial antioxidants. This review provides a systematic summary of how the structural engineering of Mn&#8208;based antioxidant agents influences their SOD/CAT&#8208;like activity. Critical structural parameters, such as Mn valence states, ligand coordination, codoping with other elements, particle size, and morphology, are discussed to correlate the structure&#8212;antioxidant performance relationships. Two major biological functions, including regulating immune cell polarization and protecting cells from oxidative damage, are highlighted. Finally, challenges in this field are outlined, and our perspectives on future research are provided. It is expected that this review will provide insights for the further development of advanced Mn&#8208;based antioxidants for biomedical applications.

Critical structural parameters, such as Mn valence states, ligand coordination, codoping with other elements, particle size, and morphology, are discussed to correlate the structure&#8212;antioxidant performance relationships. Two major biological functions, including regulating immune cell polarization and protecting cells from oxidative damage, are highlighted. Finally, challenges in this field are outlined, and our perspectives on future research are provided. It is expected that this review will provide insights for the further development of advanced Mn-based antioxidants for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8722;B Sites in Molten Boron Oxide are Superior to Cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B Sites for Methane Oxidation to Formaldehyde and Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative dehydrogenation of methane over molten boron oxide involves cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B (8&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered) and B&#8722;B sites. Our comprehensive mechanistic investigation reveals that B&#8722;B site exhibits the lowest activation barrier toward CH4 to HCHO conversion. Further, QRO and IBO analyses indicate that, at the B&#8722;B site electron transfer originates form &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond, whereas in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B motifs, it arises from oxygen lone pairs within the ring.








ABSTRACT
Boron oxide (B2O3) has recently emerged as a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of methane, with remarkable selectivity for formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO) at 823 K. Since B2O3 melts at &#8764;725 K, the ODH reaction is likely to proceed in its molten state. In 2023, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations by Rousseau and co&#8208;workers revealed that molten B2O3 comprises of 8&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 4&#8208;membered cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites and a B&#8722;B site. So herein, we carried out a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation for CH4 oxidation across these structural motifs with 1O2 and 3O2. Due to the multireference character of 1O2 and its associated species, CASSCF/NEVPT2 methodology was employed. Among all motifs, the B&#8722;B site exhibits superior catalytic activity toward HCHO formation (36.6&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1), while cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites require significantly higher activation barriers (&#8764; 50 to 78&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Orbital analysis reveals that electron transfer in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites originates from oxygen lone&#8208;pair located in the ring, while at the B&#8722;B site, it originates from &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond. In addition, CO formation is thermodynamically more favorable than CO2, consistent with existing experimental observations. Overall, these mechanistic insights offer a foundation for designing efficient, metal&#8208;free methane oxidation catalysts.

         <title>Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dioxepanes for Drug&#160;Discovery: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical, and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes based on the base&#8208;promoted double alkylation of saturated heterocyclic diols with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene is developed. Physicochemical and structural characterization of the proposed ring systems through pKa and LogP measurements and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies illustrated their potential for isosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Fused and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes bearing a saturated heterocyclic amine ring are proposed as promising molecular frameworks for early drug discovery. The key step of their synthesis included double alkylation of an appropriate saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic 1,2&#8208;diol with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene. Further chemical modification of the terminal exocyclic double bond in the resulting bicyclic intermediates provided access to a series of valuable building blocks bearing common functional groups as the synthetic handles. The developed protocols demonstrated high efficiency at multigram scale. The potential of the synthesized bicyclic compounds for isosteric replacements was evaluated by physicochemical and conformational profiling, that is, pKa and LogP measurements, virtual library enumeration, and exit vector analysis based on X&#8208;ray diffraction data.

         <title>Radical Stability Paradox: Substituent Effects versus Heats of Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rethinking molecular stability: Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses show that the greater stability of tertiary over primary organic radicals is not caused by stabilizing substituent effects but by the inherent stability of the substituent.








ABSTRACT
Recently, we have shown that alkyl substituents destabilize the carbon radical center of organic radicals. However, seemingly in contradiction with this earlier finding, the series of isomeric n&#8208;butyl, s&#8208;butyl, and t&#8208;butyl radicals shows an increasingly stable (less positive) heat of formation &#8710;Hf, despite an increasing number of alkyl substituents at the radical center. Herein, we provide a solution to this apparent paradox of contradicting pictures. The crux of the matter is that &#8710;Hf not only comprises the substituent effect on the radical center but also the intrinsic stability of the substituents. Furthermore, we provide a generalizable framework for extracting the actual intrinsic substituent effects from experimental and computational data, an approach with broad applicability to radical chemistry, thermochemistry, and beyond.

         <title>Photoinduced Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of Spirocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive summary on the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization reactions over the past decade. These reactions are classified into five main categories according to the specific cyclization methods employed.








ABSTRACT
Spirocycles represent an important class of 3D skeletons that are commonly encountered in natural products and pharmaceutical agents. Owing to their remarkable properties and fine&#8208;tuning of conformational and physicochemical characteristics, the synthesis of spirocyclic motifs has been extensively investigated over the past decade. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization for the construction of spirocyclic compounds, with a focus on catalytic methods, substrate scope, and mechanistic aspects. In the conclusion of this review, the limitations and challenges within this field are highlighted, and potential future research directions are also explored.

         <title>Dual&#8208;State Photophysical Modulation via Bifurcated Hydrogen Bonding in a U&#8208;Shaped Dipyridophenazine&#8208;Cored Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Donor Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) fluorophore bearing a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine core forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with neutral donors such as sulfonamides or water. This interaction modulates both ground and excited states, enabling red&#8208;shifted emission and enhanced photoluminescence in solution and solid state.








ABSTRACT
Modulating photophysical properties via hydrogen bonding offers a powerful strategy for designing supramolecular functional materials and responsive optical systems. Here, we present a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine (DPyPHZ)&#8208;cored donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) scaffold that serves as a hydrogen&#8208;bond receptor capable of forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds, enabling simultaneous modulation of both ground and excited states. We developed an efficient synthetic route to this &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and demonstrated that its absorption and emission spectra undergo pronounced red&#8208;shifts upon 1:1 complexation with neutral hydrogen&#8208;bond donors such as sulfonamides and even water. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction stabilizes the charge&#8208;transfer excited state, leading to enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color modulation. Notably, these optical responses persist in the solid state when embedded in a polymer matrix, enabling emission color switching without fluorophore aggregation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the formation of a well&#8208;defined bifurcated hydrogen&#8208;bonding complex in the solid state.

     alt="Dual-State Photophysical Modulation via Bifurcated Hydrogen Bonding in a U-Shaped Dipyridophenazine-Cored Donor-&#960;-Acceptor-&#960;-Donor Fluorophore"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) fluorophore bearing a U-shaped dipyridophenazine core forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with neutral donors such as sulfonamides or water. This interaction modulates both ground and excited states, enabling red-shifted emission and enhanced photoluminescence in solution and solid state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulating photophysical properties via hydrogen bonding offers a powerful strategy for designing supramolecular functional materials and responsive optical systems. Here, we present a U-shaped dipyridophenazine (DPyPHZ)-cored donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) scaffold that serves as a hydrogen-bond receptor capable of forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds, enabling simultaneous modulation of both ground and excited states. We developed an efficient synthetic route to this &#960;-conjugated system, and demonstrated that its absorption and emission spectra undergo pronounced red-shifts upon 1:1 complexation with neutral hydrogen-bond donors such as sulfonamides and even water. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that the hydrogen-bonding interaction stabilizes the charge-transfer excited state, leading to enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color modulation. Notably, these optical responses persist in the solid state when embedded in a polymer matrix, enabling emission color switching without fluorophore aggregation. Single-crystal X-ray analysis confirmed the formation of a well-defined bifurcated hydrogen-bonding complex in the solid state. Comparative studies with structural analogues highlight the importance of the electron-density hotspot in DPyPHZ for selective and directional hydrogen bonding. This work introduces a supramolecular design strategy for precise dual-state photophysical control, providing a platform for environmentally responsive luminescent materials with potential in sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

One&#8208;step synthesis of complex alkyl oxystilbenin glucosides (6&#8208;47% yield) in alcoholic medium. Switching to ter&#8208;BuOH as solvent afforded &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside, with high selectivity and high yield (&gt; 90%), that can be upgraded by enzymatic esterification to alkyl &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucosides. These new compounds exhibit tunable hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and valuable antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.








ABSTRACT
Stilbenes, such as resveratrol, possess numerous biological activities desirable in various industrial sectors (e.g., pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic). However, these activities are counteracted by their low bioavailability. In order to achieve an optimal hydrophylic/lipophilic balance (HLB) and thus maximize bioavailability, alkyl glucoside dimers of resveratrol (i.e., C2 to C12 alkyl oxystilbenin diglucosides (C8&#8208;O4&#8217; linkage) and &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside (C3&#8208;C8&#8217; linkage)) were synthesized from piceid&#8212;a &#946;&#8208;glucoside of resveratrol&#8212;in one or two steps using a silver acetate&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling in various alcoholic solvents as the key step. &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside was functionalized by lauric acid using an enzyme&#8208;mediated esterification. HLB values, determined from Log P (the partition coefficient between water and octan&#8208;1&#8208;ol), were calculated for the nine synthesized compounds, revealing that four exhibited values within the range considered favorable for bioabsorption. Finally, antiradical and antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and ORAC tests, respectively, prior to anti&#8208;inflammatory testing on dermal human cells. These assays have shown very promising results with some activities overpassing that of resveratrol.

         <title>A Bifunctional Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyzes Hydroxylation and Aryl&#8208;Aryl Ether Formation in the Biosynthesis of Emestrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of emestrin J (5) to emestrin (1) by three P450 enzymes from the cluster (eme) in Emericella quadrilineata. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the 15&#8208;membered lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings, while EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring.








ABSTRACT
Emestrins, a subgroup of epipolythiodioxopiperazines, are originated from cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Phe and feature a dihydrooxepine ring. They contain typically a 15&#8208;membered lactone ring with an aryl&#8208;aryl ether linkage. Despite considerable progress in elucidating epipolythiodioxopiperazine biosynthesis, the enzymatic mechanism for the ether bond formation in emestrins remains uncharacterized. We identified a putative gene cluster (eme) in the fungus Emericella quadrilineata with three unknown P450 enzymes, EmeE, EmeR, and EmeO. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and in vitro assays proved that EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings. To the best of our knowledge, such enzymatic reactions have not been reported prior to this study.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Spin&#8208;Labeling of RNA With Short Hairpins Containing the Rigid Spin Label &#199;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of sophisticated spectroscopic probes into RNA often requires an extensive synthetic effort. To minimize that, a noncovalent spin&#8208;labeling strategy using spin&#8208;labeled hairpins has been developed. The assembly of hairpins containing the rigid spin label &#199;m with RNA duplexes was monitored by EPR spectroscopy, including PELDOR. Short complementary overhangs facilitated efficient helical stacking.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids is essential for elucidating their complex biological functions. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique to extract such information. However, its application to nucleic acids requires the incorporation of spin labels, usually nitroxides. Rigid spin labels are more informative EPR probes than flexible ones, since they offer high&#8208;precision distance measurements and can provide information about the relative orientation of spin labels. However, the synthesis and incorporation of such rigid labels is nontrivial. Here we describe a strategy in which the rigid spin label &#199;m is incorporated into a small hairpin, which in turn can be used to label several different oligonucleotides noncovalently through helical stacking. We have studied the noncovalent assembly of spin&#8208;labeled RNA hairpins with RNA duplexes by both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy, specifically pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called DEER). Our data shows that short complementary overhangs facilitate efficient helical stacking, opening the possibility of using noncovalent labeling with &#199;m&#8208;modified hairpins in conjunction with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy for structural studies of larger RNAs and RNA&#8208;protein complexes.

C4&#8208;coumarin esters enhance the torsional extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, allowing for a fluorescent color&#8208;based distinction between ester and carboxylate species during esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis.








ABSTRACT
Fluorescent sensors for esterase activity include a diverse array of compounds that utilize intramolecular charge transfer induced by the unmasking of the electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl group through esterase action. These sensors exhibit different outcomes, ranging from turn&#8208;on fluorescence to fluorescence color changes. In this work, we demonstrate the application of torsion&#8208;induced fluorescence changes in designing esterase&#8208;dependent chemosensors. We present a method for detecting esterase activity based on the torsion&#8208;induced geometrical changes between the ester and carboxylate forms of a fluorophore. Our approach shows that aligning electronic interactions between the C7 heteroatom and the C4 ester substituents within a small coumarin core stabilizes the planar geometry of the coumarin ester, leading to fluorescence emission above 570&#160;nm. Upon esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis, the coumarin exhibits a blue shift in emission to 460&#160;nm, corresponding to the carboxylate form. This shift occurs due to the nonplanar orientation of the carbonyl relative to the fluorophore. As a result, C4&#8208;coumarin ester emissions can be observed in the red fluorescence channel, while carboxylate emissions are detected in the blue/green fluorescence channels. Consequently, we introduce small, highly permeable aryl and acetoxymethyl coumarin esters as indicators of esterase activity and as tools to differentiate between live and dead cells.

         <title>Modulating the Optoelectronic Properties of Tripodal Fluorophores Through Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Peripheral Phenyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A)3 fluorophores featuring central triphenylamine donor, polarizable 2,5&#8208;divinylthiophene linker, and a broad portfolio of fluorine&#8208;based substituents show tunable (non)linear optical properties.








ABSTRACT
Fourteen novel tripodal fluorophores based on a central triphenylamine donor, electron&#8208;rich, and polarizable divinylthiophene linker, and eight different fluorine&#8208;based substituents have been designed and prepared via a straightforward four&#8208;step sequence. Altering the peripheral F&#8208;substitution has been demonstrated to largely affect their fundamental properties such as thermal robustness (210&#8211;420 &#176;C), the LUMO energies (ELUMO = &#8722;2.35 to &#8722;3.11&#160;eV), the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (&#916;E = 2.07&#8211;2.66&#160;eV), and the absorption/emission maxima (&#955;maxA/E = 442&#8211;478/521&#8211;678&#160;nm). The experimental data, corroborated by DFT calculations, further revealed twofold and tunable ICT employing both central triphenylamine and auxiliary thiophene donors, and the peripheral F&#8208;substitution either boosting or switching&#8208;off two&#8208;photon absorption activity. Whereas the &#9472;SF5 groups impart an exceptional cross&#8208;section of 1930 GM, the &#9472;COCF3 group may completely suppress the nonlinear optical response.

         <title>Systematic Comparison of Homogeneous Catalyst Recycling Strategies: Organic Solvent Nanofiltration vs. Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Multiphase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key performance metrics, including hexene conversion rates and catalyst leaching, were evaluated over extended continuous operation periods. Results demonstrated that the OSN method significantly outperformed the multiphasic system, maintaining hexene conversion at 83% after 76 h compared to a decline to 72% in the multiphasic setup after 36 h. Furthermore, catalyst leaching was substantially lower in the OSN system, at below 0.1&#160;ppm during continuous operation an order of magnitude less than the competing multiphasic approach.








ABSTRACT
This study presents a systematic comparison of two recycling strategies for molecular catalyst&#8212;multiphasic catalyst recycling and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN)&#8212;within a unified reaction system. Molecular catalyzed reactions are vital in chemical production, necessitating efficient recycling of costly catalyst metals. To facilitate a fair comparison, a versatile model reaction system was developed that allows for both monophasic and multiphasic configurations while preserving the integrity of the central hydroformylation process, converting 1&#8208;hexene and CO/H2 syngas to heptanal in both cases.

         <title>Development of tCAP(N3): Affinity Peptide&#8208;Aided, pH&#8208;Triggered Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Native IgG Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tCAP(N3) reagent, featuring a stable and self&#8208;activating precursor, enables site&#8208;specific conjugation of native IgGs. This Fc&#8208;affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO&#8208;functionalized payloads, yielding well&#8208;defined ADCs.








ABSTRACT
Direct modification of native antibodies with affinity peptides remains a significant challenge, primarily because the affinity peptide often stays bound to the antibody and blocks its interaction with key receptors. In this study, we developed tCAP(N3), a novel traceless chemical conjugation method that employs an affinity peptide. tCAP(N3) can be stored for over a year at refrigerated temperature, as it contains an active ester precursor that can be spontaneously activated under neutral conditions. When tCAP(N3) was mixed with a target native IgG, Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly was site&#8208;selectively transferred onto Lys248, yielding divalently azidated IgG that can be further modified with DBCO compounds. The resulting antibody conjugates retained Fc receptor binding and antigen recognition comparable to the parent IgG.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Based on Formate Decomposition With Bio/Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution from formate with a hybrid system of enzyme, donor&#8208;acceptor linked photocatalyst&#8208;cyclodextrin complex (Mes&#8208;Acr+&#8208;CD) and platinum nanoparticle is reported. The use of CD as a dispersant for Mes&#8208;Acr+ is a perfect strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution without deactivation of the enzyme. This work also reveals that ring size and substituents of CD could influence hydrogen production in the system significantly.








ABSTRACT
Formic acid is an attractive hydrogen carrier in terms of hydrogen capacity and safety. Focusing on hydrogen release from formic acid, the developments of catalysts with easy controllability in mild conditions have been desirable. Previous study reported a hybrid catalytic system of enzymes, photosensitizers, and metal nanoparticles for controllable hydrogen production with visible light. However, methyl viologen, which is a toxic compound, was utilized as an electron mediator from photosensitizers to metal nanoparticles. 9&#8208;Mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methyl acridinium (Mes&#8208;Acr+) is one of the promising candidates which hold a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state for the removal of methyl viologen from the hybrid system to enhance the safety and the catalytic activity. In this work, cyclodextrins (CDs) were employed to form a complex with Mes&#8208;Acr+ using supramolecular interactions such as ionic and hydrophobic interactions, which improved photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution. This supramolecular photocatalyst was finally applied to photocatalytic hydrogen production with a system of formate dehydrogenase, NAD+, Mes&#8208;Acr+, CD, and colloidal platinum nanoparticles dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidone. An ultimate yield from formate to hydrogen reached 24% at pH 6.0, indicating a rate&#8208;determining step would be electron transfer from Mes&#8208;Acr radical to Pt&#8208;PVP to reduce protons.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled to Formate Fermentation: An Electro&#8208;Bio Cascade Approach in Biocompatible Electrolytes</title>

CO2 utilization in industrial biotechnology: Rational design of a process cascade for electrochemical CO2 reduction linked with formate fermentation, supporting robust cell growth and high biomass yields.








ABSTRACT
Integration of electrochemical CO2 reduction with microbial fermentation enables conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals but poses challenges at the electrolysis&#8208;fermentation interface. The electrolyte must ensure efficient CO2 reduction while remaining compatible with microbial growth. We investigated various electrolytes for coupling CO2 electroreduction to formate with formate fermentation by Methylorubrum&#160;extorquens TK&#160;0001. Electrolyte performance was evaluated by formate production and microbial growth. A phosphate&#8208;based buffer demonstrated the best overall compatibility. Optimal microbial growth occurred at 0.1&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi, with tolerance of up to 111&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 formate. Continuous CO2 electrolysis in 1.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi produced 2.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 formate in 48 h. Formate fermentation with M.&#160;extorquens showed biomass yield of 107&#160;mg CDW gformate&#8722;1 and a growth rate of 0.10 h&#8722;1. These results highlight the crucial role of buffer composition and concentration in balancing efficient CO2 electroreduction with stable fermentation. Optimizing this electrochemical&#8211;biological interface enables direct utilization of CO2&#8208;derived formate as a substrate for sustainable microbial production, offering a promising scalable route for industrial biotechnology.

Optimal microbial growth occurred at 0.1&#160;mol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; KPi, with tolerance of up to 111&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; formate. Continuous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis in 1.0&#160;mol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; KPi produced 2.0&#160;mol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; formate in 48 h. Formate fermentation with &lt;i&gt;M.&#160;extorquens&lt;/i&gt; showed biomass yield of 107&#160;mg CDW g&lt;sub&gt;formate&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a growth rate of 0.10 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These results highlight the crucial role of buffer composition and concentration in balancing efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction with stable fermentation. Optimizing this electrochemical&#8211;biological interface enables direct utilization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived formate as a substrate for sustainable microbial production, offering a promising scalable route for industrial biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent Diarylethenes With Polar Groups: Synthesis, Spectra, and Optical Microscopy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blinking green and flashing red: photo&#8208;switchable and photo&#8208;activatable probes emitting green and red light were prepared and applied as bioconjugates in super&#8208;resolution optical microscopy.








ABSTRACT
The use of photoactivatable fluorescent diarylethenes (fDAEs) in biology&#8208;related light microscopy has been restricted by the lack of probes having freely variable structural and spectral properties. Facing these challenges, we synthesized &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fDAEs with four hydroxyl groups and a single functionality in the core structure (HO&#8208;fDAEs). HO&#8208;fDAEs emit green light; they were used for the preparation of cell&#8208;permeant mitochondrion&#8208;selective probes and bioconjugation with proteins (via a single COOH group). HO&#8208;fDAEs were combined in bio&#8208;imaging with a thiophene&#8208;substituted fDAE (Th&#8208;fDAE) possessing red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission bands of the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. Th&#8208;fDAE undergoes full on&#8208;switching with 405&#160;nm and excitation with green light (&lt; 560&#160;nm). The large Stokes shifts of HO&#8208;and Th&#8208;fDAE (80 and 110&#160;nm, respectively) and different excitation wavelengths permitted color separation in optical microscopy. Photoactivation of HO&#8208;fDAEs and transient on&#8208;off switching (blinking) of Th&#8208;fDAE made it possible to acquire two&#8208;color images of cellular structures with optical superresolution.

         <title>How Do Charge States Affect Ammonia Coordination in Superatomic Niobium Clusters?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how cluster charge states regulate ammonia coordination on superatomic niobium clusters, illustrating a superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mechanism.








ABSTRACT
Atomically precise metal clusters have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties, which make them promising for advanced materials and catalytic applications. A fundamental understanding of metal cluster&#8208;ligand interactions is crucial for developing efficient cluster&#8208;based catalysts and functional materials. In this study, we show that Nbn+ and Nbn&#8722; clusters exhibit charge&#8208;dependent reactivity with NH3, resulting in prominent coordination products including Nb7(NH3)7+, Nb7(NH3)2&#8722;, Nb8(NH3)8+, and Nb8(NH3)4&#8722;. Using DFT calculations, we uncovered the critical role of cluster charge states and Lewis&#8208;acid sites in determining reactivity and the formation of complex products. Furthermore, we elucidated the superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mode and the stability mechanism of these complexes. This study offers new insights into coordination chemistry and provides a foundation for rational design of new materials via metal cluster complexes.

         <title>Construction of Phospholipid&#8208;Like Vesicles by Aqueous Aminolysis of Acyl Thioesters With Diamino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here, we show that direct aminolysis of acyl thioesters with diamino acids in aqueous environments enables the synthesis of diacylated amino acids (DAAAs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust phospholipid&#8208;like vesicles across a broad range of pH and temperature.








ABSTRACT
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells by enzymatic diacylation of polar head groups. However, analogous nonenzymatic processes remain both challenging and limited in scope. Moreover, the restricted variety of canonical lipid head groups constrains the properties and functions of phospholipid membranes. Therefore, the development of chemical methodologies for the straightforward preparation of versatile membrane&#8208;forming building blocks is highly valuable. Here, we describe a simple strategy for the aqueous synthesis of phospholipid&#8208;like molecules via direct aminolysis between diamino acids and water&#8208;soluble acyl thioesters. In the presence of imidazole, diamino acids (i.e., diaminopropionic acid, ornithine, lysine) undergo rapid N&#8208;diacylation to yield amphiphilic diacylated amino acids (DAAAs). These amino acid&#8208;lipid conjugates spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust micron&#8208;sized vesicular structures capable of encapsulating hydrophilic cargos across a wide pH and temperature range. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;based lipids as modular, functional building blocks for generating tunable membranous systems in aqueous environments.

         <title>Dearomative Vinylation of Indoles via Multicomponent Photoredox Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Heteroarene Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Dearomative addition reactions of indoles represent a prominent strategy for the synthesis of practically valuable indolines. However, implementing this approach typically requires prefunctionalization of the indole precursor with specific groups (e.g., alkynes, alkenes, or ketones) to facilitate the subsequent cyclization&#8208;dearomatization step. In this work, we report a three&#8208;component, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;mediated dearomative vinylation of indoles that circumvents the need for preinstalling reactive fragments into the indole scaffold. The developed photoredox&#8208;catalyzed thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;heteroarene reaction employs Boc&#8208;protected indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as effective terminating agents for the radical cascade.

         <title>Asynchronous Reaction Toward Hierarchical Crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical crosslinking network structures through asynchronous reactions based on the difference in reactivity of functional groups enable the realization of topologically customizable polyurea ionogels. This Concept explores the impact of network structure on the mechanical properties, hysteresis, and multifunctionality of polymer ionogels, offering a pathway for advanced flexible iontronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Ionogels have emerged as promising materials in soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining performance and enabling diverse applications. Refining the network architectures of ionogels through chemical design is a promising strategy. This Concept article summarizes our recent progress in the design of polymeric ionogel networks. Our methodology exploits the pronounced disparity in chemical reactivity among functional groups, thereby achieving the spontaneous formation of these hyperbranched clusters through asynchronous reactions. These hyperbranched clusters spontaneously assemble via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby constructing hierarchical cross&#8208;linked polymer networks. This network design endows polyurea ionogels with high strength, exceptional toughness, low hysteresis, and fluorescence. We have summarized the applications of such ionogels in emerging fields, including flexible sensing, electroluminescent devices, and nanogenerators. Finally, the application prospects and future development directions of these materials are discussed. This network design strategy is expected to provide new insights for developing functionalized ionogels.
