         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Binuclear Copper(I) Alkynyl Complexes with Cuprophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been conceived to be promising candidates for display and lighting applications because of their multifarious structures and strong photoluminescence. Herein a string of binuclear Cu(I) complexes bearing pronounced cuprophilic interactions have been designed and synthesized. [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Ph)2] (1a) and [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;PPXZ)2] (1b) display photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 67% in doped films and solid states via TADF and exhibit reversible bicolor luminescence switching upon mechanical stimuli. Computational studies manifest that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer predominant transitions ensure a small energy splitting (&#916;EST) between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and cuprophilic interactions promote the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), favoring the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;based TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments of Nontraditional Single&#8208;Molecule Toroics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule toroics (SMTs), are defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic ground states, making them promising candidates for high&#8208;density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level has been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8208;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful to design novel SMTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(vinyl chloride) Dechlorination Catalyzed by Zirconium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic amidozirconocene catalyst is shown to dechlorinate poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) under mild conditions in the presence of triethylsilane as a hydrogen donor. PVC additives containing carbonyl functional groups (e.&#8201;g. phthalates, poly(vinyl acetate)) underwent complete hydrosilylation. A procedure is reported for the deconvolution of catalyst poisoning effects by PVC additives.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl chloride) undergoes dechlorination in the presence of triethylsilane (Et3SiH) and a catalytic amount of [Cp2Zr(NPh2)][CH3B(C6F5)3] (1&#8201;b) at 40&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, with up to 91&#8201;% efficiency. Stoichiometric reactivity studies conducted on cyclohexyl chloride as a model suggest that 1&#8201;b dechlorinates PVC by initial chloride abstraction, followed by hydride transfer to the cationic PVC chain from Et3SiH. Consumer items such as pipe fitting, vinyl disc or electric cable insulation undergo either dechlorination or hydrosilylation of the carbonyl&#8208;containing copolymer (polyvinyl acetate) or plasticizer (phthalate).

         <title>Molybdenum(0)&#8208;Tricarbonyl Complex Supported by an Azacalix&#8208;pyridine Ligand: Synthesis, Characterization, Surface Deposition and Conversion to a Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Trioxo Complex with O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of a molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an azacalixpyridine ligand. This complex can activate CO and reacts with dioxygen (O2) in solution, in the solid state and on surfaces to form a molybdenum(VI) trioxo complex which mediates O&#8208;transfer from dioxygen to external substrates.







Abstract
Adsorption of metal&#8208;organic complexes on metallic surfaces to produce well&#8208;defined single site catalysts is a novel approach combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To avoid the &#8220;surface trans&#8208;effect&#8221; a dome&#8208;shaped molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an tolylazacalix[3](2,6)pyridine ligand is synthesized. This vacuum&#8208;evaporable complex both activates CO and reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn is capable of catalytically mediating oxygen transfer. The molybdenum tricarbonyl&#8208; and trioxo complexes are investigated in the solid state, in homogeneous solution and on noble metal surfaces (Cu, Au) employing a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods.

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first of its kind electrochemical approach for the direct synthesis of alkyl alkenesulfonates using styrenes, SO2 stock solution and alcohols was developed. The reaction features the in&#8208;situ generation of a monoalkylsulfite species with subsequent radical addition to an anodically oxidized styrene substrate. The applicability of the protocol was demonstrated with a broad scope as well as a gram&#8208;scale reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81&#8201;%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on &#955;5&#8208;Phosphinine Derivatives</title>

Highly emissive blue &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are newly designed and developed. Among these, methylester&#8208;containing CO2Me&#8208;CHO exhibites very high photoluminescent quantum yield of 94&#8201;%, and external quantum efficiency of 4.18&#8201;% in OLED.







Abstract
Although &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92&#8201;%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light&#8208;emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4&#8201;% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives namely CN&#8208;COCF3 and CO2Me&#8208;CHO, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron&#8208;accepting nature of these &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4&#8201;% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;based blue OLEDs so far.

This study describes the investigation of the conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0)&#8208;tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI)&#8208;trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) in detail with different spectroscopic and analytical methods. The reaction takes place in solution, in solid state and as well on noble metal surface and is accelerated by exposure to light. The experimentally findings can be explained by DFT calculation and in sum a reaction mechanism is derived.







Abstract
The conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0) tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI) trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) is investigated in homogeneous solution and in a molecular film adsorbed on Au(111) using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical methods. These studies in particular show that the dome&#8208;shaped carbonyl complex adsorbed on the metal surface has the ability to bind and activate gaseous oxygen, overcoming the so&#8208;called surface trans&#8208;effect. Furthermore, the rate of the conversion dramatically increases by irradiation with light. This observation is explained with the help of complementary DFT calculations and attributed to two different pathways, a thermal and a photochemical one. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a molecular mechanism for the conversion of the carbonyl to the oxo complex is derived.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and Trifluoromethoxy Sulfur Pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) &#8211; Two Gaseous Sulfur(VI) Compounds with Insulating Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the great need for action to combat climate change, the replacement of the very potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as a dielectric is indispensable. The gases trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) offer better insulation properties than SF6, but are more easily degradable, which makes their use as dielectrics more environmentally friendly.







Abstract
In this work, we analyzed trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) regarding their potential use as dielectrics by investigating some of their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Both compounds show a higher breakdown voltage than SF6 with averaged relative breakdown voltages of 1.3&#177;0.2 for CF3OSO2F and 1.4&#177;0.2 for CF3OSF5 compared to SF6 with 1.0. Like the dielectric (CF3)2CFCN, both compounds decompose during the breakdown process. The decomposition products were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and GCIR methods. Furthermore, the molecular structures of both gaseous compounds CF3OSO2F and CF3OSF5 have been determined by in&#8197;situ crystallization, and their physical properties were determined as well.

         <title>Selective Manipulation of Well&#8208;Defined Trinuclear Pd(II)&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trinuclear palladium acetate undergoes selective two&#8208; or four&#8208;fold acetate exchange with tridentate donor&#8208;appended aminophenol ligands to afford well&#8208;defined Pd3 platforms. The overall structure and composition for the bisligated species depends on the ligand used. Initial follow&#8208;up ligand exchange chemistry with some of these Pd3&#8208;species underlines the structural integrity of the Pd3 core.







Abstract
Several strategies are available to design well&#8208;defined multimetallic molecular entities bearing functional ligands. Substoichiometric exchange reactions in the coordination sphere of pre&#8208;existing multinuclear precursors are relatively underexploited in this context. Palladium(II) acetate is not a mononuclear compound in the solid state but rather exists as a trimer, i.&#8201;e. [Pd3(OAc)6]. Although this material is ubiquitously used to synthesize mononuclear Pd species, it may principally also lend itself to selective exchange of some of the edge&#8208;sharing acetate units in its triangular motif, whilst keeping the overall multinuclear architecture intact. Strikingly, little is known about the controlled manipulation and substoichiometric substitution chemistry of this well&#8208;defined conglomerate. We herein conclusively demonstrate that, for the first time, the targeted exchange of two or four acetate units from the Pd3(acetate)6 platform is possible, thereby installing either one or two new tridentate ligands onto this trinuclear architecture. Follow&#8208;up exchange and substitution chemistry is available without disrupting the multimetallic nature of the core structure. New complexes 2&#8211;7 are all conclusively characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Exo&#8208;Selective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the uncommon exo&#8208;selectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, exploring strategies like using bulky structures, s&#8208;cis conformations, &#945;&#8208;substitutions, transient constraints, and thermodynamic equilibriums. The aim is to understand, predict, and guide the creation of new catalysts for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, expanding the scope of synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction stands as one of the most pivotal transformations in organic chemistry. Its efficiency, marked by the formation of two carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and up to four new stereocenters in a single step, underscores its versatility and indispensability in synthesizing natural products and pharmaceuticals. The most significant stereoselectivity feature is the &#8220;endo rule&#8221;. While this rule underpins the predictability of the stereochemical outcomes, it also underscores the challenges in achieving the opposite diastereoselectivity, making the exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions often considered outliers. This review delves into recent examples of exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, shedding light on the factors inverting the intrinsic tendency. We explore the roles of steric, electrostatic, and orbital interactions, as well as thermodynamic equilibriums in influencing exo/endo selectivity. Furthermore, we illustrate strategies to manipulate these factors, employing approaches such as bulky substituents, s&#8208;cis conformations, transient structural constraints, and innovative control physics. Through these analyses, our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to predict and design exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, paving the way for new diastereoselective catalyst systems and expanding the chemical scope of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

Its efficiency, marked by the formation of two carbon-carbon bonds and up to four new stereocenters in a single step, underscores its versatility and indispensability in synthesizing natural products and pharmaceuticals. The most significant stereoselectivity feature is the &lt;i&gt;&#8220;endo&lt;/i&gt; rule&#8221;. While this rule underpins the predictability of the stereochemical outcomes, it also underscores the challenges in achieving the opposite diastereoselectivity, making the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-Diels&#8211;Alder reactions often considered outliers. This review delves into recent examples of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, shedding light on the factors inverting the intrinsic tendency. We explore the roles of steric, electrostatic, and orbital interactions, as well as thermodynamic equilibriums in influencing &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. Furthermore, we illustrate strategies to manipulate these factors, employing approaches such as bulky substituents, &lt;i&gt;s-cis&lt;/i&gt; conformations, transient structural constraints, and innovative control physics. Through these analyses, our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to predict and design &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, paving the way for new diastereoselective catalyst systems and expanding the chemical scope of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Molybdenum Blue Structure Type: How Uranium Expands This Family of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of molybdenum polyoxometalates (POMs) has afforded large discrete nanoclusters with varied degrees of reduction such as the ~20% reduced molybdenum blues. While many heterometals have been incorporated into these clusters to afford new properties, uranium has yet to be reported. Here we report the first uranium containing molybdenum blue clusters and the unique properties exhibited by this incorporation. The uranyl ion (UO22+) directs formation of Mo72U8, a square POM comprised of two faces connected by eight edge&#8208;sharing molybdenum dimers. Mo72U8, a chiral cluster, crystallizes as a racemic mixture and, in the solid state, has a &#8216;negative&#8217; charge localized on one face of the cluster opposite the &#8216;positively&#8217; charged face of another cluster. Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo97U10, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo97U10 dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo90U10. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo90U10S4 which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo90U10S4 undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation&#8208;cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8208;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8208;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8209;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8208;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8208;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8208;Michael&#8208;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8209;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction for the synthesis of Diindolylmethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes. Classic syntheses have relied on (Lewis) acid activation of aldehydes, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive in handling. In contrast, the combination of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and subsequent organocatalytic activation of the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formed aldehydes allows the use of readily available and stable alkenes with various functional groups while avoiding acidic conditions to expand the range of available diindolylmethanes. A broad scope of diindolylmethanes was prepared in yields up to 85% demonstrates the utility of the presented method.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Capturing N&#8208;Methylbenzene Sulfonamide&#8208;Phenothiazine  Incorporating Strong Electron Acceptor Push&#8208;Pull Systems: Photochemical Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano&#8217;s condition followed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors TCBD and DCNQ with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the NIR region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated provided information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoreactor Confined and Enriched Intermediates for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the process of electroreduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, it is imperative to enhance the concentration of key intermediate species on the catalyst surface. The utilization of micro&#8208;nano reactors to achieve confinement effects has been widely observed in various catalytic reactions, yet it has seldom been employed in eCO2RR. Here, we present a novel nanoreactor composed of stacked CuS nanosheets for eCO2RR to C2+ products. In comparison to catalyst comprising of nanosheet with open space, the C&#8208;C coupling within this confined nanospace is significantly enhanced, resulting in the increase of Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2+ products to 53%. In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy reveals the confinement and enrichment of key intermediate by the nanoreactor. Our research findings demonstrate that a meticulously designed nanoreactor can elevate the selectivity of C2+ products, thereby aiding in the design of eCO2RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light&#8208;induced charge separation and directional charge transfer are cornerstones for artificial photosynthesis and the generation of solar fuels. Here, we report synthetic access to a series of noble metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on bodipy light&#8208;absorbers and redox&#8208;active quinone / anthraquinone charge storage sites. Peripheral functionalization of the quinone / anthraquinone units with alkynes primes the dyads for integration into a range of light&#8208;harvesting systems, e.g., by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions (CLICK chemistry) or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating functions such as energy harvesting and storage with actuators to create intelligent actuators has emerged as a growing trend in development. By functionalizing actuation materials, they can take on a range of capabilities including energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. We provide a detailed introduction to smart actuators equipped with these functions, covering design concepts, typical applications, and future prospects.







Abstract
Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.

         <title>Proton transfer and regulation across chemical interfaces by small&#8208;molecule assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study proton transport across a membrane mimic composed of the liquid&#8208;liquid interface between an aqueous solution and an organic solution. The proton transport across this membrane mimic can be quantified and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. We show that the interfacial proton movement is controlled by the pH of the aqueous phase and cross&#8208;membrane proton transfer rate is higher at lower pHs. We utilize proton transporters found in the electron transport chain such as ubiquinols and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol to further influence the rate of proton shuttling. The ubiquinols are effective in transporting protons across the membrane when paired with a reducing agent that activates their high rate cross&#8208;membrane proton movement. 2,4&#8208;Dinitrophenol's acts as a pH activated proton transporter only active at pH&gt;4.







Abstract
We report on measurements and control of proton gradient across interfaces of water and dichloroethane. Such interfaces are interesting as mimics of biological membranes. We use impedance spectroscopy to quantify interfacial proton gradient and identify proton transfer modes. We quantify proton movement using reciprocal of time constant (&#964;&#8722;1) acquired from electrochemical impedance modeling. We show that proton gradient across interfaces of water/dichloroethane and &#964;&#8722;1 correlate with the aqueous phase pH, changing from ca. 1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;1 to 0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7. &#964;&#8722;1 changes in the presence of proton shuttling fat&#8208;soluble molecules. Dinitrophenol acts as a pH activated proton coupler which is active at around neutral pH and inert at pH &lt;4. However, quinone type cofactors change the interfacial proton transport when activated by redox reactions with ferrocene type molecules, such as decamethyl ferrocence (DMFc). Quinone type cofactors show distinct features in their impedance response assigned to a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, different from the uncoupled proton transfer activity of dinitrophenol. The observed PCET reaction significantly changes &#964;&#8722;1. We use &#964;&#8722;1 as a proton transport descriptor. In particular, CoQ10&#8208;DMFc shows a &#964;&#8722;1 of 3.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7, indicating how small&#8208;molecule assemblies change proton availability.

         <title>Probing oxygen exchange between UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF and water using 17O solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 17O labeled terephtalic acid ligand has been used for the synthesis of 17O enriched UiO&#8208;66 compound. High&#8208;field 17O solid&#8208;state NMR experiments show an overall transfer of oxygen in the structure.







Abstract
The Zr&#8208;based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66(Zr) is widely employed owing to its good thermal and chemical stabilities. Although the long&#8208;range structure of this MOF is preserved in the presence of water during several days, little is known about the formation of defects, which cannot be detected using diffraction techniques. We apply here 17O solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy at 18.8&#8197;T to investigate the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66, through the exchange of oxygen atoms between the different sites of the MOF and water. For that purpose, we have selectively enriched in 17O isotope the carboxylate groups of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by using it with 17O&#8208;labeled terephthalic acid prepared using mechanochemistry. In the presence of water at 50&#8201;&#176;C and a following dehydration at 150&#8201;&#176;C, we observe an overall exchange of O atoms between COO&#8722; and &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three distinct oxygen sites, &#956;3&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; and COO&#8722;, of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF can be enriched in 17O isotope by post&#8208;synthetic hydrothermal treatment in the presence of 17O&#8208;enriched water. These results demonstrate the lability of Zr&#8722;O bonds and the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) with water.

The &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the alkyne triple C&#8801;C bond to Ca2+ and Yb2+ ions in the 1,8&#8208;bis(ethynyl)substituted carbazolide complexes is confirmed in the solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and in the solution by NMR spectroscopy. QTIAM analysis proves the existence of M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C) T&#8208;shaped bond pathways.







Abstract
Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R=SiMe3, n=0, M=Ca, Yb; R=Ph, n=1, M=Ca, Yb; n=0, M=Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution. According to QTAIM analysis there are 4 bond critical points (3;&#8722;1) between the metal atom and each of the triple bonds, which are connected by a strongly curved, almost T&#8208;shaped bond pathway.

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light Irradiated Mn(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylation and C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkanes with C(sp2)&#8722;H Bonds of Quinones for Alkylated Hydroxy Quinones and Parvaquone</title>

Herein, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated alkanes using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any utilization of external base, oxidant, and pre&#8208;functionalization is described. Using the presented methodology, the high&#8208;value&#8208;added compound parvaquone (a commercially available drug for treating theileriosis) and its derivatives can be directly constructed under ambient reaction conditions.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre&#8208;functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized in&#8197;situ by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat theileriosis) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear&#8208;, branched&#8208;, and cyclo&#8208;alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue&#8208;light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition was fabricated. The host dimer M1 which exhibits blue fluorescence was prepared by decorating benzo[15]crown&#8208;5 with a quinoline group. M1 can crosslink the ammonium cations&#8208;grafted polymer P1 to form a supramolecular polymer networks through host&#8208;guest recognition, accompanied by the transformation of blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor&#8208;stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The syntheses and characterizations of alkyl&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (E=P, As; R=alkyl) are presented. Together with other donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes, these compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 and their ligand properties evaluated regarding the steric and electronic nature of this class of compounds. According to the corresponding Tolman Electronic Parameters, the compounds are significantly more electron&#8208;rich than regular phosphines and their steric and electronic demands can be modified easily.







Abstract
A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E=P, As; R2=Me2, Ph2, tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One allogon hardly ever comes alone but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO2 core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O2 proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped&#8208;flow measurements.







Abstract
Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets; a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of 1D covalent organic frameworks perpendicularly on the surface of GO nanosheets, a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D design, improves the photocatalytic performance for many tandem oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Under white light irradiation, 1D COF nanorods exhibit a superior visible light activity. The improved charge transfer and desirable separation rate obtain through the junction between COR and GO sheets.







Abstract
Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicular to the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&#8722;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.

         <title>Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI&#8208;trityl dyads and triads</title>

Chromophore&#8208;radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high&#8208;spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8208;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.&#8201;g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8208;chromophore&#8208;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.

Reactions of the NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf with NaPH2 were carried out. Hereby, mixtures of isomers of the unprecedented parent hydride adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 were isolated in different ratios in favour of the latter isomer, depending on the reaction conditions. Subsequent reactions of these isomers yielded the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 as well as the cyclohexyl&#8208;like anion [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8211;.







Abstract
The syntheses of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of group 13, 14 and 15 element hydrides are reported. Salt metathesis reactions between NaPH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to mixtures of the two isomers IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 (2&#8201;b); by altering the reaction conditions an almost exclusive formation of 2&#8201;b was achieved. Attempts to purify mixtures of 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b by re&#8208;crystallization from THF afforded a salt [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;IDipp][PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2] (4) that contains the novel anionic cyclohexyl&#8208;like inorganic heterocycle [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8722;. In addition, the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;b) as even longer chain compounds were obtained from reactions of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the mechanism and energetics associated with 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b isomerization as well as their decomposition pathways.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Cd&#8208;based hybrid multifunctional compounds with dual&#8208;stable behavior in dielectric, high transition temperature and bright fluorescence were reported. Then, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), and halide framework (Cl to I) on fluorescent properties.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we designed a novel PDI&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOF as a photocatalytic molecular reactor for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of sulfur ethers to sulfoxides. High yields and excellent selectivity and recyclability were demonstrated, which provide a basis for further investigation of the mechanism of action of PDI&#8208;MOF in other photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalytic molecular reactors for varied reactions have drawn great attention. In this work, we designed a novel photoactive perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(3&#8217;,3&#8221;,5&#8217;,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl))&#8208;1,2,6,7&#8208;tetrachloroperylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid diimide (Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA) and use it to successfully synthesize a novel Zr(IV)&#8208;based MOF 1 constructed from [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters bridged by Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA ligands. Structural analysis revealed that Zr&#8208;MOF 1 manifests a 3D framework with (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topology and possesses triangular channels of ~17&#8197;&#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26&#8197;&#197; along c&#8208;axis. Moreover, the synthesized Zr&#8208;MOF 1 exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor. When Zr&#8208;MOF 1 was used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light, it could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield and selectivity. Experimental results demonstrated that the substrate sulfides could be fixed in the pores of 1 and directly transformed to the products sulfoxides in the solid state. Furthermore, the mechanism for the photocatalytic transformation was also investigated and the results revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generated by the energy transfer and electron transfer from the photoexcited Zr&#8208;MOF to oxidants were the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.

Heavy group 14&#8208;15&#8201;compounds: Various low&#8208;valent group 14&#8211;15 compounds of the type [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (M=Ge&#8722;Pb, E=As&#8722;Bi) were obtained by salt elimination reactions. The focus of these investigations is on the heavy representatives of both groups, on the structures and the reactivity.







Abstract
A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8211;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M=Ge&#8208;Pb) (I&#8211;III) (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2) and M'E(SiMe3)2 (M&#8217;=Li, E=As; M&#8217;=K, E=Sb, Bi) (IV&#8211;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8722;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M=Ge, 2E: M=Sn, 3E: M=Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8722;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8722;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8722;Se&#8722;As chain.

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. jejuni HS:4</title>

Enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides have the potential to be used as potent immunogens in vaccinations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective opening of pyranosyl epoxides has been taken advantage of to obtain a family of very challenging thiooligosaccharide antigens related to Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens very challenging. So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeeded the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;Based Rigid Donor&#8208;Acceptor TADF Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>

Four twisted D&#8208;A TADF molecules based on diindolocarbazole and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor were synthesized, characterized and utilized for photocatalytic E&#8722;Z isomerization of stilbene and C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26&#8197;eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4&#8197;ns to 31&#8197;ns) and longer delayed components (36.4&#8197;ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80&#8201;%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>
The study describes the synthesis and characterization of carbon dots. These nanomaterials can be used as fluorescent sensors. Introduced in the Fricke solution, they detect ionizing radiation by oxidizing Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions. It has high sensitivity to gamma radiation, useful as a tissue&#8208;equivalent dosimeter. Tested as radiation sensors, they showed two regions of linear response.







Abstract
This work explores the potential of carbon dots as a fluorescent probe in the determination of heavy ions and as an electrochemical biosensor. It also discusses how carbon dots can be introduced into the Fricke solution to potentially serve as an ionizing radiation sensor. The study presents a novel tissue equivalent dosimeter carbon dots&#8208;based as an ionizing radiation sensor. The methodology for the synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon Dots N&#8208;CDs and the characterization of the material are described. The results show that the N&#8208;CDs have a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and can be used as a dosimeter for radiation detection. The study also discusses the limitations and challenges of using carbon dots as a dosimeter for ionizing radiation. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of carbon dots in different fields and highlights the importance of further research in this area.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids are known to be modified by natural polyphenols via amination. This study investigates the oxidative coupling mechanisms between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles, using in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. It is shown that polyphenols with a pyrogallol substructure and an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the C4a&#8208;position are most effective. These insights can play a crucial role in drug design against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8722;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8722;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in&#8197;vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.

Various pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives can be constructed by different substitution modes and connection patterns of [2,2]PCP cores and pyrene units. Diverse structures of these compounds lead to distinctive optical properties.







Abstract
We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2,2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2,2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colours and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylene diimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence (EDIEA) is an efficient approach to bicyclic fused and bridged mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks. The method is applicable for the multigram preparation of the target compounds, which is illustrated by synthesis of over 50 building blocks on up to 150&#8197;g scale. Physicochemical and structural parameters of the title scaffolds illustrate their utility as promising benzene and cycloalkane isosteres and provide a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compound's properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.&#8201;e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign supporting electrolyte&#8208;free oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazole has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical indazolylindazolones via electrochemical reduction of aerial oxygen. Simultaneously, unsymmetrical coupling products were efficiently produced by cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between indazolone and 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives through electrochemical C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). This exogenous metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free protocol delivered a number of multi&#8208;functionalized products with high tolerance of diverse functional groups.

Abstract
In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free coupling protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective C3&#8208;thioarylation of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo). The developed procedure enables the coupling of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and hindered arylthiols, providing a series of C3&#8208;modified iminoKdo derivatives in moderate to good yields. Elucidation of active species through controlled experimental studies and time&#8208;lapse 31P NMR analysis provides insights into the reaction mechanism. We demonstrate that, following a tandem Staudinger/aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of an azido&#8208;containing keto ester, an inseparable equimolar mixture of imine/enamine is formed. The enamine then undergoes a Stork&#8208;like nucleophilic attack with the in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed disulfide reagent, resulting in the formation of the coupling products. Additionally, we describe a rarely reported acid&#8208;promoted aromatization of the C3&#8208;thioarylated iminoKdo skeleton into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates, which are reminiscent of dichotomines.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported the one&#8208;pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. A new BODIPY with helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton and intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption was developed.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1&#8201;b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>

Unfolding novel metal carbenes: Silver(III) carbene complexes with square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometries are reported. These unprecedented organosilver(III) compounds exhibit remarkable stability: In the solid state they evolve into mixed&#8208;valence Ag(I)/Ag(III) compounds only at high temperatures (&gt;185&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.

         <title>Tridentate NacNac Tames T&#8208;Shaped Nickel(I) Radical</title>

         <dc:description>
A thermally stable, T&#8208;shaped, nickel(I) radical was straightforward obtained by reduction of a tridentate nacnac nickel(II) chloride with KSi(TMS)3. The metalloradical character of the compound was demonstrated by the formation of a highly unusual nickeloxaziridine complex upon addition of TEMPO. The Ni(I) species displays a rich chemistry towards activation S&#8722;S, and Se&#8722;Se bond leading to unusual C&#8722;C coupled product as well as dihydrogen activation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to generate monomeric nickel hydride.







Abstract
The reaction of a nickel(II) chloride complex containing a tridentate &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand with a picolyl group [2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3NC(Me)CHC(Me)NH(CH2py)]Ni(II)Cl (1)] with KSi(SiMe3)3 conveniently afforded a nickel(I) radical with a T&#8208;shaped geometry (2). The compound&#8216;s metalloradical nature was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and its reaction with TEMPO, resulting in the formation of a highly unusual three&#8208;membered nickeloxaziridine complex (3). When reacted with disulfide and diselenide, the S&#8722;S and Se&#8722;Se bonds were cleaved, and a coupled product was formed through carbon atom of the pyridine&#8208;imine group. The nickel(I) radical activates dihydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to give the monomeric nickel hydride.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Sulfones Using Bis&#8208;Piperidine Sulfur Dioxide &#8211; An Underutilized Reagent for SO2 Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot sulfone preparation is reported from alkyl bromides activated by silane&#8208;mediated halogen atom transfer. In the process, a previously unutilized SO2 adduct bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide &#8211; or PIPSO &#8211; was found to be the best source of SO2 for radical capture under the reaction conditions. Alkyl and aryl sulfones were prepared as well as sulfonylated APIs.







Abstract
Sulfonyl groups are widely observed in biologically relevant molecules and consequently, SO2 capture is an increasingly attractive method to prepare these sulfonyl&#8208;containing compounds given the range of SO2&#8208;surrogates now available as alternatives to using the neat gas. This, along with the advent of photoredox catalysis, has enabled mild radical capture of SO2 to emerge as an effective route to sulfonyl compounds. Here we report a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile sulfonylation of aryl and alkyl bromides making use of a previously under&#8208;used amine&#8208;SO2 surrogate; bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide (PIPSO). A broad selection of alkyl and aryl bromides were photocatalytically converted to their corresponding sulfinates and then trapped with various electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot multistep procedure to prepare sulfones and sulfonamides.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work aims to study the aza&#8208;Darzens reaction using water as a solvent in a nanoconfined environment. This study was carried out on four different gamma&#8208;cyclodextrin systems to evaluate the reaction yield and the cis/trans ratio of the aziridines obtained. In addition, the reaction mechanism was studied using molecular dynamics and the support of mass spectrometry and DOSY experiments.







Abstract
In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric &#947;&#8208;CD such as a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco&#8208;friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.

&lt;p&gt;This work aims to study the aza-Darzens reaction using water as a solvent in a nanoconfined environment. This study was carried out on four different gamma-cyclodextrin systems to evaluate the reaction yield and the cis/trans ratio of the aziridines obtained. In addition, the reaction mechanism was studied using molecular dynamics and the support of mass spectrometry and DOSY experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three-component aza-Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of &#947;-cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric &#947;-CD such as a &#947;-cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge-like macroporous &#947;-cyclodextrin-based cryogel (GCDC), and a &#947;-cyclodextrin-based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco-friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20&#8197;hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopper exchange reactions between a rotaxane building block and diamine reagents gave dramatically different outcome in solution and in solvent&#8208;free conditions. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution but the inclusion complex is preserved under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8211;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single&#8208;ion Cu(II) centers in the three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine&#8208;tuning ability.







Abstract
With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5&#8201;%, 2&#8201;%, 1&#8201;%, and 0.1&#8201;% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][ZnII(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx=2.07, gy=2.12, and gz=2.44) in the S=1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5&#8197;ms (5&#8201;% Cu), 9.2&#8197;ms (2&#8201;% Cu), and 15&#8197;ms (1&#8201;% Cu) at 1.8&#8197;K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21&#8197;&#956;s (2&#8201;%Cu), 0.39&#8197;&#956;s (1&#8201;%Cu), and 3.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.1&#8201;%Cu) at 10&#8197;K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS=&#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50&#8197;K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the magnetic dipole interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.

Let there be rock! Like the hand of a guitarist moving all over the guitar neck when improvising a solo, the pillar[5]arene moiety of a rotaxane slides over the axle component with preferential positions and a substantial distortion. A complete understanding of such motions was achieved by detailed variable&#8208;temperature NMR investigations with the help of density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304131).

An efficient, atom&#8208;economic synthesis for a family of thio&#8208;oligosaccharides related to C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharide is facilitated by epoxide&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;thioglycosylation. Access to these thio&#8208;linked analogs, known to have enhanced metabolic stability, has the potential to boost immunogenicity, accelerating the development of a synthetic vaccine against C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4, a multi&#8208;drug&#8208;resistant pathogen ranked as a high priority by the WHO.

         <dc:description>
Multipurpose silver(III) fluoride. Access to the first silver(III) carbene complexes has been achieved by reaction of the fluoride [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] precursor with different imidazolium salts. The novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. This synthetic procedure is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303937).

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high&#8208;performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.







Abstract
The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we primarily summarized the hybridizations between four classical fluorophores, namely xanthene, cyanine, coumarin and BODIPY. We provided an overview of the connection modes between conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated hybrid fluorophores. Hybrid fluorophores have played an irreplaceable role in the fields of biological detection, diagnosis and treatment.







Abstract
Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) is a promising electrode material, which has the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability. The effective strategies (introducing active sites, constructing conjugated structures, carbon composites, etc.) for improving the conductivity and stability of COFs materials are summarized, and the current challenges and future design directions of COFs electrodes are discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The dramatically different outcome of the stopper exchange reactions performed in solution and under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions is certainly the most important finding reported in this paper.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202304131).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the group of Iwona and Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten from the University of Strasbourg (LIMA, UMR 7042, CNRS) and collaborators from the University of Carthage and the IPHC (University of Strasbourg and CNRS, UMR 7178). The image illustrates the fast motions of a pillar[5]arene subunit along the axle of a rotaxane, reminiscent of those of a guitarist's hand along the neck allowing him to use random parts of a scale with certain sweet spots when improvising a solo.

         <title>The Role of Base in Reaction Performance of Photochemical Synthesis of Thiazoles: An Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is emerging as pivotal in synthetic chemistry, offering revolutionary potential in retrosynthetic analysis, reaction conditions and reaction prediction. We have combined chemical descriptors, primarily based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, with various AI/ML tools such as Multi&#8208;Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole in photoredox reactions. Significantly, our models underscore the critical role of the molecular structure and physicochemical characteristics of the base, especially the total atomic polarizabilities, in the rate&#8208;determining steps involving cyclohexyl and phenethyl moieties of the substrate. Moreover, we validated our findings in articles through experimental studies. It showcases the power of AI/ML and quantum chemistry in shaping the future of organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Solvatochirochromism of Single Benzene Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvents influence the structure, aggregation and folding behaviors of solvatochromic compounds. Ultrasensitive solvent mediated chiroptical response is conducive to the fabrication of molecular platform for sensing and recognition, which however, remains great challenges in conceptual or applicable design. Here we report a cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents. Compared to the ratiometrically responsive systems, the chiroptical activities could be triggered or inverted depending on the substituents of chiral entities with an ultralow solvent volume fraction (&lt;1 vol%). On drop of dipolar solvents shall significantly induce the emergence or inversion of chiroptical signals in bulky phases. Based on the experimental and computational studies, the ultrasensitivity is contributed to the intimate interplay between solvents and chiral compounds that anchors the specific chiral conformation. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Monolayer Catalysts: Towards Efficient Water Splitting and Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
A viable alternative to non&#8208;renewable hydrocarbon fuels is hydrogen gas, created using a safe, environmentally friendly process like water splitting. An important role in water&#8208;splitting applications is played by the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal carbides (MXenes), graphene&#8208;derived 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. Advanced synthesis methods and characterization instruments enabled an effective application for improved electrocatalytic water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production. Enhancing active sites, modifying the phase and electronic structure, adding conductive elements like transition metals, forming heterostructures, altering the defect state, etc., can improve the catalytic activity of 2D stacked hybrid monolayer nanomaterials. The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.

         <title>Each Interruption is an Opportunity: Novel Synthetic Strategies Explored Through Interrupted Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction between azides and alkynes, known as CuAAC, has allowed for the efficient synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted 1,4&#8208;triazoles and the formation of a metallocycle intermediate. This intermediate can be used for creating new structures or generating multi&#8208;component reactions, collectively referred to as &#8220;interrupted click reactions&#8221;







Abstract
The particular and unique mechanism of the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction between azides and alkynes (CuAAC) has not only allowed for the efficient synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted 1,4&#8208;triazoles in excellent yields and under mild conditions, becoming the quintessential click reaction, but it has also enabled the straightforward formation of a metallocycle intermediate, the copper triazolyl. This, under suitable reaction conditions able to suppress its protonolysis, can be used either for the creation of new bicyclic triazolyl structures or for the generation of novel three or four&#8208;component reactions. The aim of this review is to rationalize and unify all these transformations, which are collectively referred to as &#8220;interrupted click reactions&#8221;.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Silylated Diazoalkynes: New Tools for Bioconjugation of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi&#8208;functionnal reagents bearing a Si&#8208;stabilized diazo function and a terminal alkyne can react with peptides or protein selectively at carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. A dramatic kinetic improvement of the conjugation is observed by in&#8208;situ fluoride&#8208;induced desilylation. Post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry enables a late stage flexible diversification of the alkyne moiety.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Silylated diazoalkynes are stabilized diazo compounds that can selectively react with carboxylic residues in buffered aqueous media. In&#8208;situ fluoride induced desilylation increases this reactivity, leading to a very fast reaction. Application to the selective functionalization of RNase A, followed by post&#8208;functionalization using click chemistry, is described. These new reagents expand the toolbox for native protein modification at carboxylic residues.

         <title>Toward Efficient and Stereoselective Aromatic and Dearomative Cope Rearrangements: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Aromatic &#947;&#8208;Lactone Derivatives.</title>

Fine&#8208;tuning substituents of the 1,5&#8208;hexadiene motif supported by calculations enable the stereoselective dearomative or aromatic Cope rearrangements of &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8242;&#8208;heteroaromatic lactones, overcoming the drastic thermodynamic and kinetic requirements of such reactions.







Abstract
The aromatic Cope rearrangement is an elusive transformation that has been the subject to of a limited number of investigations compared to those seemingly close analogues, namely the Cope and aromatic Claisen rearrangement. Herein we report our investigations inspired by moderate success observed in the course of pioneering works. By careful experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that key substitutions on 1,5&#8208;hexadiene scaffold allow fruitful transformations. Especially, efficient functionalisation of the heteroaromatic rings results from the aromatic Cope rearrangement, while highly stereoselective interrupted aromatic Cope rearrangements highlight the formation of chiral compounds through a dearomative process.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Twostep Chemobiocatalytic Synthesis of a Furan Amino Acid from 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemobiocatalytic tandem process toward 5&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC) was developed by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and a whole&#8208;cell catalyst in a single reaction vessel, starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and inexpensive ammonium formate. The desired product was obtained with 81&#8201;% yield. More importantly, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity.







Abstract
Recently, catalytic valorization of biomass&#8208;derived furans has received growing interest. 5&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC), a furan amino acid, holds great promise in the aeras of polymer and pharmaceutical, but its synthesis remains limited. In this work, we report a chemobiocatalytic route toward AMFC by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and recombinant Escherichia coli (named E.&#8197;coli_TAF) harboring &#969;&#8208;transaminase (TA), L&#8208;alanine dehydrogenase (L&#8208;AlaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase&#8208;TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate is converted into AMFC by E.&#8197;coli_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H2O and CO2 as by&#8208;products. The tandem process was run in a one&#8208;pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81&#8201;% yield, together with 10&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by&#8208;product. In addition, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41&#8197;g/L&#8201;h productivity and 8.6&#8197;g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan&#8208;containing amino acid.

         <title>Structural Design of 3D Current Collectors for Lithium Metal Anodes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collector can solve the nature problem of hostless for Li, suppress the growth of Li dendrites and alleviate the volume expansion during repeated cycles. This review summarizes the recent development that facilitates the use of current collectors for Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low redox potential (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) received increasing attentions. However, notorious dendrite and volume expansion during the cycling process seriously hinder the development of high energy density Li metal batteries. Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collectors for Li can fundamentally solve the intrinsic drawback of hostless for Li. Therefore, this review systematically introduces the design and synthesis engineering and the current development status of different 3D collectors in recent years (the current collectors are divided into two major parts: metal&#8208;based current collectors and carbon&#8208;based current collectors). In the end, some perspectives of the future promotion for LMA application are also presented.

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Hydridostannylene: A Masked Sn(I) Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity (including catalytic activity) of hydridostannylene (1&#8208;H2) with a variety of unsaturated (alkyne, carbonyl, azo) substrates has been reported. 1&#8208;H2 (e.&#8201;g.) undergoes dehydrogenative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with Ph2CO to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene 1&#8208;OCPh2, which readily liberates Ph2CO on exposure to H2 and regenerates 1&#8208;H2. Thus, 1&#8208;H2 behaves as a masked Sn&#8208;diradicaloid 1 that also affords 1&#8208;OCPh2 on treatment with Ph2CO.







Abstract
Herein, reactivity studies of a cyclic bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADC)SnH]2 (1&#8208;H2) (ADC=PhC{(NDipp)C}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with various unsaturated organic substrates are reported. Reactions of terminal alkynes (RC&#8801;CH) with 1&#8208;H2 afford mixed acetylide&#8208;vinyl&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;stannylenes via dehydrogenation and hydrostannylation. Treatment of 1&#8208;H2 with PhC&#8801;CCH3 gives a unique distannabarrelene via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H stannylation and hydrostannylation of the C&#8801;CCH3 moiety. 1&#8208;H2 undergoes dehydrogenative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions with diphenylacetylene, azobenzene, acetone, benzophenone, and benzaldehyde to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene derivatives. The elimination of H2 in these reactions suggests the masked&#8208;diradical property of 1&#8208;H2. In fact, these [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition products are also accessible on treatments of the Sn(I) diradicaloid [(ADC)Sn]2 (1) with appropriate reagents. All compounds have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, the catalytic activity of 1&#8208;H2 has been shown for the hydroboration of unsaturated substrates.

         <title>Continuous isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran over Ga&#8208;silicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFI framework zeolites and zeotypes enable the isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran through a heterogeneously catalysed route. Incorporating gallium instead of aluminium increases the selectivity and durability of the catalyst. This reaction is promoted by suitable acidity of the catalyst and steric confinement in the micropores.







Abstract
2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five&#8208;membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed&#8208;bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga&#8208;silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities for the continuous valorisation of bio&#8208;feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.

&lt;p&gt;MFI framework zeolites and zeotypes enable the isomerisation of 2,5-dimethylfuran to 2,4-dimethylfuran through a heterogeneously catalysed route. Incorporating gallium instead of aluminium increases the selectivity and durability of the catalyst. This reaction is promoted by suitable acidity of the catalyst and steric confinement in the micropores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,4-dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five-membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4-dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5-dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed-bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga-silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium-containing ZSM-5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities for the continuous valorisation of bio-feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination of alkenes was realized for the synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines. The Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals, which served as an ideal phosphine source for alkene diphosphination under reducing conditions.







Abstract
The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.

         <title>Molecular Dihydrogen Activation by (C5Me5)M/N (M=Rh, Ir) Transition Metal Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Reversible Proton Migration to, and Proton Abstraction from, the C5Me5 Ligand</title>

Abstract
The masked transition&#8208;metal frustrated Lewis pairs [Cp*M(&#954;3N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;L)][SbF6] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; M=Ir, 1, Rh, 2; HL=pyridinyl&#8208;amidine ligand) reversibly activate H2 under mild conditions rendering the hydrido derivatives [Cp*MH(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] observed as a mixture of the E and Z isomers at the amidine C=N bond (M=Ir, 3Z, 3E; M=Rh, 4Z, 4E). DFT calculations indicate that the formation of the E isomers follows a Grotthuss type mechanism in the presence of water. A mixture of Rh(I) isomers of formula [(Cp*H)Rh(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] (5&#8201;a&#8211;d) is obtained by reductive elimination of Cp*H from 4. The formation of 5&#8201;a&#8211;d was elucidated by means of DFT calculations. Finally, when 2 reacts with D2, the Cp* and Cp*H ligands of the resulting rhodium complexes 4 and 5, respectively, are deuterated as a result of a reversible hydrogen abstraction from the Cp* ligand and D2 activation at rhodium.

         <title>Glutathione Protects other Cellular Thiols against Oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) exhibits potent anticancer activity at submicromolar concentration in cell culture. A proposed mode of action is the production of hydroxyl radicals (HO&#8901;) upon copper coordination (CuII&#8208;Dp44mT) and thiol oxidation. The evaluation of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT reactivity with several biologically relevant thiols suggested that glutathione (GSH) could protect cysteine (Cys), free or in proteins, against oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;thiosemicarbazones have been intensively investigated for their application in cancer therapy or as antimicrobials. Copper(II)&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;thiosemicarbazone (CuII&#8208;Dp44mT) showed anticancer activity in the submicromolar concentration range in cell culture. The interaction of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT with thiols leading to their depletion or inhibition was proposed to be involved in this activity. Indeed, CuII&#8208;Dp44mT can catalyze the oxidation of thiols although with slow kinetics. The present work aims to obtain insights into the catalytic activity and selectivity of CuII&#8208;Dp44mT toward the oxidation of different biologically relevant thiols. Reduced glutathione (GSH), L&#8208;cysteine (Cys), N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC), D&#8208;penicillamine (D&#8208;Pen), and the two model proteins glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx) were investigated. CuII&#8208;Dp44mT catalyzed the oxidation of these thiols with different kinetics, with rates in the following order D&#8208;Pen&gt;Cys&#8811;NAC&gt;GSH and Trx&gt;Grx. CuII&#8208;Dp44mT was more efficient than CuII chloride for the oxidation of NAC and GSH, but not D&#8208;Pen and Cys. In mixtures of biologically relevant concentrations of GSH and either Cys, Trx, or Grx, the oxidation kinetics and spectral properties were similar to that of GSH alone, indicating that the interaction of these thiols with CuII&#8208;Dp44mT is dominated by GSH. Hence GSH could protect other thiols against potential deleterious oxidation by CuII&#8208;Dp44mT.

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited for aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and 3D&#8208;printing applications. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dyes onto common polymers is not a practical preparation technique. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400092), Y. Koyama and co&#8208;workers describe the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>In2Q2: A New Entry of 16&#8208;Membered Tetraazamacrocycle Concatenating Indole and Quinoline Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The synthetic protocol utilizing macrocyclic diamide as a pivotal precursor allowed us to access a series of In2Q2 derivatives bearing various substituents on the periphery. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting physicochemical properties were revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids are an extraordinary group of compounds, fully ionic in structure like inorganic salts but with low melting points, that resemble organic molecular solvents. Their chemical, electrochemical, and thermal stability is what draws the attention and enables their use in many applications, including electrochemical power sources. Even though they are no longer considered eco&#8208;friendly because of nonnegligible toxicity and long bioaccumulation, they can still be efficiently recovered, purified, and reused. These attributes can be harvested to enhance the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The variety of ions and cations for ILs and their influence on the final properties of the compound opens the road to tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes. Ionic liquids as plasticizers constitute a major part of gel polymer electrolytes (average of 70 wt%) and hence, they affect the fundamental properties of gel electrolytes like ionic conductivity and electrochemical window. They also improve the safety features of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Vanadium doping and external modification design of P2&#8208;type layered Mn&#8208;based oxides as competitive cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176 mA h g&#8208;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1 V range at a low current density of 17 mA g&#8208;1. At an increased current density of 850 mA g&#8208;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112 mAh g&#8208;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Flip via Subtle Electronic Perturbation in Axially Ligated Diiron(III) Porphyrin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin state switching in the metal center is a crucial phenomenon in many enzymatic reactions in biology. In the current work, the spin state transition of iron(III) from high to intermediate via an admixed state is observed upon a subtle electronic perturbations to the sulphonate moieties coordinated axially to a diiron(III)porphyrin dimer. While electron&#8208;donating substituents stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of iron, strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing groups stabilize an intermediate&#8208;spin state, whereas the moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of axial ligands resulted in an admixed state. Electronic structures have been confirmed utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, M&#246;ssbauer, magnetic, EPR, and 1H NMR spectroscopic investigations. The 1H NMR spectra are found to be characteristic of the spin state of the iron. The signals of the high and intermediate&#8208;spin complexes follow the Curie and anti&#8208;Curie temperature dependence, respectively, whereas the admixed&#8208;spin state of iron displays significant curvature of the lines in the Curie plot. An extensive DFT analysis displays a linear correlation between the Fe&#8208;O distance and the spin density over the oxygen atom, as well as the Fe&#8208;Npor distance for the complexes. Thus, a slight electronic perturbation at a far end of the diheme resulted in a large change in the electronic structures with a spin&#8208;flip.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) thin films is important for expanding their functions and applications. Herein, we first report a new kind of MOF thin film by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) dicarboxyl ligand through a liquid&#8208;phase epitaxial (LPE) layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) spraying method (named AIE surface&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks thin film, AIE&#8208;SURMOF). The obtained AIE&#8208;SURMOF Zn4O(TPE)3 (ZnTPE) has highly growth orientation and homogeneous thin film, showing strong fluorescent property. Furthermore, by loading chiral guest in the MOF pore, the formed chiral encapsulated AIE&#8208;SURMOF can clearly indicate obvious circularly polarized luminescence performance with glum of 2.4&#215;10&#8208;3. This study provides new MOF thin film and new strategy for expanding function and application of MOF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances Toward Amphidinolides C, F and U: Isolations, Synthetic Studies and Total Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphidinolides C, F, and U, including C2&#8208;C4 analogs, are highly cytotoxic marine macrolides, mainly isolated from dinoflagellates of the genus Amphidinium. All these polyketides share a 75% or more similar structure, highlighted by a macrolactone ring, at least one trans&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted&#8208;THF motif and a characteristic polyenic side chain. From their isolation and absolute configurational assignment, the total synthesis of these marine macrolides represented an intense challenge to the organic synthesis community over the last 15 years, with around 14 research groups engaged in this inspiring task. In the first part of this review, we present the different approaches to the isolation and characterization of these natural products, including the most recent analogs, which may cast doubt on the biogenetic origin of these compounds. The various synthetic approaches to the total synthesis of C, F, and U amphidinolides are presented in a second part, focusing on key reactions and/or innovative strategies. The review concludes in a third section summarizing the successful approaches leading to the total synthesis of one of the members of this amphidinolide subfamily.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Light can be used to design stimuli&#8208;responsive systems. We induce transient changes in the assembly of a low molecular weight gelator solution using a merocyanine photoacid. Through our approach, reversible viscosity changes can be achieved via irradiation, delivering systems where flow can be controlled non&#8208;invasively on demand.</dc:description>

         <title>From Stilbenes to carbo&#8208;Stilbenes: an Encouraging Prospect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beyond previously described carbo&#8208;naphthalene and carbo&#8208;biphenyl, a novel type of bis&#8208;carbo&#8208;benzenic molecules is envisaged from the stilbene parent. The synthesis, structure, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of two such carbo&#8208;stilbenes are described at complementary experimental and computational DFT levels. In the selected targets, the bare skeletal carbo&#8208;mer of carbo&#8208;stilbene is decorated by 8 or 10 phenyl groups, 0 or 2 tert&#8208;butyl groups, and 2 n&#8208;octyl chains, the later substituents being introduced to compensate anticipated solubility issues. As in the parent stilbene series, isomers of the phenylated carbo&#8208;stilbenes are characterized. The cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers are formed in almost equal amounts and could not be separated by either chromatography or crystallization. Nevertheless, due to a slow interconversion at the NMR time scale (up to 55&#176;C) the 1H NMR signals of both isomers of the two carbo&#8208;stilbenes could be tentatively assigned. The calculated structure of the cis&#8208;isomer exhibits a helical shape, consistent with the observed magnetic shielding of phenyl p&#8208;CH nuclei residing inside the shielding cone of the facing C18 ring. Spectroscopical, electrochemical and DFT calculations lead to the right characterization of the importance of the isomers and their substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected nucleotides as building blocks for enzymatic de novo RNA synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Besides being a key player in numerous, fundamental biological process, RNA also represents a versatile platform for the creation of therapeutic agents and efficient vaccines. The production of RNA oligonucleotides, especially those decorated with chemical modifications, cannot meet the exponential demand. Due to the inherent limits of solid&#8208;phase synthesis and in vitro transcription, alternative, biocatalytic approaches are in dire need to facilitate the production of RNA oligonucleotides. Here, we present a first step towards the controlled enzymatic synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. We have explored the possibility of a simple protection step of the vicinal cis&#8208;diol moiety to temporarily block ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotides protected with acetals, particularly 2',3'&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene, are well&#8208;tolerated by the template&#8208;independent RNA polymerase PUP (polyU polymerase) and highly efficient coupling reactions can be achieved within minutes &#8211; an important feature for the development of enzymatic de novo synthesis protocols. Even though purines are not equally well&#8208;tolerated, these findings clearly demonstrate the possibility of using cis&#8208;diol&#8208;protected ribonucleotides combined with template&#8208;independent polymerases for the stepwise construction of RNA oligonucleotides.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating &#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction simultaneously forges carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;halogen bonds. However, frequently&#8208;used photosensitizers such as precious transition metal complexes, or organic dyes have limitations in terms of their potential toxicity and recyclability. Three &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediamines with variable transient photocurrent and photocatalytic activity have been prepared. A COF bearing electron&#8208;deficient Cl atoms displayed the highest photocatalytic activity toward the ATRA reaction of polyhalogenated alkanes to give halogenated olefins under visible light at room temperature. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibited good functional group tolerance and could be recycled without significant loss of activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea&#8208;comprising single core diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives: exploring the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from non&#8208;covalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems.
This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>NiCo&#8208;LDH coupled with 2D ZIF&#8208;derived Co nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet arrays&#160;as a self&#8208;supporting electrocatalyst for detection of formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self&#8208;supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core&#8208;shell heterostructure was prepared in situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8208;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8208;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo&#8208;LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo&#8208;LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo&#8208;LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8208;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1 &#956;M to 13 mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82 nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organocatalytic Highly Enantioselective Stereospecific Synthesis of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dihydroisobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Rich Heterocycles Derived from a Phosphadiazonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles that pair main group elements and nitrogen are extremely important within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials research community. Compared to the vast number of boron&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, those that include phosphorus are less common. Furthermore, the use of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen triple bonds of any type to prepare such compounds is unprecedented. Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>On Haptotropic Rearrangements of Diphosphene and Diarsene Ligands in Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#951;2 to &#951;1 rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp2Ti(Pn2Ar2) (Pn = P, As; Ar&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;Me3&#8208;C6H2, Mes; 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, Dip; 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L = MeCN, PMe3, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &#951;2 to &#951;1 and complexes of the general form Cp2Ti(L)(Pn2Ar2) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (via a &#960;&#8208;bond) [Cp2TiIII]&#8226;+ and [Pn2Ar2]&#8226;&#8722; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co&#8208;ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe3/MeCN (&#963;&#8208;donors) to CNAd/CO (&#963;&#8208;donors/&#960;&#8208;acceptors).</dc:description>

         <title>Empowering Protein Engineering through Recombination of Beneficial Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review underscores the pivotal role of beneficial substitution recombination in customizing protein functionalities, showcasing diverse experimental and computational methodologies across a broad spectrum of case studies.







Abstract
Directed evolution stands as a seminal technology for generating novel protein functionalities, a cornerstone in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Today, with the development of various mutagenesis methods and advanced analytical machines, the challenge of diversity generation and high&#8208;throughput screening platforms is largely solved, and one of the remaining challenges is: how to empower the potential of single beneficial substitutions with recombination to achieve the epistatic effect. This review overviews experimental and computer&#8208;assisted recombination methods in protein engineering campaigns. In addition, integrated and machine learning&#8208;guided strategies were highlighted to discuss how these recombination approaches contribute to generating the screening library with better diversity, coverage, and size. A decision tree was finally summarized to guide the further selection of proper recombination strategies in practice, which was beneficial for accelerating protein engineering.

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a sustainable, solid&#8208;phase catalyst for fast and efficient oxidation of a wide range of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls in continuous flow! The new approach enables successful oxidation of various alcohols, including previously unreactive primary alcohols, with minimal catalyst loadings and rapid product accessibility.







Abstract
One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.

Partial substitution gives the heteroleptic cations [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]+[WCA]&#8722; (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F, mes*). These salts have been characterized by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR and XRD analysis as well as computational methods.







Abstract
Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8901;+ (arene=1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8901;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.&#8201;e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8901;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8722;)2 (arene=1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Sensors for Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing of benzene vapor is a hot spot due to the volatile drastic carcinogen even at trace concentration. However, achieving convenient and rapid detection is still a challenge. As a sort of functional porous materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as detection sensors by adsorbing benzene vapor and converting it into other signals (fluorescence intensity/wavelength,&#160;chemiresistive, weight or color, etc.). Supramolecular interaction between benzene molecules and the host framework, aperture size/shape and structural flexibility are influential factors in the performance of MOF&#8208;based sensors. Therefore, enhancing the host&#8208;guest interactions between the host framework and benzene molecules, or regulating the diffusion rate of benzene molecules by changing the aperture size/shape and flexibility of the host framework&#160;to enhance the detection signal are effective strategies for constructing MOF&#8208;based sensors. This concept highlights several types of MOF&#8208;based sensors for the detection of benzene vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry: A direct and mild photochemical synthesis of lactones, cyclopropanes and ATRA products, utilizing sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid as the halogen/hydrogen bonding mediator and irradiation at 370&#8197;nm, 390&#8197;nm or 427&#8197;nm LED as the irradiation source. A variety of iodo&#8208;reagents were activated via halogen or hydrogen bonding and reacted successfully with a number of alkenes without the use of an external photocatalyst, leading to products in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.

         <title>Synthesis of [1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes through Iodine&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method has been developed for [1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs), which are attracting a great deal of attention as organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The advantage of the method is its simplicity, namely, heating readily available 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur in the presence of molecular iodine. Iodine plays a very important role in the reaction, as discussed in the proposed reaction pathways.







Abstract
[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8722;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]Benzothieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high-performance organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2-arylbenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8722;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Keto&#8208;Sulfoxides from Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfoxides were obtained in a simple procedure from sulfoxonium ylides, in a different reaction mode from the classical behaviour (geminal addition of a nucleophile and electrophile, followed by sulfoxide extrusion. Experimental studies give insight to the mechanism of the reaction, with a change in the RDS according with ylide substitution. Sulfur&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing organic compounds are quite attractive and important in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8211;80&#8201;% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.

         <title>(Diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine Oxide &#8211; A Diazoalkane Reagent for [3+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A safe and efficient method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide &#8211; a hereto unexplored diazoalkane reagent &#8211; is developed. The method is based on the diazotization of the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted amine (readily available in multigram quantities) in non&#8208;aqueous media. The protocol provides the target product as ca. 1.5 M CHCl3 solution which is stable at &#8211;18 &#176;C. The utility of the synthesized diazoalkane is illustrated by&#160;its [3+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines with moderate to good efficiency. In this view, the title compound represents and an important extension of medicinally relevant phosphine oxide reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Matere Bonds in Pertechnetate Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript we evaluate the X&#8208;ray structure of five new pertechnetate derivatives of general formula [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn (compounds 1&#8211;5) and one perrhenate compound Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 (6). In these complexes the metal center exhibits an octahedral coordination with the pertechnetate units as axial ligands. All compounds exhibit the formation of directional Tc&#183;&#183;&#183;O Matere bonds (MaBs) that propagate the [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], into 1D supramolecular polymers in the solid state. Such 1D polymers are linked, generating 2D layers, by combining additional MaBs and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Such concurrent motifs have been analyzed theoretically, suggesting the noncovalent &#963;&#8208;hole nature of the MaBs. The interaction energies range from weak (~ &#8211;2 kcal/mol) for the MaBs to strong (~ &#8211;30 kcal/mol) for the MaB + HB assemblies, where HB dominates. In case of M = Zn, the corresponding perrhenate Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 complex, has been also synthesized for comparison purposes, resulting in the formation of an isostructural X&#8208;ray structure, corroborating the structure&#8208;directing role of Matere bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting of G&#8211;quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main goal of this work was to elucidate the potential relevance of (radio)metal chelates of 99mTc and Re targeting G&#8208;quadruplex structures for the design of new tools for cancer theranostics. 99mTc provides the complexes with the ability to perform single&#8208;photon&#8208;emission computed tomography imaging studies, while the Re complexes should act as anticancer agents upon interaction with specific G4 DNA or RNA structures present in tumor tissues. Towards this goal, we have developed isostructural 99mTc(I) and Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes anchored by a pyrazolyl&#8208;diamine (Pz) chelator carrying a pendant pyridostatin (PDS) fragment as the G4&#8208;binding motif. The interaction of the PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) complex with different G4&#8208;forming oligonucleotides was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET&#8208;melting assays. The results showed that the Re complex retained the ability to bind and stabilize G4&#8208;structures from different DNA or RNA sequences, namely those present on the SRC proto&#8208;oncogene and telomeric RNA (TERRA sequence). PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) showed low to moderate cytotoxicity in PC3 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines, as typically observed for G4&#8208;binders. Biodistribution studies of the congener PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;99mTc (12) in normal mice showed that the complex undergoes a fast blood clearance with a predominant hepatobiliary excretion, pointing also for a high in vitro stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogenous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2x2 mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA-approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low-throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow-bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch-mode production of proton-hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogenous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1-liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub-second 2D MRI with up to 2x2 mm2 in-plane resolution using a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Reaction of [CuH(PPh3)]6 with 1 equiv of Tl(OTf) results in formation of [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf] ([1]OTf]), which can be isolated in good yields. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the presence of a rare Tl&#8211;H orbital interaction. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands of [1]+ includes 7.7 ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the heavy Tl atom. This study provides valuable new insights into a rare class of metal hydrides, given that [1][OTf] is only the third isolable species reported to contain a Tl&#8211;H interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic Enolates for the Construction of Quaternary and Tetrasubstituted Stereogenic Centres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the catalytic asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, as a means of accessing congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres. In particular, strategies for the stereocontrolled access to acyclic enolate nucleophiles, as well as the impact of enolate geometry on the stereochemical outcome of allylic alkylation, are highlighted.







Abstract
To facilitate the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, the demand for novel stereofunctionalised building blocks has never been greater. Whilst molecules bearing quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres are ideally suited to explore untapped areas of chemical space, the asymmetric construction ofsterically congested carbon centres remains a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. The enantioselective assembly of acyclic stereogenic centres is even more demanding due to the need to restrict a much wider range of geometries and conformations of the intermediates involved. In this context, the catalytic asymmetric allylicalkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, has become an indispensable tool to access a range of linear&#945;&#8208;quaternary and&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbonyl compounds. However, unlike the AAA of cyclic enolates with a fixed enolate geometry, to achieve high levels of stereocontrol in the AAA of acyclic enolates, the stereoselectivity of enolisation must be considered. The aim of this review is to offer acomprehensivediscussion of catalytic AAA reactions of acyclic prochiral enolates and their analogues to generate congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted chiral centres using metal, non&#8208;metal and dual catalysis, with particular focus given to the control of enolate geometry and its impact on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

         <title>Stability of the protactinium(V) mono&#8208;oxo cation probed by first&#8208;principle calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protactinium (Z=91) deviates from the neighboring actinides by forming PaO3+ in solution instead of PaO2+. Complex stability, evaluated through Gibbs free energy, favors PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, but not with OH&#8722;, F&#8722; and C2O42&#8722;. QTAIM and NBO analyses reveal a triple bond in Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond, with increased covalency Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; providing insights into protactinium's unique chemical behavior.







Abstract
This study explores the distinctive behavior of protactinium (Z=91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO2+ in aqueous phase. Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+. Employing first&#8208;principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) and Pa(OH)4(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O)&#8594;Pa(OH)4(X), we find that the PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) complex is stabilized with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, and SO42&#8722; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&#8722;, F&#8722;, and C2O42&#8722; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. These findings elucidate protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we confirmed the influence of oxidative byproducts of Li3YCl6 on its reduction potential and investigates its redox mechanism. Through combined characterization techniques and electrochemical measurements, it was discovered that when the cathode voltage surpassed the oxidation voltage of the electrolyte or in the presence of an exotic element&#8208;induced condition, the electrolyte underwent oxidation of the halide element, resulting in the absence of ligands. Simultaneously, such process generated LixYCl3+x with a distinct reduction potential compared to pristine Li3YCl6. The Y element within LixYCl3+x experienced reduction to a lower valence state during the discharge process. Consequently, such structural change led to a significant rise in interfacial impedance and a decline in the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, through this study, we analyse ten recognized TADF&#8208;active configurations using TD&#8208;DFT and Multiwfn. It validates El Sayed&#8242;s rule and visualizes charge transfer dynamics, exploring diverse sulfur oxidation states and phenothiazine substitutions to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds. Insights into rISC rates and dihedral angles contribute to a comprehensive understanding, guiding phenothiazine material design for experimentalists.







Abstract
This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach not only validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to &#916;EST values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules. By integrating rigorous computational analysis with practical implications, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.

         <title>C&#8722;F Bond Insertion: An Emerging Strategy for Constructing Fluorinated Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions are powerful methods for preparing fluorinated molecules, however their development has been severely hampered by the challenge of activating strong C&#8722;F bonds without sequestering the released fluoride. Recently, several strategies have emerged that allow for C&#8722;F insertion of a range of fluorinated substrates. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key underlying concepts.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions, where an organic fragment formally inserts into a carbon&#8211;fluorine bond in a substrate, are highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, methods to prepare valuable fluorinated molecules. The inherent strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the resulting need for a large thermodynamic driving force to initiate C&#8722;F cleavage often leads to sequestering of the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. Recently, however, several groups have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, opening up the study of C&#8722;F insertion as an efficient and highly atom&#8208;economical approach to prepare fluorinated compounds. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key conceptual advances that allowed for both C&#8722;F bond cleavage and subsequent incorporation of the released fluoride into the product.

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn(I) amido complex with a tridentate P,N,N ligand, which is easily synthesized from commercially available chemicals, is a remarkable efficient (pre)catalyst for the hydrophosphination of alkenes using secondary and primary aryl and alkyl phosphines and even PH3 as reagents.







Abstract
A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. After deprotonation of the NH group in the cationic complex unit, a neutral Mn(I) amido complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2) is formed under loss of CO. Rearrangement of L&#8208;H leads to a trigonal bipyramidal structure in which the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 results in a dep&#8208;blue anionic complex fragment [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; (3). DFT calculations and a QTAIM analysis show that the amido complex&#8197;2 contains a Mn&#8208;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins. But the catalytic activity is low. However, the neutral amido complex&#8197;2 is an excellent catalyst and with loadings as low as 0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols and naphthols are dearomatized to methoxycyclohexadienones under simple and robust electrochemical conditions, in a green way without chemical oxidants. The mechanism of the reaction is established using density functional theory calculations, which also explain the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity for differently&#8208;substituted substrates.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only products resulting from [4+2] cycloaddition pathways were observed in the reactions of different isocyanates with aliphatic imines. The alternative [2+2] pathway is strongly disfavored, and the corresponding diazetidinone products were not observed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only products resulting from [4+2] cycloaddition pathways&lt;/b&gt; were observed in the reactions of different isocyanates with aliphatic imines. The alternative [2+2] pathway is strongly disfavored, and the corresponding diazetidinone products were not observed. For imines incorporating a specifically located thioester group, acyl isocyanates and aryl isocyanates gave different final products. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.-H.

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed with DFT show that while the sulflower with eight thiophene rings follows Baird's rule by switching from aromatic in its electronic ground state to antiaromatic in its lowest triplet state, the sulfower with six thiophene rings disobeys the rule by becoming even more aromatic in its lowest triplet state.







Abstract
Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel's and Baird's rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the individual thiophene rings. To reduce its T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes considerably between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work, in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in longer chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring (or the pair of central rings); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step reductive amination reaction between DNA&#8208;conjugated amines and aromatic, aliphatic, or heterocyclic aldehydes, utilising the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, borate buffer, and NaBH4. The methodology is applicable to a broad substrate scope, with regards to both on&#8208;DNA amine and aldehyde, and is fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing; it is a new method for secondary and tertiary amine formation in DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8722;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.

         <title>Chiral Bis&#8208;phosphate Macrocycles for Catalytic, Efficient, and Enantioselective Electrophilic Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of privileged catalytic scaffolds into a macrocyclic skeleton represents an attractive strategy to furnish supramolecular catalysis systems with enzyme&#8208;mimetic cavity and multi&#8208;site cooperation. Herein we reported the synthesis, structure, binding properties and catalytic application of a series of chiral bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles toward the challenging asymmetric electrophilic fluorination. With a large, integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites, these macrocycles exhibited good inclusion toward 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) dicationic ammoniums through complementary ion&#8208;pair and C&#8210;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O interactions, as confirmed by crystallographic and solution binding studies. In fluorocyclization of tryptamines with Selectfluor reagent which has a similar DABCO&#8208;based dicationic structure, only 2 mol% macrocycle catalyst afforded the desired pyrroloindoline products in moderate yields and up to 91% ee. For comparison, the acyclic mono&#8208;phosphate analogue gave obviously lower reactivity and enantioselectivity (&lt;20% ee), suggesting a remarkable macrocyclic effect. The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion&#8208;pair binding and cavity&#8208;directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.</dc:description>

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of PyBTM&#8208;PhPyBTM was at most 0.4% in various organic solvents. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals did not improve the PLQY. In the MesPyBTM&#8208;PhPyBTM&#8208;Mes, the mesityl group did not worked as an electron donor unlike the previously reported monoradical MesPyBTM. However, adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene did greatly improve it, and the PLQY of the PyBTM&#8208;(Hex2Ph)PyBTM was 7% in dichloromethane and acetone, and 12% in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction and Formic Acid Oxidation by Formal Nickel(I) Complexes of Di&#8208;isopropylphenyl Bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene</title>

         <dc:description>Processing CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp&#8208;bian)NiBr2 (where dpp&#8208;bian is di&#8208;isopropylphenyl bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three&#8208;electron reduction of (dpp&#8208;bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8208;bian)Ni(COD)]&#8211; and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8208;bian)2Ni]&#8211; were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in a solution, along with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient&#160; field &#160;and the one&#8208;electron electrostatic force field, along with the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulas (dpp&#8208;bian)2&#8211;Ni+(COD) and (dpp&#8208;bian)2&#8211;Ni+. It was shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton addition product dpp&#8208;bian&#8208;2H is formed.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of NVO Cathodes with Varied Lattice NH4+ Content: Effect on Structural Evolution and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex&#8208;situ structural characterizations, and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides' structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8208;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Hollow Microcubes SnS2 as Negative electrode for Sodium&#8208;ion and Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs and KIBs) are considered the most promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy storage fields. Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high&#8208;rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly. The in operando and ex&#8208;situ characterization provide a piece of direct evidence to clarify the storage mechanism of such conversion&#8208;alloying type negative electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) are able to displace the perfluorinated Cp* ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in up to quantitative yield. The resulting ionic products contain [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; as uncoordinated counter anion. The cations feature [Rh(COD)]+ fragments, coordinated by one (N, Bi), two (P, As) or three (Sb) triphenylpnictogen moieties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Idolenone is a key intermediate in the synthesis of many drugs and plays an important role in synthetic chemistry and biochemistry. A new method for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indolenones by carbonylation catalyzed by Pd(0) is described. In the absence of an additive, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;propylene (an inexpensive ozone&#8208;friendly CF3 structural unit) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to synthesize trifluoromethylatedindolenone in good yield, regioselectivity and chemoselectivity and with strong resistance to basal functional groups such as alkynes, aldehydes and esters. Notably, in addition to indole compounds being well transformed into the corresponding products, pyrrole, heteroindole can also is also suitable for the corresponding chemical transformation. This study provides a scientific method for the late construction of trifluoromethylated indole/pyrrole 3&#8208;ketene.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthropomorphic nitroacetic acid puts a plug into a socket turning a light bulb ON. After its time&#8208;controlled degradation to nitromethane and CO2, the light bulb is no longer connected to the socket and turns OFF. A time&#8208;controllable pH signal is transduced in a time&#8208;controllable voltage signal, which can be exploited to govern electric devices. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Capocasa, S. Di&#8197;Stefano and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303897).

         <dc:description>4,4'&#8208;Biazulene is a potentially attractive key component of an axially chiral biaryl compound, however, its structure and properties have not been clarified owing to the lack of its efficient synthesis.&#160;We report a breakthrough in the reliable synthesis&#160;of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene, which is achieved by the access to azulen&#8208;4&#8208;ylboronic acid pinacol ester and 4&#8208;iodoazulene as novel key synthetic intermediates for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.&#160;The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene confirmed its axial chirality.&#160;The enantiomers of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene were successfully resolved by HPLC on the chiral stationary phase column.&#160;The kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that&#160;the racemization energy barrier of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of 1,1'&#8208;binaphthyl.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological N2&#160;reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/protonation of bridging N2&#160;through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2&#160;fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1&#160;= tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78 &#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2&#160;complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature, and is so exergonic&#160;that it would be irreversible as a result of the high Fe3+/2+&#160;redox potential. This system establishes the "ground rules" for designing reversible N2/N2H2&#160;interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged Triple&#8208;Ion Clusters (CTICs) form by addition of an anion or cation to an ion pair and are intermediate species on ionic&#8208;crystal nucleation pathways. Computations show that the energies and lifetimes for positive and negative CTICs vary differently for BaSO4 and CaCO3. This difference can be related to asymmetrical nucleation behavior observed in solutions with cation&#8208; versus with anion excess.







Abstract
Minerals form in natural systems from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, 
 was found to have higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than 
. Similar trends were observed for 
 and 
. Contrastingly, for 
, 
 was found to have lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than 
. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene has significant potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and rich surface chemical properties. This paper reviews the synthesis, preparation, performance, and electrochemical reaction mechanism of flexible MXenes; Summarized the latest progress in freestanding flexible MXene composites for supercapacitors, as well as the challenges and possible improvements in their practical applications.







Abstract
MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.

         <title>Amorphous Anode Materials for Fast&#8208;charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous materials have emerged as effective solutions to enhance the fast charging performance of anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field and outlines the various strategies employed for designing anodes to incorporate amorphous materials. The challenges and future prospects have also been discussed.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time. From the anode perspective, it is of paramount importance to design materials that can withstand continuous Li+ insertion/deinsertion at high charging rates and still remain unaffected by factors such as mechanical fractures, electrolyte side reactions, polarisation, lithium plating and heat generation. Herein, the recent advancements in the design of amorphous materials as anodes for fast&#8208;charging LIBs have been discussed. While the development of this particular class of materials for application in high&#8208;rate anodes has been paid limited attention in recent literature, it holds immense promise for improving the fast&#8208;charging capabilities. This concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field, outlining the strategies employed in the design of amorphous anodes and emphasizing the crucial role played by the amorphous nature in achieving fast&#8208;charging performance. Further, the successive initiatives that can be undertaken to drive the progress of amorphous materials for fast charging LIBs have also been detailed, which could potentially improve their commercial viability.

         <title>Exceptional capture of methane at low pressure by an iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows exceptional high uptake of CH4 at low pressure, which enables the highly efficient capture of CH4 and separation of CH4/N2 under ambient conditions. The unique and strong binding interaction between MFM&#8208;300(Fe) and CH4 is revealed structurally via complementary experimental techniques coupled with modelling.







Abstract
The selective capture of methane (CH4) at low concentrations and its separation from N2 are extremely challenging owing to the weak host&#8208;guest interactions between CH4 molecules and any sorbent material. Here, we report the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure and the efficient separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe). MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows a very high uptake for CH4 of 0.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mbar and 298&#8197;K and a record CH4/N2 selectivity of 45 for porous solids, representing a new benchmark for CH4 capture and CH4/N2 separation. The excellent separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe) has been confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. In&#8197;situ neutron powder diffraction, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopies, coupled with modelling, reveal a unique and strong binding of CH4 molecules involving Fe&#8722;OH&#8943;CH4 and C&#8943;phenyl ring interactions within the pores of MFM&#8208;300(Fe), thus promoting the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure.

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) inhibition via Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (DCC). Leveraging protein recognition, in the presence of a continually self&#8208;correcting, evolving dynamic library, we were able to find novel ligands for RAGE. Our biological tests confirmed their superior affinities, as well as potential as antagonists, a fresh perspective for inhibiting this multifaceted and inflammation&#8208;associated receptor.







Abstract
RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE&#8242;s VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Double Desymmetrization via Vinylogous Michael Addition of Prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dicyanoalkenes to Cyclopentendiones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric double desymmetrization reaction has been realized through vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst. This method enables the formation of four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event.







Abstract
An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products. This vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione is catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering in Co/VN Nanoparticles to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Aqueous/Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The Co/VN@NC nanofoam exhibits a competitive difference (0.65 V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, leading to an elevated peak power density (156/85 mW cm&#8722;2) in aqueous/flexible ZABs. It is attributed to the disordered carbon reinforcing the confinement of electrons, and the coupling of components optimizing the absorption of intermediates.







Abstract
Modulating metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;support interactions is one of the potent tools for augmenting catalytic performance. Herein, highly active Co/VN nanoparticles are well dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanofoam (Co/VN@NC) with the assistance of dicyandiamide. Studies certify that the consequential disordered carbon substrate reinforces the confinement of electrons, while the coupling of diverse components optimizes charge redistribution among species. Besides, theoretical analyses confirm that the regulated electron configuration can significantly tune the binding strength between the active sites and intermediates, thus optimizing reaction energy barriers. Therefore, Co/VN@NC exhibits a competitive potential difference (&#916;E, 0.65&#8197;V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2 (0.67&#8197;V). Further, catalyst&#8208;based aqueous/flexible ZABs present superior performances with peak power densities of 156 and 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to Pt/C&#8208;based counterparts (128 and 73&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This research provides a pivotal foundation for the evolution of bifunctional catalysts in the energy sector.

Chiral propeller&#8211;shaped triaryl framework of a binaphthyl&#8208;based amino&#8208;borane catalyst induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to prochiral iminiums in asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines.







Abstract
Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8211;based chiral amino&#8211;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8211;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8211;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8211;borane catalyst through stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral propeller&#8211;shaped triaryl framework of a binaphthyl-based amino-borane catalyst induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to prochiral iminiums in asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8211;based chiral amino&#8211;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8211;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8211;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8211;borane catalyst through stabilizing &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions. We expect that the concept of chirality relay could be further exploited in catalyst design endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here: We proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of macrocyclic polyethylene glycol sulfite (PEG&#8208;MCSi), which is a versatile building block for many PEG derivatives. In contrast to batch reactions, continuous production for this intermediate proves to be stable in terms of yield over a long course, and is therefore suitable for bulk production of PEG&#8208;MCSi.







Abstract
Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4&#8197;parallel runs for up to 64&#8197;h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.

         <title>A Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Strategy to Linearly Fused Functionalized N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to linearly fused polycyclic piperidines from readily available substrates. These products can be chemoselectively functionalized to generate analogs that represent common substructures in bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Importantly, these compounds can be chemoselectively functionalized, providing an efficient and robust methodology to these important nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group rotator were synthesized. Raman and FT&#8208;IR measurements were used to analyse the effect of fluorine substitution on molecular dynamics of the phenyl ring. The electric properties were investigated with the impedance spectroscopy. ECD spectroscopy was used to approximate the solid&#8208;state structure of one of the rotors.







Abstract
Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processive catalyst undergoes several rounds of catalysis before it is released from the substrate. The drawing shows possible ways (A&#8211;D) in which a synthetic catalyst can interact with the substrate to achieve processivity.







Abstract
Processive catalysts remain attached to a substrate and perform multiple rounds of catalysis. They are abundant in nature. This review highlights artificial processive catalytic systems, which can be divided into (A) catalytic rings that move along a polymer chain, (B) catalytic pores that hold polymer chains and decompose them, (C) catalysts that remain attached to and move around a cyclic substrate via supramolecular interactions, and (D) anchored catalysts that remain in contact with a substrate via multiple catalytic interactions (see frontispiece).

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PCBM was insulated onto the surfaces of ten transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) through covalent functionalization. Comprehensive studies were conducted on their optical and electronic properties, including photoluminescence, conductivity, and photo&#8208;response. PCBM customized the properties of each TMDs, classifying them into three groups based on alignment: type I, type II, and metallic.







Abstract
In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700&#8201;% and 200&#8201;% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1&#8197;eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8211;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154&#8197;eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.

&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700&#8201;% and 200&#8201;% in &lt;b&gt;PCBM-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; hybrids. Similarly, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; hybrids exhibit a 2-fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1&#8197;eV. On the other hand, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8211;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37-154&#8197;eV along with an enhancement of the photo-response by 2400, 3200 and 600&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PCBM-WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; showed a modest photo-response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which archive pure metallic character.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the various research fields. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical preparation technique. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications. While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique. In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile. The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes. To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents. Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity. Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB. The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene. The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.

         <title>Gold&#8208;catalyzed endo&#8208;selective Ring&#8208;opening of Epoxides and its Application in Construction of Poly&#8208;ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Graphical Abstract. An efficient, gold&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides to prepare 3&#8208;hydoxyl tetrahydropyran motifs is reported. This method also allows to construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers (MLP), emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis in biosynthesizing MLP toxins. In addition, tricyclic core of macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C is synthesized over 8 steps from known started material.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran&#8208;fused poly&#8208;ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran&#8208;derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers through emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C.

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specifically functionalized carboranes (bearing NH2 and OH groups) were synthesized to be grafted onto dendrimers, but steric hindrance prevents full substitution even of the hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene core, as illustrated by birds crowned by a carborane competing for access to food. The beaks are red (oxygen atoms), signifying the strongly nucleophilic OH. The feet are dark red (phosphorus atoms), which they could potentially use to complex a few metals after they have finished eating. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8208;M. Caminade, E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303867). Artwork by Dr. Chistoph Selg.

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8211;H Functionalization?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometalation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient.&#160;A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically&#160;in situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal.&#160;&#160;This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8211;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8211;H functionalization with transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Co(II) Substitution Enhances the Esterase Activity of a de Novo Designed Zn(II) Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) are targets for de&#160;Novo protein designers due to the simplicity of the active site and rapid rate of the reaction. The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, closely mimicking the native enzymes&#8217; first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human&#8208;CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt&#8208;derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p&#8209;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+. X&#8208;ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH 7.5 that converts to a 5&#8208;coordinate species by pH 11. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy monitors this transition, giving a pKa value of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible coupling of germylone with isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (5, dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with isocyanates RNCO (R = 4&#8208;tolyl or 3,5&#8208;xylyl) to furnish novel alkyl carboxamido germylenes 6 (R=4&#8208;tolyl) and 7 (R= 3,5&#8208;xylyl), featuring a C&#8208;C bond between the former carbene carbon and the isocyanate moiety. Heating a mixture of 7 with 4&#8208;tolyl isocyanate to 100 &#176;C results in isocyanate metathesis, demonstrating reversible C&#8208;C bond formation on the reduced germanium compound. DFT calculations suggest that this process occurs via the reductive dissociation of isocyanate from 8 that regenerates the parent Ge(0) compound 5.</dc:description>

         <title>TBADT&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Stereoselective Radical Alkylation of Chiral N&#8208;Sulfinyl Imines: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Diverse Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a sustainable and efficient photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. By employing readily available non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and low loading of TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, we successfully obtain diverse chiral amines with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This method provides an efficient approach for accessing a diverse array of medicinally relevant compounds, including both natural and synthetic &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl ethyl amines, and other structural motifs commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals and natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Liquid Crystallinity and Electroluminescence via Sulfonation of S&#8208;Annulated Perylene Tetraester</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a comparative analysis of S&#8208;annulated perylene tetraester (PTE&#8208;S) and its sulfone (PTE&#8208;SO2) analogue. This sulfone modification reduced melting point and stabilized a room temperature columnar rectangular (Colr) phase in contrast to its parent PTE&#8208;S which showed a crystalline behaviour at room temperature. This molecular design also leads to red&#8208;shifted absorbance and emission in comparison to PTE&#8208;S, along with a tuning of photoluminescence from sky blue to green, achieving an impressive quantum yield of 85%. OLED devices fabricated using PTE&#8208;SO2 as emitter material at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 wt.% in CBP as host material. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9% was observed with the 0.5 wt.% PTE&#8208;SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5 wt% doping concentration of PTE&#8208;S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Resorcinarene Hexameric Capsule as a Supramolecular Photoacid to Trigger Olefin Hydroarylation in Confined Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule C6 shows remarkable photoacidity upon light irradiation, which is here exploited to catalyze olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space. An experimental pKa* value range of &#8208;3.3 &#8208; &#8208;2.8 was estimated for the photo&#8208;excited hexameric capsule C6*, and consequently an increase in acidity of 8.8 log units was observed with respect to its ground state (pKa = 5.5&#8208;6.0). This makes the hexameric capsule the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacid C6* can catalyze hydroarylation reaction of olefins with aromatic substrates inside its cavity, while no reaction occurred between them in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role in the protonation step of the aromatic substrate. A further proton transfer to olefin with a concomitant C&#8208;C bond formation and a final deprotonation step lead to product releasing.</dc:description>

         <title>QM/MM Study Into the Mechanism of Oxidative C=C Double Bond Cleavage by Lignostilbene&#8208;a,b&#8208;Dioxygenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic biosynthesis of fragrance molecules from lignin fragments is an important reaction in biotechnology for the sustainable production of fine chemicals. In this work we investigated the biosynthesis of vanillin from lignostilbene by a nonheme iron dioxygenase using QM/MM and tested several suggested proposals via either an epoxide or dioxetane intermediate. Binding of dioxygen to iron(II) gives fast electron transfer from substrate to oxidant to generate an iron(II)&#8208;superoxo species with lignostilbene cation radical. The dioxygenase mechanism starts with electrophilic attack of the terminal oxygen atom of the superoxo group on the central C=C bond of lignostilbene, whereby the second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in the substrate binding pocket that led to preferential dioxetane formation. The work is rationalized with thermochemical cycles and valence bond schemes that explain the electron transfer processes during the reaction mechanism. Particularly, the polarity of the protein and the local electric field and dipole moments enable a facile electron transfer and an exergonic dioxetane formation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Plasmonic Nanocomposites as Versatile Substrates for Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores magnetic&#8211;plasmonic nanocomposites for SERS, focusing on their design, fabrication, and surface functionalization. It highlights their potential in applications like medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring and anticipates significant future contributions to scientific and technological advancements in these fields.







Abstract
Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8211;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8211;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS&#8208;related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.

         <title>Divergent Electrochemical Synthesis of Indoles through pKa Regulation of Amides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes an unprecedented chemo&#8208;divergent synthesis of C&#8208;3&#8208;free and C&#8208;3&#8208;selenylated indoles with exclusive chemoselectivity through controlled and selective electrochemical oxidation of 2&#8208;amino stilbene derivatives. The chemoselectivity was achieved by regulating the pKa of the N&#8722;H proton. Detailed experimental and computational studies assist in explaining the ambiguous chemical nature of diversely N&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino stilbenes in synthesizing chemo&#8208;divergent indole frameworks.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic approach to access highly substituted indole scaffolds is illustrated. By virtue of a tunable electrochemical strategy, distinct control over the C&#8208;3 substitution pattern was achieved by employing two analogous 2&#8208;styrylaniline precursors. The chemoselectivity is governed by the fine&#8208;tuning of the acidity of the amide proton, relying on the appropriate selection of N&#8208;protecting groups, and assisted by the reactivity of the electrogenerated intermediates. Detailed mechanistic investigations based on cyclic voltametric experiments and computational studies revealed the crucial role of water additive, which assists the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer event for highly acidic amide precursors, followed by an energetically favorable intramolecular C&#8722;N coupling, causing exclusive fabrication of the C&#8208;3 unsubstituted indoles. Alternatively, the implementation of an electrogenerated cationic olefin activator delivers the C&#8208;3 substituted indoles through the preferential nucleophilic nature of the N&#8208;acyl amides. This electrochemical approach of judicious selection of N&#8208;protecting groups to regulate pKa/E&#176; provides an expansion in the domain of switchable generation of heterocyclic derivatives in a sustainable fashion, with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to access new luminescent azaphosphaphenalene motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a swift and versatile palladium cyclization is presented using readily accessible catalysts and starting materials to produce new azaphosphaphenalene motifs. The luminescent properties of these products were evaluated and some of the key compounds had their structure unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The phosphorus atom offers interesting possibilities for post functionalization.







Abstract
Using a straightforward sequence of diphosphonylation and a Pd&#8208;catalysed concerted&#8208;metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), a synthetic strategy towards polyaromatic phosphorus containing heterocycles was developed. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of new azaphosphaphenalenes, using easily accessible palladium catalysts and starting materials. The key tetrahydroquinoline intermediates of the reaction were synthesised via a fast and effective procedure and could be isolated as such, or further reacted towards the target polyaromatic structures. The obtained products showed interesting luminescent properties and their emission, excitation and quantum yields were evaluated.

         <title>Generalist versus Specialist Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whether assembly&#8208;driven self&#8208;replicators that emerge from a mixture of two building blocks specialize on one resource or are generalists was found to depend on their supramolecular organization.







Abstract
Darwinian evolution, including the selection of the fittest species under given environmental conditions, is a major milestone in the development of synthetic living systems. In this regard, generalist or specialist behavior (the ability to replicate in a broader or narrower, more specific food environment) are of importance. Here we demonstrate generalist and specialist behavior in dynamic combinatorial libraries composed of a peptide&#8208;based and an oligo(ethylene glycol) based building block. Three different sets of macrocyclic replicators could be distinguished based on their supramolecular organization: two prepared from a single building block as well as one prepared from an equimolar mixture of them. Peptide&#8208;containing hexamer replicators were found to be generalists, i.&#8201;e. they could replicate in a broad range of food niches, whereas the octamer peptide&#8208;based replicator and hexameric ethyleneoxide&#8208;based replicator were proven to be specialists, i.&#8201;e. they only replicate in very specific food niches that correspond to their composition. However, sequence specificity cannot be demonstrated for either of the generalist replicators. The generalist versus specialist nature of these replicators was linked to their supramolecular organization. Assembly modes that accommodate structurally different building blocks lead to generalist replicators, while assembly modes that are more restrictive yield specialist replicators.

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (PTZ doped in S&#8208;PB2) exhibits reversed and amplified yellow CPL emission (|glum|=0.13) after thermal annealing treatment. This is due to the variation of chiral co&#8208;assemblies from spherical aggregates to helical nanofibers. Noticeably, the largest glum value could reach up to +0.91/&#8208;0.82 by increasing the film thickness.







Abstract
Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32&#8197;nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum|=0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to +0.91/&#8722;0.82 at a 220&#8197;nm thickness.

&lt;b&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt;) exhibits reversed and amplified yellow CPL emission (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|=0.13) after thermal annealing treatment. This is due to the variation of chiral co-assemblies from spherical aggregates to helical nanofibers. Noticeably, the largest &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; value could reach up to +0.91/-0.82 by increasing the film thickness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co-assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) &lt;b&gt;PTZ@&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt;, which was prepared by chiral binary co-polymer (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt;) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (&lt;b&gt;PTZ&lt;/b&gt;). For comparison, ternary co-polymerized LCP (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-PT&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized by co-polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both &lt;b&gt;PTZ@&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-PT&lt;/b&gt; showed aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both &lt;b&gt;PTZ@&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-PT&lt;/b&gt; were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| values of the co-assembled &lt;b&gt;PTZ@&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt; were up to 0.13 at a 32&#8197;nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R/S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-PT&lt;/b&gt; (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|=0.024). This is due to &lt;b&gt;PTZ@&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt; could form more orderly chiral co-assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; value, and the maximum &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of &lt;b&gt;PTZ@&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-PB2&lt;/b&gt; could be enhanced to +0.91/&#8722;0.82 at a 220&#8197;nm thickness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of electrochromic devices (ECDs) is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, It is important to understand the current state of developing quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes and ways of improving their efficiencies.







Abstract
The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes As Potential Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the synthesis, characterization, and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, often referred to as charge transfer complexes. Donors, categorized as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles, and sulphur&#8208;containing aromatic compounds, are examined in their reactions with various acceptors like TCNQ, TCNE, fullerenes, and others. The article delves into applications of resulting complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes and includes theoretical investigations to rationalize the observed properties.







Abstract
In this review article, the synthesis, characterization and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes are highlighted and a special emphasis has been placed on developing them as semiconducting materials. The electron&#8208;rich molecules, i.&#8201;e., donors have been broadly grouped in three categories, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles and sulphur containing aromatic donors. The reactions of these classes of the donors with the acceptors, namely tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), benzoquinone, pyromellitic dianhydride and pyromellitic diimides, fullerenes, phenazine, benzothiadiazole, naphthalimide, DMAD, maleic anhydride, viologens and naphthalene diimide are described. The potential applications of the resulting DA complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes are also included. The theoretical investigation of many of these products with a view to rationalise their observed physico&#8208;chemical properties is also discussed.

         <title>Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Povarov Reaction: Reactivity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond catalysis, particularly cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis, is considered to be an effective strategy for organocatalysis. In this work, the cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis for the Povarov reaction between N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and ethyl vinyl ether was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction involves the cycloaddition process and the proton transfer process, and the rate&#8208;determining step is the cycloaddition process. Cationic hypervalent tellurium derivatives bearing CF3 and F groups exhibit superior catalytic activity. For the rate&#8208;determining step, the Gibbs free energy barrier decreases as the positive electrostatic potential of the chalcogen bond catalysts increases. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy barrier has a strong linear correlation with the electrostatic energy of the chalcogen bond in the catalyst&#8208;substrate complex. Furthermore, the catalytic reactions include the endo pathway and exo pathway. The C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction between the substituent of the ethyl vinyl ether and the aryl ring of the N&#8208;benzylideneaniline contributes to the endo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chalcogen bond catalysis, providing insights for designing chalcogen bond catalysts with high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>C 3&#8208;symmetric luminescent diketone with amido&#8208;linkage as a polymorphic fluorescence emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study introduces a novel C3&#8208;symmetric b&#8208;diketone compound, BTA&#8208;D3, and its monomeric counterpart, D, with a focus on their synthetic procedure, photophysical properties and aggregation behavior. Both compounds exhibit characteristic absorption and weak fluorescence in solution, with BTA&#8208;D3 displaying higher absorption coefficients due to its larger number of diketone units. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest increased co&#8208;planarity of diketone groups in BTA&#8208;D3. A significant finding is the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) property of BTA&#8208;D3, as its fluorescence intensity increases dramatically when exposed to specific solvent ratios. The AIE behavior is attributed to intermolecular excitonic interaction between BTA&#8208;D3 molecules in self&#8208;organized aggregates. We also studied fluorescence anisotropy of BTA&#8208;D3 and D. Despite its larger size, BTA&#8208;D3 showed reduced anisotropy values because of efficient intramolecular energy migration among three diketone units. Furthermore, BTA&#8208;D3 demonstrates unique polymorphism, yielding different emission colors and structures depending on the solvent used. A unique approach is presented for promoting the growth of self&#8208;organized aggregate structures via solvent evaporation, leading to distinct fluorescence properties. This research contributes to the understanding of C3&#8208;symmetric structural molecules and provides insights into strategies for controlling molecular alignment to achieve diverse fluorescence coloration in molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Chemical Frontiers: Approaches for Generating Diverse and Bioactive Natural Product&#8208;Like Compounds Libraries from Extracts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The realms of natural products and synthetic compounds exhibit distinct chemical spaces that not only differ but also complement each other. While the convergence of these two domains has been explored through hemisynthesis and conventional pharmacomodulation endeavours applied to natural frameworks, a recent and innovative approach has recently emerged that involves the combinatorial generation of libraries of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; (NPLCs) through the direct synthetic derivatization of natural extracts. This has led to the production of numerous NPLCs that incorporate structural elements from both their natural (multiple saturated rings, oxygen content, chiral centres) and synthetic (aromatic rings, nitrogen and halogen content, drug&#8208;like properties) precursors. Through careful selection of extracts and reagents, specific bioactivities have been achieved, and this strategy has been deployed in various ways, showing great promise without reaching its full potential to date. This review seeks to provide an overview of reported examples involving the chemical engineering of extracts, showcasing a spectrum of natural product alterations spanning from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling. It also includes an analysis of the accomplishments, perspectives and technical challenges within this field.</dc:description>
