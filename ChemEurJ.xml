         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the relationship between charge localization and the second hyperpolarizability &#947; in the mixed&#8208;valence state of molecules with two equivalent redox centers by quantum chemical calculations. It was revealed that the sign of &#947; reverses and their absolute values become large near the charge localization boundary.








Abstract
Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valence systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#8226;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant variation&#160;of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.

         <title>The Versatility of Diazirines: Properties, Synthetic and Modern Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazirines are 3&#8208;membered heterocycles containing two nitrogen atoms connected by a double bond. They possess a multi&#8208;faceted reactivity that holds great potential for organic synthesis. This review discusses their properties, modes of activation, and their many modern uses, underlining their underappreciated versatility: as carbene precursors, but also as electrophilic nitrogen donors, as NMR hyperpolarization probes, or as molecular tools in materials science.








Abstract
Diazirines are 3&#8208;membered heterocycles containing two nitrogen atoms connected by a double bond. They are mostly known for their usage in photoaffinity labeling (PAL), due to their stability and their facile photolysis for on&#8208;demand carbene generation. Yet diazirines possess a multi&#8208;faceted reactivity that also holds great potential for organic synthesis. This is illustrated in the present review, which is meant to be a beginner's guide for new diazirine users. After briefly summarizing the main synthetic approaches to these derivatives (with a focus on recent improvements), we emphasize some of their most critical features and properties before describing the various modes of activation toward carbene generation, some of which were only uncovered in the past decade. We then review the many modern uses of diazirines, underlining their underappreciated versatility: as carbene precursors in synthesis, but also as electrophilic nitrogen donors, as NMR hyperpolarization probes, or as molecular tools in materials science.

         <title>Fluorinated Phenylazopyrazoles for Monitoring the Photoisomerization in Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated azopyrazole photoswitches can be obtained in a straightforward synthesis on a wide range of substrates and isomerize efficiently under light&#8208;irradiation. The molecular motion can be followed by 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy even in complex systems, such as dopants in vesicles. 








Abstract
Photoswitches have been impacting diverse areas of research, introducing means of dynamically regulating their environment through reversible photochemical isomerization. Among the different classes of photoswitches, phenylazopyrazoles (PAPs) stand out due to their facile synthesis, beneficial photochemical properties, and the long thermal stability of their metastable forms. Not surprisingly, they have been applied in different fields, from material sciences to pharmacology. However, once incorporated into complex systems, following the photoisomerization behavior of PAPs with routinely used analytical methods becomes challenging. In this work, we focused on synthesizing and studying the isomerization behavior of a series of differently substituted PAPs possessing two trifluoromethyl groups on the pyrazole moiety (F&#8208;PAPs). By studying their isomerization with steady&#8208;state and transient absorption spectroscopy, we found marked trends in the isomerization efficiency and photophysical properties of the different switches. Most importantly, these molecules can quantitatively isomerize between their stable and metastable forms, with relatively long lifetimes of thermal back relaxation. Leveraging these characteristics, we highlight in this work the potential application of F&#8208;PAPs as photoswitchable 19F&#8208;NMR probes to generate light&#8208;responsive vesicles.

         <title>Unraveling Structural Evolution of Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>

Zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) exhibit structural evolution into Co(OH)2 during catalytic process, which could promote the more favorable activation of *H2O and hydrogenation of *NO3 and *NO toward the wide&#8208;potential and high&#8208;yield electrochemical ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied for various complex electrocatalytic reactions, such as nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia. Currently, their real active sites are controversial due to the inevitable structure transformations of MOFs during the catalytic process, limiting the rational design of effective electrocatalysts. Here, we clarified the structural evolution of zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) toward enhancing NO3RR. Both ZIF&#8208;67/CP and Co&#8208;HHTP/CP achieve NH3 Faradaic efficiencies more than 95% within the wide potential range of &#8208;0.2 to &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). At &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, they deliver NH3 yield rates of 87.41 and 79.11&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively, which outperform the most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Combining with in&#8208;situ Raman and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we verified the faster transformation of ZIF&#8208;67 into Co(OH)2 compared to Co&#8208;HHTP. The newly generated Co(OH)2 was recognized as the catalytic species and presented more favorable hydrogenation as elucidated by in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy. This work offers insightful understanding on the active phase of MOFs for designing reasonable active units toward different electrochemical reactions.

CID experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent the 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively), cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds, with the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#9472;C bonds.

Mechanistic investigations into the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds to form M&#9472;C (M: metal) bonds are crucial for the comprehension, optimization, and design of chemical reactions. In this study, collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent a 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively), cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds, leading to the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#9472;C bonds. In contrast, the [NiL]+ cation, without the phen ligand, produces small neutral molecules, such as CH4, CO, and C6H6. Theoretical calculations suggest that a decarboxylation&#8208;like mechanism is responsible for the generation of the M&#9472;C bond in [(phen)Ni(bac)]+ (bac&#160;=&#160;benzoylacetone). Although the phen ligand is not directly involved in the fragmentation of nickel complex cations, it significantly alters the electronic structures and fragmentation mechanisms of nickel complex cations. This work presents a novel approach for the generation of M&#9472;C bonds through a gas&#8208;phase method and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Multifunctionality, Catalytic Mechanisms, and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer multifunctional platforms to suppress the shuttle effect, catalyze polysulfide conversion, and enable stable cycling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This review dissects their diverse roles, catalytic mechanisms, and the application of in situ techniques for mechanistic analysis&#8212;highlighting COFs as powerful enablers for advanced lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as polysulfide shuttle, sluggish redox kinetics, and electrode instability hinder their practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring high porosity, tunable functionality, and structural regularity, have emerged as versatile materials to address these issues. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF&#8208;based strategies for LSBs, including their multifunctional roles as sulfur hosts, separators/interlayers, and catalytic additives. The predominant catalytic mechanisms associated with COFs are further elucidated, with specific focus being placed on electrostatic field catalysis, supramolecular channel catalysis, redox&#8208;mediated catalysis, and metal&#8208;coordination catalysis. While conventional characterization techniques have been extensively described in previous reviews, particular emphasis is placed on the application of in situ characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), which offer mechanistic insights into COF&#8208;catalyzed polysulfide conversion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8211;function&#8211;performance relationship of COFs and guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation COF&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;performance LSBs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Photocatalysts for Sustainable Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Peroxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production via COFs represents a sustainable approach to addressing energy and environmental challenges. This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation using COFs, focusing on rational material design strategies and fundamental mechanisms. By combining photochemical principles with tailored COF design, this approach offers a sustainable route for solar&#8208;powered H&#8322;O&#8322; production.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a pivotal role in energy and environmental applications, but its industrial synthesis remains hampered by high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and safety risks. Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable alternative by leveraging solar energy to catalyze H2O2 production from oxygen and water. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their well&#8208;defined structures and customizable active sites, enabling efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC). This review comprehensively explores recent progress in COF&#8208;mediated photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. It begins with an overview of photocatalytic principles, followed by a detailed analysis of reaction mechanisms and performance metrics for H2O2 generation. Emphasis is placed on tailored COF design strategies&#8212;such as electronic structure optimization and redox&#8208;active site engineering&#8212;to improve catalytic efficiency. Finally, we identify key challenges hindering the development of high&#8208;performance COFs photocatalysts tailored for sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; synthesis.

         <title>Chemical Fuel&#8208;Driven Networked Catalytic Machinery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A networked molecular machine has been developed where protonation&#8208;induced metal translocation activates catalysis in a time&#8208;programmed manner. A silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor and a [2]rotaxane undergo a reversible cascade upon fuel addition, transiently switching on the catalytic cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime.








Abstract
We present a pivotal advancement in networked molecular machinery by integrating chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven communication and catalysis. When the self&#8208;sorted system of a zinc hexacyclen, a silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor, and a [2]rotaxane (= NetState&#8208;I) was exposed to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as chemical fuel, the protonation first entailed a translocation of Zn2+ onto the receptor and, concomitantly, of silver(I) onto the [2]rotaxane, a cascade process that gradually reversed to the initial state. In the initial networked state, the silver(I) ions were tightly captured inside the receptor so that their catalytic activity was zero, while the transiently generated silver(I) [2]rotaxane (k298 = 176&#160;kHz) catalyzed the 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime. The pulsed operation of this networked catalytic machinery, driven by chemical fuel, presents a novel paradigm for cascaded signaling and time&#8208;programmed catalysis, mimicking the complexity of biological systems.

         <title>Spatially Coordinated Delivery of siRNA and Peptide Antagonist by Using Quantum Dots for Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present in this work a quantum&#8208;dot&#160;(QDs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for siRNA which shows pronounced improvements of stability against enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, cellular uptake due to positively charge, and release from endosomes. The introduction of RNA&#8208;binding peptide to the QDs surface&#160;enables the dual delivery of the siRNA&#8208;peptide assembly. Briefly, EZH2&#8208;targeting peptide (EIP103) was first introduced to QDs surface via biotin&#8208;streptavidin interaction&#160;(PQDs), followed by incubation of siRNA that silences EZH2&#160;(siEZH2). The self&#8208;assembly of EIP103 and siEZH2&#160;on the QDs surface (RPQDs) was achieved via electrostatic attraction between the cationic EIP103 and the negatively charged siEZH2. The results revealed that the obtained RPQDs&#160;not only protect both EIP103 peptides and siEZH2 from enzymatic hydrolysis but also promote their endocytosis and endosome escape. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual delivery and targeting of peptides and siRNA, offering a novel strategy for the synergistic cancer therapy.</dc:description>

A robust and simple halogeno&#8208;divergent strategy provided pyran bearing multivicinal inter&#8208;halide stereocenters. However, a different strategy was implemented for the synthesis of glucose inter&#8208;halides. The solid&#8208;state conformational analysis of some inter&#8208;halide analogues showed difference in the deviation of the intra&#8208;annular torsion angles. Moreover, we observed the shortest F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding involving Csp3&#8208;bound I and F atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische&#8217;s allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations was completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.</dc:description>

         <title>Implementation of the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base Principle for the Direct Synthesis of Bimetallic Zirconium&#8208;Nickel and Hafnium&#8208;Nickel Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Polar Pore Environment</title>

Successful implementation of the HSAB principle using a bifunctional pyrazole&#8208;carboxylic acid organic linker afforded in one&#8208;pot synthesis heterometallic (Zr/Ni and Hf/Ni) MOFs with a polar pore environment, suitable for gas separation applications.








Abstract
An important direction in MOFs is the development of materials with well&#8208;defined and ordered heterogeneity toward novel functionalities and control of important properties at the atomic scale. A great approach is the designed synthesis of mixed&#8208;metal MOFs (M'MOFs) made of different building units based on distinct metal cations. However, their in&#8208;situ formation and co&#8208;assembly into an extended crystalline framework present great challenges due to the different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We report the successful synthesis of two isostructural, bimetallic Zr&#8208;Ni and Hf&#8208;Ni M'MOFs following the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) principle. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of a 3D structure that features an in&#8208;situ formed [Ni(HPyC)4Cl2]4&#8722; 4&#8208;c nonplanar metallo&#8208;ligand that bridges 8&#8208;c Zr(Hf)6&#8208;clusters. The resulting (4, 8)&#8208;c scu&#8208;type framework shows polygonal 1D channels, with a largest pore diameter of approximately 9&#160;&#197;, decorated by Cl&#8722; anions. This polar pore environment was found fully accessible, and both materials were investigated for Xe/Kr and CO2/CH4 separation. The results are very promising, showing that the IAST selectivity calculated for a 20:80 Xe/Kr molar mixture is 8.2 and 7.1 at 298&#160;K for the Zr_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Hf_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, respectively, which is comparable to some of the best&#8208;performing materials.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation of 2&#8208;Arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]Pyridines with Maleimides: Regioselectivity Switch and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report presents the first example of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed switch in regioselectivity during the annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, achieved under low catalyst loading (1.5 mol%). The observed switch in regioselectivity is attributed to the preferential activation of the pyridine&#8208;ring hydrogen over that of the aryl ring. Photophysical studies of the annulated products revealed impressive quantum yields of up to 0.78. Notably, compound 3ba exhibited 63% quenching of picric acid, underscoring its potential for sensing applications.








Abstract
Herein, we report a palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, representing the first example of the regioselectivity reversal for this class of substrates. Notably, the transformation proceeds efficiently with a low catalyst loading (1.5&#160;mol%). A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed, supported by control experiments and in situ HRMS analysis. Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.

         <title>Redox Cycling at Tellurium: Selective and Multiple Activation of Si&#9472;H Bonds in Common Organosilanes and SiH4</title>

The tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] effectively activates the Si&#9472;H bonds of Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3), SiH4, and complex H&#8208;siloxanes and catalytically converts them in the presence of quinones into siloxylated phenols of high interest for the chemical industry.








Abstract
Redox catalysis involving the tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] was utilized for the activation of the common silanes Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3) as well as the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle gaseous SiH4. Furthermore, complex siloxanes containing multiple Si&#9472;H bonds were converted into siloxylated phenols, which are of high interest for the chemical industry. Insights into the catalytic cycle utilizing para&#8208;quinones as both oxidants and substrates were provided by identification of key intermediates and by using in situ time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations. Based on this study, the catalytic cycle is initiated by a Si&#9472;H bond activation resulting in the formation of a ditelluride species and the corresponding silyl triflate. In turn, the ditelluride species is first oxidized by the presented quinone, forming an unprecedented tellurium&#8208;based oxonium intermediate, resulting in the formation of the siloxylated phenols and liberation of the tellurium catalyst upon subsequent reaction with the silyl triflate. Our proposed catalytic cycle can be generalized for any silane used in this study.

         <title>Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 and the Influence of Void Filling with Li in the Hcp Array of P Atoms on the Ionic Conductivity for X = 0 and 1 as well as Li2Sr2Al2P4</title>

         <dc:description>
The influence of void occupancies on the ionic conductivity of the novel Zintl phases Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li2Sr2Al2P4 is investigated. Their structures and structural relationships are discussed in detail and compared to the known Li4Sr2SiP4. Additionally, a solid solution between Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li4Sr2SiP4 is presented. Methods of investigation include X&#8208;ray diffraction, MAS NMR, impedance, and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich ternary lithium phosphides have proven to be good model systems for ionic conductivity, achieving lithium&#8208;ion conductivities up to 4.5 mS/cm (&#969;&#8208;Li9GaP4). Compounds in which lithium is partially substituted by alkaline&#8208;earth metals bear the possibility of vacancy generation and thus the possibility to reach better ion conductivity and also to gain further insight into structure&#8208;property relationships. Based on the recent report on the quaternary compound Li4Sr2SiP4, we investigated the substitution of Si by Al and found the new compounds Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li2Sr2Al2P4. The examination of the solid solution Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;x SixP4 for x =&#160;0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, and 1.0 resulted in a series of crystalline materials that adopt two different structure types in dependency of x. Compounds crystallize either in space group P3&#175;$\bar{3}$;m1 (No.&#160;164) (Li5Sr2AlP4, Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 with x&#160;&lt;&#160;0.5) or in space group P21/m (No.&#160;11) (Li2Sr2Al2P4, Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 with x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.5). Li5Sr2AlP4 is structurally related to Li4Sr2SiP4 but exhibits an additional statistical disorder of Al and Li atoms, which is also found in Li2Sr2Al2P4.

         <title>Crystal Structure of Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) at Elevated Pressures from Single&#8208;Crystal Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonic acid (H2CO3) was synthesized by a reaction of H2O with CO2 at moderate pressures and temperatures. For the first time, the crystal structure of an H2CO3 polymorph was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structural model was confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Single crystals of carbonic acid (H2CO3) were synthesized in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell at moderate pressures between 5 and 13&#160;GPa by reacting H2O with CO2. Its monoclinic crystal structure (P21/n with Z = 4) has been obtained from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments at &#8776;8&#160;GPa. The positions of the hydrogen atoms have been determined from the experimental data. Density functional theory&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural model derived from the diffraction data. This is the first single&#8208;crystal structure solution of water&#8208;free carbonic acid, H2CO3. The structural model provided here differs from structural models reported earlier for lower pressures derived from neutron powder diffraction&#160;data.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric catalytic synthesis via DKR has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of emerging supramolecular macrocyclic hosts that have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing dynamic planar chirality and unique cavity structures. In particular, the conformation of pillar[5]arenes can be locked by the introduction of bulky substituents or &#960;&#8208;conjugated units at both rims, resulting in stable planar chirality. This strategy paves the way for the application of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes as versatile chiral molecular platforms. In recent years, planar chiral pillar[5]arenes have been widely applied in various research fields, such as chiral porous materials, chiral luminescent materials, and molecular machines. However, obtaining planar chiral pillar[5]arenes in enantiomeric forms remains a significant challenge. Recently, asymmetric catalytic synthesis via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes. This concept summarizes these achievements and highlights the design principles and key challenges, aiming to provide valuable insights for future research.

         <title>Recent Progress and Development Trends in the Research and Application of Anti&#8208;Icing Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the anti&#8208;icing capabilities and mechanisms of superhydrophobic coatings, super&#8208;slippery coatings (SLIPS), and energy conversion coatings based on their chemical nature. It also encapsulates the development of both monofunctional and multifunctional coatings in anti&#8208;icing applications, evaluates their respective advantages and disadvantages, and delves into the future outlook as well as potential problem&#8208;solving approaches.








Abstract
Annual global economic losses from equipment icing exceed USD 180 billion, with indirect losses being even harder to quantify. Coatings are a highly effective method for preventing equipment from freezing. This paper reviews the research progress of anti&#8208;icing coatings and analyzes future development trends. It evaluates the anti&#8208;icing capabilities of superhydrophobic coatings, slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), and energy&#8208;conversion coatings based on their material characteristics and anti&#8208;icing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper examines the anti&#8208;icing applications of single&#8208;and multifunctional coatings, assesses the advantages and disadvantages of their preparation technologies and material properties, and identifies the main problems in practical applications of current anti&#8208;icing coatings. Finally, it highlights the potential of active anti&#8208;icing functional coatings, particularly energy&#8208;conversion coatings. Through interdisciplinary material innovation and technological exploration, these coatings could enable all&#8208;weather and sustainable anti&#8208;icing solutions.

         <title>Selective and Waste&#8208;Free Isolation of High Purity Primary Amines from Amine and Reaction Mixtures by Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing primary amines either leads to a challenging separation from secondary and tertiary amine side products or a separation of the desired product from a selective homogeneous catalyst. This work presents an efficient isolation strategy based on CO2&#8208;induced waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation combined with selective crystallization.








Abstract
The isolation of primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines presents a significant challenge in their sustainable production, and existing strategies are either multistep, energy&#8208;demanding, or waste&#8208;intensive. We present an efficient process that utilizes the distinct solubility profiles of ammonium carbamate species formed through waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation of primary amines and CO2. This selective ammonium carbamate crystallization (SACC) enables the purification of challenging amine mixtures. Starting from 35% initial primary amine purity, SACC achieves very high isolated yields of up to 94% and excellent purities exceeding 99%.

     alt="Selective and Waste-Free Isolation of High Purity Primary Amines from Amine and Reaction Mixtures by Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing primary amines either leads to a challenging separation from secondary and tertiary amine side products or a separation of the desired product from a selective homogeneous catalyst. This work presents an efficient isolation strategy based on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced waste-free and reversible salt formation combined with selective crystallization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The isolation of primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines presents a significant challenge in their sustainable production, and existing strategies are either multistep, energy-demanding, or waste-intensive. We present an efficient process that utilizes the distinct solubility profiles of ammonium carbamate species formed through waste-free and reversible salt formation of primary amines and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This selective ammonium carbamate crystallization (SACC) enables the purification of challenging amine mixtures. Starting from 35% initial primary amine purity, SACC achieves very high isolated yields of up to 94% and excellent purities exceeding 99%. Additionally, the separation of secondary from tertiary amines with 86% yield and 91% purity and the fractional crystallization of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with yields ranging from 83% to 94% and purities from 90% to&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;99% were successfully achieved. SACC was also successfully employed in the alcohol amination with ammonia/ammonia alkylation to isolate primary amines with high yields of up to 84% and excellent purities exceeding 99% using a homogeneous Ru/xantphos catalyst system. The observed average metal and phosphorus losses were at a minimal level of&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1&#160;wt% of the initial amounts. Based on this high catalyst retention, the additional potential of SACC for recycling the homogeneous catalyst was demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The&#160;Molecular Properties of Honey Bee Acetylcholinesterase Reveal Opportunities to Avoid Off&#8208;Target Effects in Insecticide Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure, dynamics, and kinetics of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of honey bee have been studied and compared to AChEs in mosquitoes and mammalians. Profiling of the active sites with selected substrates and AChE inhibitors revealed dramatic differences between the species. Molecular modelling identified key arene&#8211;arene interactions unique for honey bee AChE, important for monitoring off&#8208;target effects in the development of AChE&#8208;targeting pesticides used in agriculture and for mosquito control.








Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) regulates nerve signalling and is a well&#8208;validated target for insect control in both agriculture and the prevention of mosquito&#8208;borne diseases. However, current AChE&#8208;targeting insecticides are nonspecific and thus also affect other organisms such as honey bees. The synaptic AChE of honey bees (AChE2) is encoded by the ace&#8208;2 gene, thought to have originated from a gene duplication of ace&#8208;1. Here, we analyse the structure, dynamics, and kinetics of AChE2 enzymes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera (AmAChE2), and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgAChE2), and compare them to the more extensively studied type 1 mosquito AChE (AgAChE1) and mammalian AChEs. Important differences between these AChE subtypes were identified. Profiling with selected noncovalent AChE inhibitors revealed strong AChE2 inhibitors, but the inhibition profiles of AChE2 differed substantially from those for AgAChE1 and human AChE. Modelling of AChE2&#8226;inhibitor complexes revealed two tyrosines unique to AChE2 that are responsible for these differences in inhibitor sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of considering molecular properties of AChE2 when developing AChE1 inhibitors for pest control. Furthermore, the results also suggest that including AChE2 in computer&#8208;aided molecular design efforts during the discovery process could be very valuable for reducing risks of off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Kanamycins</title>

         <dc:description>
This paper reports on creating a novel synthetic route of kanamycins A and B using the desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) reaction of meso&#8208;diol acceptor with 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and regio&#8208; and stereoselective glycosylation of diol acceptor with trichloroacetimidate donor for introduction of a set of challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as key steps.








Abstract
Structurally modified aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, have shown promise as antibiotics and premature termination codon read&#8208;through drugs to fight against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and to treat genetic diseases, respectively. Therefore, research on developing and discovering aminoglycoside antibiotics has recently increased. However, synthetic strategies for controllably positioning the two 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycoside moieties on the symmetrical structure of kanamycin have not yet been established. Herein, we report on a novel route for the total synthesis of kanamycins A and B via regio&#8208; and stereoselective introduction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as the key step. We successfully synthesized &#945;(1,6)&#8208;linked glycoside using a 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol 1,3,5&#8208;orthoformate acceptor in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst via desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery. In addition, we also synthesized &#945;(1,4)&#8208;linked glycoside using its corresponding trichloroacetimidate donor.

         <title>Synthesis of Macrocyclic Arenes with Expanded Cavities from Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring&#8208;Fused Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic arenes exhibit host&#8211;guest properties, but their internal cavities are often limited by unit rotation. To overcome this, we synthesized macrocyclic arenes from seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers, achieving expanded and stable cavities. Cavity volume calculations confirmed significant cavity expansion, and NMR studies demonstrated enhanced guest encapsulation ability.








Abstract
Numerous macrocyclic arenes have been synthesized from various types of aromatic monomers. However, the rotation of monomer units often reduces the internal cavity volume. To address this issue, seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers were employed for the synthesis of macrocyclic arenes. The fusion of aromatic units via seven&#8208;membered rings introduces a bent geometry into the macrocyclic framework, which reduces conformational flexibility and helps preserve a stable and expanded internal cavity in both solution and solid states.

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>

An efficient method to transform 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones and anthrones has been developed using Tf2O as an inexpensive and readily available mediator via unusual intramolecular rearrangement. This work expands the utility of Tf2O in complex molecular transformations and offers valuable contributions to the synthesis of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional Chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F was synthesized as a responsive photodynamic theranostic agent, featuring GSH&#8208;activated fluorescence signaling and enhanced Type&#8208;I&amp;II PDT for effective cancer treatment. After reacting with GSH, the active compound (Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F) successfully provides NIR emission and induces cancer cell death under light irradiation. In addition, the dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting ability of this molecule could benefit the efficient therapeutic effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising modality for cancer treatment; however, its clinical application is hindered by challenges such as glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescence interference during visible light imaging. This study introduces Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F, a photosensitizer engineered to address these limitations. Upon activation by GSH, Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F exhibits 5.5&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 701&#160;nm, producing its reduced form, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2&#8208;fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F induces significant cytotoxicity (IC50&#160;&lt;&#160;3 &#181;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle&#8208;specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Kinetically Arrested SERS&#8208;Active Aggregates for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>

Three chemically benign components (AuNP, CB[7] and PEG&#8208;SH) are employed to produce highly&#8208;stable SERS&#8208;active AuNP aggregates able to detect (bio)analytes at low concentrations in high salinity and protein&#8208;containing media. Tunable disassembly is embedded in the AuNP aggregate design, which can be triggered by endogenous thiol&#8208;containing&#160;compounds.








Abstract
There is great demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. However, biofluids present several challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring, and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tunable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Here, we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1&#160;nm), which have previously displayed strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations. The AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates maintain strong SERS&#8208;activity, demonstrating low concentration detection of a model Raman reporter and a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids. Moreover, the aggregates are highly tunable through facile modification of the PEG&#8208;SH chain length and grafting density and possess an encoded disassembly mechanism within their design highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing&#160;applications.

         <title>Enhancing Proton Reaction Chemistry of Aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO2 Battery by Phosphate Proton Reservoir</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZPH as a proton reservoir enhances MnO&#8322; cathode performance in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries. ZPH optimizes proton reaction chemistry, enabling high rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and cycling stability (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This scalable strategy improves proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, natural abundance, and high working potential. However, their widespread application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and sluggish reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduce Zn&#8323;(PO&#8324;)&#8322; 4H&#8322;O (ZPH) as a proton reservoir to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&#8322; by optimizing proton reaction chemistry. Specifically, ZPH stores protons during charging and releases them during discharging, creating a localized H&#8314;&#8208;rich environment that facilitates proton intercalation of Mn&#8308;&#8314;/Mn3&#8314; and the two&#8208;electron transfer reaction of Mn&#8308;+/Mn2&#8314;. Leveraging the proton storage capability of ZPH, the layered MnO&#8322; cathode demonstrates exceptional rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), high specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and remarkable cycling performance (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This work provides a scalable and electrolyte&#8208;compatible pathway to optimize proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries.

         <title>The Low Oxidation State Paradigm is More Consistent with XFEL Observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; Transition in Photosystem II</title>

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the LOS paradigm reproduce key XFEL observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition in PSII. In contrast to the HOS model, the LOS framework explains both the disappearance of Ox during O&#8211;O bond formation and the unchanged Mn4&#8211;O5 distance in the peroxide intermediate.








Abstract
Photosynthetic water splitting catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5/6 cluster in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) is crucial for sustaining the supply of oxygen on the Earth. A recent serial femtosecond X&#8208;ray crystallography (XFEL) study has provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics of the OEC during the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition, revealing that this process involves a peroxide intermediate formed via oxo&#8208;oxyl radical coupling between O5 and Ox. However, computational models based on the high oxidation state (HOS) paradigm have failed to explain key XFEL observations, including the apparent loss of Ox upon peroxide formation and the largely unchanged Mn4&#9472;O5 distance from S&#8324; to the peroxide intermediate. Here, we apply density functional theory to remodel the S4 &#8594; S0 transition within the low oxidation state (LOS) paradigm and show that this model yields results more consistent with the XFEL observations. Notably, this study demonstrates that the LOS paradigm can support the formation of an oxyl radical species essential for O&#9472;O coupling and subsequent O2 generation, a capability previously thought to be exclusive to the HOS model. Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism.

Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Il&#8208;8 Binding to Heparan Sulfate Evaluated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title>

EIS demonstrates the effect of metal ion mediation of sulfation pattern and uronic acid stereochemistry&#8208;dependent IL&#8208;8 binding.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) are crucial for immune system response. The structural features of the HS and the environmental entities, such as metal ions, can regulate these interactions. However, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the interactions because of low accessibility to well&#8208;defined saccharides and the lack of characteristic features to be determined by analytical tools. We evaluated the effect of the HS structural features on IL&#8208;8 binding affinity utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We showed that the metal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissimilarly mediate the interactions of HS and IL&#8208;8 in structure&#8208;dependent manner of the HS. We showed that in all glycans, a positive synergistic effect on IL&#8208;8 binding was observed. For several glycans, the presence of ions resulted in a dramatic increase in the affinity to IL&#8208;8, while for other glycans, a milder effect was observed. This demonstrated that both structural motifs and environmental features are crucial for maintaining the interactions between the HS and IL&#8208;8.

We report a Pd/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#9472;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts with a range of organophosphorus compounds, including H&#8208;phosphonate diesters, H&#8208;phosphinate esters, and secondary phosphine oxides.

         <title>S&#8208;Containing Double Helicenes Featuring Robust Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes with robust radical cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows twisted conformations matching DFT&#8208;calculated minima. Chemical oxidation of these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, which remained stable in solution for weeks. Remarkably, one radical cation salt achieves a room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity as high as 0.16 S cm&#8722;1 due to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions.








Abstract
This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes capable of forming robust radical cations. These compounds were synthesized via the Scholl reaction, which was modulated to an intermediate stage by reducing the amount of oxidant, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;containing [7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis reveals that both S&#8208;containing double helicenes exhibit twisted conformations consistent with the global minima identified through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon chemical oxidation with nitrosonium, these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, whose radical nature was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These radical cations remained stable in solution when exposed to air for several weeks, as monitored with absorption spectroscopy. One of the double helicenes forms &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the crystals of both neutral molecule and radical cation salt. The radical cation hexafluoroantimonate salt exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of up to 0.16 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions observed in its crystal structure. This study indicates the potential of double helical &#960;&#8208;skeletons as a versatile platform for developing resilient &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations without compromising &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with potential applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Group 14 Species Supported by BICAAC: Isolation of a Germylone and a Digermanium Compound</title>

         <dc:description>
This study deals with the syntheses, isolation, and characterization of tricoordinate bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) adducts with germylene and stannylene halides. Subsequent KC8 reduction of BICAAC&#8208;germylene adducts afforded a bent (BICAAC)2Ge(0) species and a BICAAC stabilized trans&#8208;bent (Ge&#9552;Ge) digermanium complex. The reactivity of BICAAC&#8208;SnX2 adducts were investigated toward complexation with Fe2(CO)9, which afforded the corresponding donor&#8208;acceptor (Sn&#8594;Fe) metal adducts.








Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed the successful isolation and spectroscopic characterization of a series of bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (Me/iPrBICAAC) complexes of GeCl2 and SnX2; [MeBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (1); iPrBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (2); MeBICAAC&#8208;SnX2 (X = Cl (3); X = Br, (4))]. The in&#8208;situ KC8 reduction of GeCl2&#183;dioxane in the presence of MeBICAAC led to the isolation of a zero&#8208;valent di&#8208;coordinated germylone [(MeBICAAC)2Ge] (5), whereas the reduction of adduct 2 afforded a trans&#8208;bent digermanium complex, [iPrBICAAC&#8594;Ge&#9552;Ge&#8592;iPrBICAAC] (6), having a Ge&#9552;Ge (2.3652(5) &#197;) double bond. Additionally, complexes 3 and 4 were reacted with diironnonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9 to produce the corresponding Sn&#8594;Fe adducts 7 and 8, respectively. Further, attempts were made to convert the MeBICAAC&#8208;Sn adducts 3 and 4 to the corresponding tin&#8208;hydride complex, by treatment with LiBH4, however, in both the attempts, uncontrolled hydrogenation occurred to give the dihydrogented MeBICAAC complex, MeBICAAC(H2) (9). The solid&#8208;state structures of compounds 1&#8211;8 have also been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in 3&#8211;8 that establishes the ylidone character of 5, and supports the formation of 7&#8211;8 via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.

Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; that establishes the ylidone character of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and supports the formation of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligomeric Protein Complexes Formed by Beta Amyloid Peptides and Their Molecular Associates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>

RMs stabilize oligomeric A&#946; and facilitate protein complex formation with Zn2&#8314; and TDP&#8208;43. In contrast to bulk solution, where homotypic interactions dominate, the confined environment promotes prolonged interactions of A&#946; with molecular associates, enabling structural investigations using solid&#8208;state NMR.








Abstract
The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2&#8314;) and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;&#8208;sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid&#8208;state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2&#8314; induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP&#8208;43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site&#8208;specific 13C chemical shifts of the A&#946;40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2&#8314;, A&#946;42, and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, revealed that A&#946;40 predominantly adopts a &#946;1&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the &#946;&#8208;sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.

         <title>From Nanoparticles to Single Crystals of Al&#8208;MOFs: Synergistic Coordination and pH Modulation, and Rapid Sorption Kinetics Assessment by Optical Calorimetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput studies were carried out to elucidate the synergistic effects of coordination modulation and pH modulation on the crystal size of different Al&#8208;MOFs, resulting in nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.1&#160;&#181;m&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m). In addition, the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties was investigated, showing increasing adsorption and desorption rates with decreasing particle size.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), such as sorption kinetics or mechanical and chemical stability, not only depend on their composition and chemical structure, but also on their crystal size and morphology. However, the tunability of the crystallite size of aluminum&#8208;based MOFs (Al&#8208;MOFs) is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, we present systematic high&#8208;throughput investigations elucidating the synergistic effects of different mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids (acetic acid, malonic acid, and oxalic acid) as coordination modulators and NaOH as a pH modulator on the crystal size of various Al&#8208;MOFs, with a focus on Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2. By varying the type and amount of coordination modulators, we successfully extended the range of achievable particle sizes to nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;100&#160;nm&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m) compared to traditional synthesis methods using only coordination modulators. Thus, large crystals as well as nanoparticles of different Al&#8208;MOFs could be obtained by simply varying the molar ratio of the different modulators. Additionally, we explored the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties using InfraSORP technology (optical calorimetry), revealing the increase in adsorption rates with decreasing particle size.

Bringing light to solid&#8208;state photochemistry &#8211; We introduce the first photochemical reaction using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), eliminating the need for milling media. This innovative, solvent&#8208;free approach enables scalable photochemistry under UVC light. Therefore, we designed and compared two custom&#8208;made photoreactors, paving the way for greener, more efficient photochemical reactions.








Abstract
Herein, we developed the first photochemical reaction set&#8208;up under solid&#8208;state conditions using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), a novel mechanochemical methodology that eliminates the need for milling media. This innovation outscores previous approaches in the ball mill under avoidance of milling balls and their related disadvantages. Further, it enables the facile performance and upscaling of photochemical reactions up to a factor of 10. We investigate the influences of liquid and solid additives on the rheology and performance of two model reactions and demonstrate and compare the efficiency and applicability of two custom&#8208;designed photoreactors.

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 Reduction on Tin Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study compared electrochemical CO2 reduction performance catalyzed by SnO2 under constant cathodic potential (Ec) and pulsed modes with periodic cathodic (Ec) and anodic (Ea) potentials. The latter strategy shows higher formate selectivity because pulsed electrolysis can regenerate active SnOx phase. This work enables the control of CO2 reduction selectivity by tuning the applied potential program.








Abstract
The performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is determined by multiple factors, including the optimization of catalysts and electrolyser, along with the electrolysis technique. Recently, pulsed electrolysis has been found to tailor the selectivity and prolong the stability of CO2RR on a variety of catalysts, with the most focus on Cu&#8208;based materials. The investigation of pulsed electrolysis on Sn&#8208;based materials remains at early stage. Herein, we evaluate the CO2 reduction selectivity of tin oxide electrocatalyst under constant potential electrolysis (CPE) and pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE). Tin oxide achieves higher selectivity toward formate under PPE conditions in comparison with CPE. Induced by applied potential, tin oxide catalyst undergoes obvious reconstruction and into the composite of Sn&#8208;SnO2 in the process of CO2 reduction under both PPE and CPE conditions. The high selectivity under PPE condition is ascribed to the formation of SnOx on the catalyst surface due to the applied anodic potential.

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trifluorophenyldiazonium&#8211;A Unique Radical Source for the Visible Light Induced, Catalyst&#8208;Free Arylation of Tyrosine Residues in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the unique properties of 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salts in combination with phenols, radical arylations of tyrosine units in peptide substrates could for the first time be achieved under highly attractive conditions requiring only visible light irradiation and neither photocatalysts nor other additives, pre&#8208;functionalization, or protecting groups.








Abstract
The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt, and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge&#8208;transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.

         <title>Effect of the Entanglement of Microporous Pillared MOFs on the Uptake and Release Profiles of Essential Oil Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two differently entangled pillared MOFs with similar chemical compositions but different flexibility were compared for their guest uptake/release capacity. The flexible interpenetrated MOF shows superior host&#8208;guest propensity with respect to the polycatenated one.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of coordination polymers known for their intrinsic porosity. This property, combined with their ability to exhibit some degree of flexibility, makes them ideal materials for various innovative applications, like the inclusion and controlled release of active compounds for active packaging and agricultural applications. This study aimed to characterize the uptake and release behavior of an equimolar mixture of two phenolic essential oils (EOs), that is, carvacrol (CAR) and thymol (THY), encapsulated in two microporous Zn&#8208;based MOFs with different entanglement motifs: PUM168 is threefold interpenetrated and flexible, while PUM210 is fourfold polycatenated and rigid (PUM = Parma University Materials). The guest uptake was calculated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis, whereas the release profiles were investigated via headspace gas chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (HS&#8208;GC&#8208;MS) (Headspace&#8208;Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass&#8208;Spectrometry) analysis over a period of 15 days at room temperature. The monitoring revealed the superior ability of the flexible PUM168 for a stable and prolonged release of the volatile components, while the release from the rigid PUM210 was completed within 24 hours.

         <title>Rapid and Efficient Solid&#8208;State Mechanosynthesis of Bipyridine Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemistry reaction of more than 10 metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine afford the target complexes in high yield, in a short reaction time with very low E&#8208;factor and excellent Effective Mass Yield (EMY) values respect to of conventional solvothermal synthesis.








Abstract
2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine is considered to be the most widely used chelating ligand and it has been extensively studied especially in the areas of coordination chemistry, medicine, materials, and catalysis. A mechanochemical reaction is a process that involves the application of mechanical energy and it provides a high yield in a shorter reaction time and eliminates the need for bulk solvents, typically request in solvothermal reaction.
Notwithstanding the importance of the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;metal compounds for several decades and recent advancements in the mechanochemical synthesis the development of a mechanochemical protocol for the synthesis of metal complexes bearing bipyridine remains unexplored.
In this work, we extensively studied the mechanochemistry reaction of more than 10 metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine in different stoichiometric ratio without utilization of bulk solvents, under ambient conditions and without air&#8208;sensitive procedures. A comparison of the yield, reaction time, temperature, frequency, green metrics (E&#8208;factor and the Effective Mass Yield (EMY)) of conventional solvothermal methodologies and mechanochemical synthesis clearly indicates that the mechanochemical approach is more sustainable and efficient. Mechanochemistry approach can be complementary to common solvothermal approach, and in the future, it will be required greater attention in the field of organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetism in 2D C3N4 for Catalysis in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>

2D ferromagnetic amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized via supercritical CO2 treatment. The 2D ferromagnetic amorphous C3N4 substrate tuned the spin charge density of the loading Ru nanoparticles and accelerated the electrocatalytic HER kinetics.








Abstract
The exploration of highly efficient catalysts has been an essential challenge for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, 2D amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) with obvious ferromagnetism was achieved through a typical supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) treatment process. The experimental results revealed the structural and chemical transformations during the formation of a&#8208;C3N4. Subsequently, a&#8208;C3N4 anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) without SC CO2 treatment. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ferromagnetic g&#8208;C3N4 substrate not only promotes disassociation of water molecules under alkaline conditions but also influences the charge distribution and modulates the free energy of H adsorption, finally accelerating the HER kinetics. These results impart significant insights into the electrocatalytic HER process and establish a foundation for the design of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance for energy conversion and storage applications.

         <title>Balancing Antigen Loading on Gold Nanoparticles: Implications for Future Cancer Vaccine Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of multicomponent cancer vaccines on AuNP carriers could be rationalized by the simultaneous functionalization of the antigen and immunomodulator components on the same particles. Immunization with a &#8220;diluted&#8221; amount of MUC1&#8208;functionalized AuNPs is still capable of eliciting a strong immune response. Immunohistochemical studies of breast cancer tissue showed that the elicited antibodies were specifically directed against tumour&#8208;associated MUC1&#8208;expressing cells and promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a promising antigen for cancer vaccine development, but its low immunogenicity poses a major challenge. In this study, we have investigated the effect of varying the surface density of an artificial MUC1 glycopeptide on gold nanoparticles by co&#8208;loading them with an ovalbumin&#8208;derived peptide. Our results show that reducing the density of the MUC1 antigen on the nanoparticles does not affect the elicited immune response, as high IgG antibody levels were observed in the immunized mice, which were comparable to those obtained with higher antigen loading. These antibodies effectively reacted with natural MUC1 expressed on breast cancer cells, promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity and specifically recognized cancer tissue in immunohistochemical assays. This work could form the basis for the development of AuNP&#8208;based multicomponent vaccines that will allow the incorporation of additional immunostimulatory or complementary antigens in the future without compromising the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a promising antigen for cancer vaccine development, but its low immunogenicity poses a major challenge. In this study, we have investigated the effect of varying the surface density of an artificial MUC1 glycopeptide on gold nanoparticles by co-loading them with an ovalbumin-derived peptide. Our results show that reducing the density of the MUC1 antigen on the nanoparticles does not affect the elicited immune response, as high IgG antibody levels were observed in the immunized mice, which were comparable to those obtained with higher antigen loading. These antibodies effectively reacted with natural MUC1 expressed on breast cancer cells, promoted antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and specifically recognized cancer tissue in immunohistochemical assays. This work could form the basis for the development of AuNP-based multicomponent vaccines that will allow the incorporation of additional immunostimulatory or complementary antigens in the future without compromising the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand Mediated Metal&#8208;Metal and Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in Cesium Coordination Polymers and its Beneficial Role in the ROP of Cyclic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, an infinite ladder chain, and a well&#8208;connected 3D cage were developed by tuning the substituent on iminopyrrolyl architecture. The 2D sheet of cesium polymer was efficiently fragmented into a monomeric complex by employing 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6. Subsequently, cesium complexes were found to be competent catalysts in the ROP of rac&#8208;lactide and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone.








Abstract
Designing a multimetallic catalyst based on the principle of metalloenzymes has emerged as a promising route to enhance catalytic performance owing to the combined action of different metal centers in a cooperative fashion. The cooperativity of metal centers with the surrounding ligand environment in metalloenzymes plays a crucial role in driving efficient catalysis. However, the replication of such cooperativity in a synthetic system is very challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3))}]&#8734; (1), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;3&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(CHPh2))}]&#8734; (2), and a 3D cage [Cs2{&#954;3&#8208;(C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;NCH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O))}]&#8734; (3). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (1) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18&#8208;Cr&#8208;6)Cs(&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)))] (4). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6&#160;&#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer 2 displays the highest catalytic efficiency in ring opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide (ROP), giving a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 49.5 h&#8722;1 compared to 15.7 h&#8722;1 and 24.0 h&#8722;1 for 1 and 3. The higher reactivity of 2 in comparison to 1 and 3 is due to the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity in cesium coordination polymeric networks.

         <title>Dual Organic Solvents Enable Stable Zn Anodes via Simultaneous Electrolyte Structure and Interface Chemistry Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>

A stable Zn plating/stripping process can be achieved by simultaneous optimization of bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry in a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system, using Zn(OTf)2 dissolved in DME and DX.








Abstract
Metallic Zn is an exceptionally promising anode material for aqueous batteries due to its inherent safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, its widespread application has been severely limited by persistent challenges, including water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and uncontrolled dendritic growth. Herein, a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system with modulated bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry has been developed to address the above obstacles, featuring Zn trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) dissolved in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DX). In such a system, DME can effectively disrupt the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through its electron&#8208;donating properties, thereby significantly suppressing water activity and associated side reactions, while DX preferentially adsorbs at the anode/electrolyte interface to facilitate Zn2+ desolvation and promote the preferential growth of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn crystals. The optimized electrolyte system endows Zn anodes with exceptional electrochemical performance, demonstrating unprecedented cycling stability (4000 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in the Zn//Zn cell and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (CE) (99.8% over 2000 cycles) in the Zn//Cu cell. Moreover, the full battery paired with Na2V6O16 (NVO)demonstrates excellent cycling stability with 79.0% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles.

         <title>Influence of the Substitution Pattern of Terpene&#8208;Based Seven&#8208;Membered Lactones on Yttrium&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: A Kinetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>

(&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, differing only in substitution pattern, were polymerized via ROP using a bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Kinetic studies showed faster polymerization of (+)&#8208;carvomenthide but greater control with (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. Experimental and DFT analyses revealed mechanistic differences in chain propagation, highlighting how molecular structure influences reactivity and polymerization control.








Abstract
Terpenes exhibit a wide range of structures, thus enabling diverse applications. Herein, (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)&#8208;carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using an amino&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first&#8208;order behavior, with (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide, while (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 40.8&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. The Gibbs free energy of activation confirmed the lower energy barrier for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerization, with experimental values of 81.9&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared to 89.1&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the experimental results, with computed Gibbs free energy barriers of 84.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 82.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and mechanistic differences. Refined free energy barriers were determined to be 102.1&#160;kJ mol&#8315;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and 84.9&#160;kJ mol&#8315;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, agreeing with the experimental trend. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and substituent position on polymerization kinetics and energy barriers in metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization.

         <title>Convergent Approach Toward ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides via a Chemoselective Phosphate Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a convergent approach for synthesizing well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. It involves a regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of phosphoadenosyl (ADPr) fragments with phosphoribosyl peptides, allowing for the creation of various ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides, including a di&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide.








Abstract
The preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post&#8208;translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo&#8208;ADPr fragments and mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP&#8208;ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, was prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl&#8208;ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Disorazole Z1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of disorazole Z1, a highly up to picomolar active cytotoxic natural product, is presented. An acyclic carbon chain containing a chiral quaternary carbon center surrounded by two chiral secondary alcohols was synthesized and combined with a functionalized diene&#8208;stannane to obtain the carbon skeleton of one half of disorazole Z1. Fitting two identical halves together resulted in the synthetic natural product.








Abstract
We wish to report the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1, a biologically extremely potent natural product (picomolar cytotoxicity) with complex molecular architecture featuring a 26&#8208;membered macrodiolide with lateral chains including a quaternary chiral carbon center. The complex acyclic lateral chains containing a stereochemical triad with the quaternary center surrounded by two hindered secondary alcohols were synthesized in a straightforward way by the use of two consecutive and highly diastereoselective aldol reactions with a lactone intermediate and further transformations to yield the desired (Z)&#8208;vinyl iodide. Successful esterification with a functionalized diene&#8208;stannane yielded the fully elaborated carbon skeleton. Making use of the C2 symmetry of the natural product, a double Stille coupling gave the protected natural product. Final deprotection provided (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1, which was fully identical to a natural sample.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Stabilized Bisacylgermylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 38, July 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a metal&#8208;free strategy for acyl group abstraction, enabling access to novel germenolates 2a,b, or NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b. This novel class of germylenes exhibit nucleophilic reactivity toward iron and boron electrophiles, and can alternatively be prepared by the reaction of dichlorobisacylgermane and geminal bisgermenolate at low temperature.








Abstract
In this contribution, a metal&#8208;free synthetic approach toward isolable bisacylgermylenes, a novel class of germylenes, is described. Starting from tetra(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 1 and bromo&#8208;tris(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 3, we demonstrate that simple treatment with NHCs leads to two distinct types of reactivity: acyl abstraction and germylene stabilization. Reaction of 1 with NHCs produces imidazolium&#8208;substituted germenolates 2a,b via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In contrast, compound 3 undergoes stepwise substitution to afford isolable NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b, which were structurally characterized by NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectra of 4a,b show two absorption bands in the visible region of the light, which do not overlap and have different characters. Reactivity studies revealed its nucleophilic character and resulted in the formation of several germylene/iron and germylene/boron complexes. The removal of the NHC at room temperature with triphenylborane leads to a degradation, mainly based on the instability of the unstabilized bisacylgermylene. To determine its reactivity, an alternative synthetic strategy was developed based on the reaction of the geminal bisgermenolates 7 with the bischloro&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;germane 9. Trapping reactions with NHCs results in the formation of 4a,b in near quantitative yields. This work expands the synthetic scope of main group low&#8208;valent chemistry and introduces germylenes with tunable reactivity.

         <title>Formation Of Gold&#8208;Astatine Bonds in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>

In the search for alternatives to the traditional astatoaryl bond, Au(I)&#9472;NHC complex was successfully radiolabeled with 211At by halide exchange and showed promising stability in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Mass spectrometry experiments coupled with relativistic DFT calculations support the superiority of Au(I) over Rh(I) and Ir(I) and give insights into the role of the NHC ligand in order to access stable 211At&#8208;compounds.








Abstract
With the purpose of exploring alternatives to the poorly stable astatoaryl bond found in most 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the coordination between astatine and metal&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes was investigated. To orient this work, relativistic DFT calculations were performed, highlighting a superiority of gold(I) over rhodium(I) and iridium(I), both regarding the strength of the metal&#8208;astatine bond and the metal's preference for astatine over other halogens. The DFT calculations also revealed a more stable metal&#8208;astatine bond with electron&#8208;withdrawing NHCs. Accordingly, two Au(I) complexes, [AuCl(IPr)] (IPr&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and [AuCl(IAd)] (IAd&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[adamantyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were radiolabeled by halide exchange in excellent radiochemical yields with iodine&#8208;125 and astatine&#8208;211 in a water/acetonitrile mixture with a reducing agent. While the adamantyl&#8208;substituted complex was not investigated further due to its lack of solubility in aqueous or semi aqueous media, the stability of [Au211At(IPr)] in the presence of phosphate&#8208;buffered saline was evaluated and proved excellent (96% after two half&#8208;lives), encouraging further studies with relevant cancer&#8208;targeting vectors.

         <title>Phase Selective Synthesis of SBT and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS Intergrown Zeolites Using Asymmetric Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents for Upgrading of Polyethylene Pyrolysis Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBT zeolites and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS triple intergrowth zeolites were synthesized using three asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts as structure&#8208;directing agents. The FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowth exhibited higher selectivities for ethylene and propylene than that of Y zeolite in catalytic upgrading of polyethylene pyrolysis oil, owing to presence of more strong acid sites.








Abstract
Organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) based on asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonia compounds have been rarely explored in crystallization of zeolites, owing to difficulties in structural control. Their use holds promise to regulate physicochemical properties of zeolitic materials toward enhancing the relevant catalytic performances. In this study, a stepwise alkylation of 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dab) to generate asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary derivatives has been established, enabling their use as OSDAs in large pore zeolite synthesis. Through exploratory syntheses, we showed that small Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;Et can direct the formation of SBT zeolite in multiple inorganic cation (Cs+&#9472;Na+) crystallization, while the bulky Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;iPr and Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;sBu lead to the formation of FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowths. The obtained SBT zeolite exhibited higher olefin selectivity in catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil derived from polyethylene, with respect to alike cage&#8208;containing faujasite (FAU) zeolite. Our findings expand the library of asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and highlight their capability to achieve phase selective synthesis of large pore zeolites.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Naphthalene and Polycyclic Arenes by Iron(III) TAML/H2O2 in Water Aiming at Their Efficient Removal from Aqua Natural Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TAML in the presence of hydrogen peroxide efficiently catalyzes the oxidative degradation of naphthalene in aqueous medium of neutral pH. Products are identified and key mechanistic features are discussed.








Abstract
The electron transfer from naphthalene at an oxidized iron TAML species (TAML&#160;=&#160;tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) is a key step of its environmentally relevant deep degradation by hydrogen peroxide in water leading first to naphthoquinones which are further converted to smaller fragments. Other polycyclic arenes are also oxidized, often faster than naphthalene consistent with their lower ionization potentials than that of naphthalene.

Mkrtchyan and Iaroshenko et&#160;al. report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;).








Abstract
We report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium catalyzed trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;). This is the first ever report on trifluoromethylation using in situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as the CF3 source under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The present one&#8208;pot transformation enabled direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. It has also shown a remarkable compatibility toward aroyltrifluoroborates for the mechanochemical synthesis of aryl trifluoromethyl ketones. This method offers several advantages, including operational simplicity and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the current mechanochemical approach not only proceeds under sustainable conditions but also provides a practical route for the late&#8208;stage modifications of related substrates to access the valuable fluorinated compounds.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Mn2+/Octadecylamine Codecorated Carbon Dots with Ultrabroadband Yellow Emission for High&#8208;CRI White LEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synergy of Mn2+ and ODA codecoration, CDs with ultrabroadband and efficient yellow fluorescence in the solid state were synthesized through a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal process. These synthetic phosphors exhibit a production yield of 80%, an FWHM of 98&#160;nm, and a solid&#8208;state quantum yield up to 62.8%, allowing for high&#8208;CRI white LEDs in green and health lighting.








Abstract
Exploiting environment&#8208;friendly and efficient phosphors is crucial to constructing high&#8208;quality and sustainable white light&#8208;emitting devices. Here, we demonstrate a facile and high&#8208;yield approach to synthesize Mn2+/octadecylamine (ODA)&#8208;codecorated carbon dots (CDs) with ultrabroadband and efficient yellow fluorescence in the solid state. The dots are prepared from anhydrous citric acid (CA), 1&#8208;ODA, and manganese acetate through a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal process, with a production yield of 80%, a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 98&#160;nm, and a solid&#8208;state quantum yield up to 62.8%. Utilizing the synthetic CDs powder as a phosphor to directly coat on a blue light&#8208;emitting chip, the device exhibits warm white emission, with a high color rendering index (CRI) of 88, correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4215&#160;K, and Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.31), endowing great potential applications in green and health lighting.

         <title>Vacuum Condensation of Hybrid Polymeric Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Extended Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vacuum condensation route was developed to synthesize g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure, consisting of melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system can be effectively extended for more efficient visible&#8208;light absorption and exciton dissociation, leading to a significantly improved hydrogen evolution activity, particularly in the extended spectral region up to 520&#160;nm.








Abstract
Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) has attracted considerable attention as a promising photocatalyst; however, its practical application is still hindered by the poor visible&#8208;light absorption and rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Herein, we report a vacuum&#8208;condensation approach for synthesizing g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure that contains melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains, which induces a notable structural disorder with the N/C atomic ratio less than 1.5 (the nominal value of melon). This hybrid polymeric structure intrinsically extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the heptazine&#8208;based framework, narrows its band gap, accelerates the exciton dissociation, and thus substantially improves its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Compared to the counterparts synthesized under inert atmospheres (N2 and Ar), the vacuum&#8208;polycondensed g&#8208;CN exhibits a threefold enhancement for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. In particular, its PHE activity can be effectively maintained under the light wavelength extended to 520&#160;nm. This work presents a promising strategy to break through the limitation of linear polymerization pathway during the conventional g&#8208;CN synthesis and offers new opportunities for rational design of more efficient g&#8208;CN&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Impact of Oxygen and Sulfur Heteroatom Core Substitution on Catalyst Properties of Phenoxazines and Their Performance in Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP)</title>

Phenoxazine core structural modification reveals the impact of charge transfer on stronger excited state reduction potentials. We observed that modifying the core of a photocatalyst that does not exhibit charge transfer yields a highly reducing singlet excited state reduction potential compared to a charge transfer equivalent.








Abstract
Phenoxazines are a successful class of organic photoredox catalysts (PCs) with tunable redox and photophysical properties. Originally, we aimed to realize more reducing phenoxazine PCs through heteroatom core substituted (HetCS) derivatives, while maintaining an efficiently oxidizing PC&#183;+. However, core modification with thioether or ether functionality to a PC that exhibits photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (CT) negligibly alters the singlet excited state reduction potential (ES1&#176;*), while yielding a less oxidizing PC&#183;+ (E1/2) (E1/2&#160;=&#160;0.50&#8211;0.64&#160;V vs. SCE) compared to the noncore modified PC 1 (0.68&#160;V vs. SCE). Photophysical characterization of HetCS PCs revealed that increasing electron density on the core of a CT exhibiting PC stabilizes the emissive state and PC&#183;+, resulting in a relatively unchanged ES1&#176;* compared to PC 1. In contrast, modifying the core of a PC that does not exhibit CT yields a highly reducing ES1&#176;* (PC 3 = &#8722;2.48&#160;V vs. SCE) compared to its CT equivalent (PC 1d = &#8722;1.68&#160;V vs. SCE). The impact of PC property on photocatalytic ability was evaluated through organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP). HetCS PCs were able to yield poly(methyl methacrylate) with low dispersity and moderate targeted molecular weight as evaluated by initiator efficiency (I*) in DMAc (&#208; = 1.20&#8211;1.26; I* = 47&#8211;57%). Ultimately, this work provides insight into how phenoxazine PC properties are altered through structural modification, which can inform future PC design.

         <title>Tuning NIR Absorption and Emission of Diphenyl&#8208;Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Merocyanines with Ultra Narrow Band Gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel merocyanine derivatives with a strong diphenyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine donor and a series of strong electron acceptors were developed. The indanone and indandione acceptor units were modified by dicyanovinylene groups to tune acceptor strength. Among these derivatives, DPPZ&#8208;IDD realized an ultranarrow electrochemical gap of 0.93 eV and an optical band gap of 1.09 eV. Fluorescence in the visible to NIR region was also achieved in solution and solid states.








Abstract
Five merocyanine derivatives with a 5,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine donor and various indanone&#8208;and indandione based&#8208;acceptors with one or two dicyanovinylene groups were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation for tuning absorption and fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region. Molecular conformation, bond length alternation, and molecular packing in the solid state were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction of single crystals in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By enhancing electron&#8208;accepting ability, a considerable decrease of lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) energy by 1.01 eV and retained highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) energy within 0.13 eV were estimated by cyclic and rotating disc electrode voltammetry, relating semi&#8208;quantitatively to DFT prediction. Optical properties in solutions with various polarity, neat amorphous films, and crystalline powder states were studied. The absorption maxima of the neat films evolved from 545 nm to 931 nm. An ultranarrow optical band gap of DPPZ&#8208;IDD (1.09 eV) was found from the onset of thin film absorption and well agreed with the electrochemical gap of 0.93 eV. Detectable fluorescence in the NIR region was observed in the film and polycrystalline powder states.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dipyrromethenes (DPMs) and their borylated adducts (BODIPYs) constitute a class of versatile chromophores that has become one of the most widely studied over recent decades. They combine excellent photochemistry properties with opportunity for synthetic manipulation and tuning. We report here a related class of aza&#8208;dibenzodipyrromethenes and show that they present an interesting architecture where the core adopts a helical arrangement that places terminal aryl functional groups directly on top of each other in close, p&#8208;stacked arrangement. Complexation by reaction with boron trifluoride, demonstrated to be significantly improved by addition of trimethylsilyl chloride, induces a stereochemical inversion that destroys the helix, flattens the system and switches on fluorescence. A wide range of terminal aromatic fragments can be easily introduced. Unsymmetrical derivatives can be made conveniently by simple mixed condensations, but a controlled, rational approach is also described whereby the ability of one component to homocondense (the more reactive partner) is removed by conversion to its corresponding tosylate or triflate. The two approaches have been investigated through successful introduction of complementary electron rich, electron poor, and p&#8208;extended functional termini.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Hierarchically Porous Monolithic Corn Straw@COF Composite for Fat&#8208;rich Food Pretreatment in Non&#8208;targeted Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the food safety non&#8208;targeted analysis, it is urgent to develop suitable adsorbent materials for sample pretreatment, so as to achieve efficient removal of interference matrices in food samples and &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of potential chemical hazards. Traditional adsorption materials exhibit limitations such as poor removal efficiency and high cost. To address these issues, this study presents the preparation of a hierarchically porous monolithic corn straw@COF (CS@COF) composite for efficient sample pretreatment of fat&#8208;rich foods. CS@COF combines the advantages of corn straw (CS) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offering a high specific surface area and porosity. CS serves as a carrier for in&#8208;situ growth of COF, resulting in a material with easy operation and low cost. CS@COF demonstrates strong adsorption capacity, effectively removing over 98% of triglycerides within 8 minutes from fat&#8208;rich food samples like soybean. Moreover, it achieves "full recovery" of 190 chemical hazards with 89% recoveries within the ideal range. The reusability of CS@COF for 5 cycles after elution further underscores its practicality. This innovative CS@COF composite shows great potential in sample pretreatment for non&#8208;targeted food safety analysis, providing a cost&#8208;effective and efficient solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathepsin L Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Resistant Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise identification of drug&#8208;resistant tumor cells remains a critical challenge for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Herein, we present FR&#8208;DCO, a cathepsin L (CTSL)&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe, engineered for targeted imaging of doxorubicin&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells (MCF&#8208;7/ADR). Capitalizing on the overexpression of CTSL in chemoresistant malignancies, FR&#8208;DCO integrates a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (Phe&#8208;Arg, FR) with a dicyanoisophorone (DCO) fluorophore, enabling fluorescence activation via a single&#8208;step enzymatic cleavage. Upon hydrolysis, FR&#8208;DCO transitions from an intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;quenched state to an activated DCO fluorophore, achieving a 12.8&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield. In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis in MCF&#8208;7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensity than its non&#8208;resistant counterparts (MCF&#8208;7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug&#8208;resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of non&#8208;resistant lesions within 20 min post&#8208;injection. Notably, dual&#8208;tumor xenograft models confirmed precise discrimination of MCF&#8208;7/ADR tumors from 4T1 tumors, highlighting the spatial resolution of the probe. This work not only provides a molecular tool for spatiotemporal resistance monitoring, but also establishes a modular design paradigm for enzyme&#8208;responsive probes targeting tumor microenvironment biomarkers, advancing precision oncology strategies.</dc:description>

In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in MCF-7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3-fold higher fluorescence intensity than its non-resistant counterparts (MCF-7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug-resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of non-resistant lesions within 20 min post-injection. Notably, dual-tumor xenograft models confirmed precise discrimination of MCF-7/ADR tumors from 4T1 tumors, highlighting the spatial resolution of the probe. This work not only provides a molecular tool for spatiotemporal resistance monitoring, but also establishes a modular design paradigm for enzyme-responsive probes targeting tumor microenvironment biomarkers, advancing precision oncology strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Crystal Actuation of Fluorinated Acylhydrazones Enabled by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline materials with photomechanical responsiveness have garnered significant attention in flexible actuators and micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems due to their unique capability to directly convert light into mechanical energy. In this work, four novel fluorinated acylhydrazone compounds were successfully synthesized through direct condensation reactions between 4,4&#8217;&#8208;difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and acylhydrazine compounds, including benzoylhydrazine (BHD), 3&#8208;fluorobenzoylhydrazine (3&#8208;FBHD), isoniazid (IND), and acetylhydrazine (AED). Systematic investigation of their photomechanical responses revealed distinct molecular mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD, DFBP&#8208;IND) exhibit dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365 nm UV irradiation, whereas the hydrazone derivative DFBP&#8208;AED remains inert. This confirms the essential role of [2+2] photocycloaddition&#8208;dependent C=N double bonds in photomechanical activity. Comprehensive characterization through DSC, TG, XRD, 1H/13C NMR, and HRMS elucidated the formation pathways and structural characteristics of photocycloaddition products. Density functional theory calculations revealed that energy disparities between (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) crystallographic planes govern longitudinal fragmentation patterns. This study establishes a &#8220;molecular structure&#8208;crystal arrangement&#8208;macroscopic response&#8221; multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy, offering novel insights for developing high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e. amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has been developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Productive Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Fatty Esters with Carboxylate SNS Ruthenium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carboxylate pincer complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OCOR)2(SNS)(PPh3)] (R = CH31, tBu 2; SNS = bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethylamine) are obtained from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OCOR)2(PPh3)2] (R = CH3, tBu) and HN(CH2CH2SEt)2 in acetone by elimination of PPh3. Substitution of PPh3 in 1 with PPh2Me gives trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh2Me)] (3) in toluene at 105 &#176;C. The cationic complexes cis&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(dppb)]OAc (4) and [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)(SNS)(PPh3)]OAc (5) are synthetized from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(dppb)] and [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(CO)(PPh3)2], respectively, by treatment with the SNS ligand in toluene. Hydride trans&#8208;[RuH(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(PPh3)] (6) is obtained by reaction of 1 with NaOiPr in iPrOH/toluene. The carboxylate complexes 1&#8208;6 catalyze the homogeneous hydrogenation of methyl decanoate to 1&#8208;decanol with NaOMe under mild reaction conditions (T = 40 &#176;C, H2 pressure 27.5 bar) and extremely low catalyst loading (S/C 10000&#8208;100000). Complexes 1 and 2 display remarkably high catalytic activity for the reduction of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters at S/C of 50000&#8208;100000, with high selectivity for the reduction of the carboxylate group in the presence of C=C functionalities. An easy scale&#8208;up of this process (100 mmol of substrate) has been demonstrated. Mechanistic studies show that 1 reacts with H2 (5 bar), affording the monohydride 6 that by further reaction with H2 and an alkoxide gives the dihydride cis&#8208;[RuH2(SNS)(PPh3)], which reduces methyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized in Triplicate: A Ring&#8208;by&#8208;Ring Approach to Tailored Prodiginine Derivatives for Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Through Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tripyrrole alkaloid prodigiosin and related members of this family are structurally diverse bacterial secondary metabolites. The privileged scaffold accounts for versatile biological activities, e.g., antimicrobial, antitumoral, and immunosuppressive. Its Lewis&#8208;basic lipophilic tripyrrole core and the aliphatic side chains allow for passive membrane diffusion, thereby trespassing the natural permeability barrier. However, diffusion&#8208;controlled uptake is accompanied by low target specificity, hampering the development of tailored prodigiosin therapeutics and their selective delivery to target sites. To address this downside, this work focuses on providing the chemical methodology to synthesize prodiginines that are amenable to click chemistry on each of the three pyrrole moieties and facilitate the development of prodigiosin conjugates. Installing reactive organic azides and maleimides in the A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and C&#8208;ring of the cytotoxic scaffold enables their further functionalization per azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC and SPAAC) and thiol&#8208;maleimide addition, giving rise to protein&#8208;conjugable prodiginines for the first time. The presented synthetic routes comprise yields of 3.2&#8722;4.7% over 12&#8722;15 synthetic steps and grant access to valuable synthetic elements for expanding the toolbox of click chemistry to other pyrrole&#8208;, pyrrolidinone&#8208;, and tetramic acid&#8208;containing natural products. The devised methodology for prodiginine derivatization will collectively advance the development of alkaloid&#8208;based conjugate therapeutics, eligible for target&#8208;selective delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>An Alumanyl Test Case of Group 1 Redox Interchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rationalized by a thermochemical evaluation using both theoretical (DFT) and empirical data, we show that the arene&#8208;encapsulated M+ cations of the group 1 alumanyls, [{SiNDipp}AlM]2 ({SiNDipp} =&#160; {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3); M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs] may be interconverted by redox reactions with the elemental alkali metals. These observations contradict the established E0 data and allow access to an otherwise inaccessible sodium derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Sodium&#8208;Ion Conducting Sulfonated Polytriazole and Composite Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The table of contents illustrates the structural engineering of the polymer electrolytes, which results in a self&#8208;assembled, phase&#8208;separated morphology. This morphology resulted&#160;in enhanced solvent absorption and wettability, which in turn leads to improved ionic conductivity that is suitable for alkali metal battery applications.








Abstract
The ongoing energy crisis and the increasing demand for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have raised concerns about the availability and affordability of lithium. In light of their abundance and lower production costs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have the potential to replace LMBs. However, due to the reactivity of organic electrolytes with the sodium anode, it is essential to design safer electrolytes to prevent short&#8208;circuiting. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of fillers and single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs), including sodium salt of sulfonated graphene oxide (Na&#8208;SGO), sulfonated polytriazole (PTSICPE&#8208;90), and various blend composites, which outperform Celgard 2400 in terms of thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. The Na&#8208;SGO filler demonstrated a desirable Na&#8208;ion conductivity of 11.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 Scm&#8722;1 at 90 &#176;C in a solvated state. Due to the high solvent absorption (70&#160;wt.%), good wettability (22.2&#176;), and significant porosity (58%) of the SICPEs, notable Na&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (nonsolvated at 30 &#176;C) and 1.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (solvated at 40 &#176;C) were observed. These properties make them an appealing choice for electrolytic applications in SMBs.

         <title>Bis(phenylsulfonyl)Methane (BPSM) as Multifunctional Electrolyte Additive Constructing a Stable Interfaces for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Graphite Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) as an electrolyte additive enhances the performance of NCM811/graphite batteries. BPSM facilitates the formation of a more stable interfacial film on the electrode surface. The available data demonstrate that the capacity retention of the battery at low temperature is significantly improved. BPSM showcases potential as an influential additive for NCM811/graphite batteries under the condition of low temperature.








Abstract
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) is used as a functional electrolyte additive to assist in the construction of stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial films to improve the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite batteries at room and low temperatures and compared to the non&#8208;BPSM&#8208;containing batteries, rate and cycling performance of BPSM&#8208;containing batteries can also be enhanced. After 1200 cycles at 25 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 8.68% to 83.07%. After 130 cycles at &#8722;10 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 21.01% to 98.97%. The spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that BPSM is preferentially oxidized and reduced on the cathode and anode, respectively, to construct stable and high&#8208;conductivity electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The enhanced performance reveals that BPSM is an effective film&#8208;forming additive with promising applications in nickel&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regulated &#914;&#8208;Phase Crystallization of Strong and Tough Polypropylene Through Hyperbranched Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the regulating crystallization and morphology of &#946;&#8208;nucleated PP with a HBPN and provides a new perspective on toughening polypropylene using hyperbranched topology.








Abstract
Achieving both enhanced strength and improved toughness of polypropylene (PP) remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. The present study addresses this limitation by constructing a robust crystalline network through the strategic integration of hyperbranched topology. We demonstrate that a hyperbranched nucleating agent (HBPN) effectively induces high&#8208;content &#946;&#8208;crystal formation in PP, which organizes into an interconnected crystalline architecture. This &#946;&#8208;phase network significantly enhances the mechanical performance of PP, with tensile strength and notched impact strength increasing by 35.78% (to 42.5&#160;MPa) and 140% (to 13.2 KJ/m2), respectively, compared to pure PP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergy between strength and toughness originates from HBPN mediated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization, which refines the morphology of spherulites and increases the degree of crystallinity. The hyperbranched topology of HBPN inhibits entangled PP chains and facilitates crystallization of PP chains. Thus, it contributes to efficient stress redistribution by dissipating localized energy through multidirectional load transfer, while arresting crack advancement via microvoid&#8208;induced stress relaxation. This work demonstrates an effective conceptual approach to engineering high&#8208;performance PP, unlocking its potential for various value&#8208;added applications.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Metalated Ge9 Zintl Clusters as Single&#8208;Site Homogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0 atom is fixed into a nine atomic germanium cluster core and remains active in the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene. This clearly confirms the idea to use Zintl cluster as support material for catalytically active transition metals.








Abstract
Homogeneous catalytic reactions performed without or with highly abundant transition metals is an increasing field of research due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability. Therefore, using main group element Zintl cluster as support material for transition metals via synthesizing single site homogeneous catalysts (SSHoC) could be a way to make such metals feasible for catalysis, without the risk of metal loss or agglomeration like in classical single site catalysts. A synthetic protocol for four cluster compounds K[Hyp3Ge9Ni(PR3)] (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si{SiMe3}3; R&#160;=&#160;Ph, ptolyl, iPr, Me, 1&#8211;4) is presented, in which the nickel atom is embedded into the cluster core. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI/MS as well as for 1 and 3 by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination comprising a closo&#8208;[Ge9Ni] core. The cleavage of the triphenylphosphine ligand in 1 in THF, with and without 2.2.2&#8208;crypt, and acetonitrile as well as the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene in the same solvents have been investigated via NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Fe3+ Oxidation Strategy Enhances the Nonradiative Transition Ability of a Near&#8208;Infrared BODIPY Photosensitizer for Photothermal Therapy</title>

By constructing near&#8208;infrared photothermal reagents with intramolecular charge transfer properties using high&#8208;priced metal oxides, effective killing of tumor cells was achieved.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizer NIR&#8208;2BDP is constructed through an Fe3+ oxidation strategy. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that intramolecular charge separation effectively reduces the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, broadens the light absorption range, and suppresses radiative transition (RT) processes. The decrease in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of NIR&#8208;2BDP (the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (S1&#8594;T1) is 2.5 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP, and the singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield is 2.1 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP). The low RT (only 2.2% fluorescence quantum yield) and relatively low triplet generation (11.7% 1O2 quantum yield) suggest that NIR&#8208;2BDP should have a stronger contribution of nonradiative transition (NRT) processes (and hence a higher photothermal conversion capability). Nanoparticles constructed from NIR&#8208;2BDP and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 exhibit good photothermal conversion efficiency (41.4%) and killing efficiency to tumor cells in the NIR&#8208;II window (1000&#8208;1700&#160;nm). Therefore, this study extends the sensitization window and improves the NRT ability, paving the way for the construction of multi&#8208;functional NIR BODIPY&#8208;like photosensitizers.

         <title>New Click on the Block: Photocaged Hydroxylamine, an Addition to the Light&#8208;Activatable Bioorthogonal Toolbox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retro&#8208;Cope bioorthogonal reactivity of hydroxylamines was disabled transiently with a coumarin photolabile protecting group, which could be recovered upon removal of the protecting group by a short, 400 nm light illumination. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated in bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling schemes of intracellular proteins in live cells.








Abstract
A new photoactivatable bioorthogonal function was added to the photoactivatable bioorthogonal toolbox by transiently disabling the bioorthogonal reactivity of the hydroxylamine moiety with a photolabile protecting group. The photocaged bioorthogonal function was further equipped with a HaloTag substrate to enable its use in live&#8208;cell labeling schemes. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated by bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of intracellular proteins in live cells.

         <title>Constructing Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Systems with High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Through a Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient phosphorescent systems are constructed by doping weakly emissive hosts and guests. The doping systems exhibit high&#8208;contrast multi&#8208;stimuli response in both fluorescence and phosphorescence, which is rarely reported.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted significant attention because of their potential applications in information storage, bioimaging, sensors, among others. However, the design of high&#8208;performance stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP materials remains challenging. In this work, multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP systems are constructed by utilizing the acid&#8208;base responsive properties of the pyridine group, the heavy&#8208;atom effect of halogen and sulfur atoms, and d&#8208;p&#960; bonds. Six phenothiazine derivatives are designed and synthesized. A systematic investigation is conducted on the effects of molecular structure, molecular conformation, stacking arrangements, and intermolecular interactions on their luminescence properties. Employing phenothiazine derivatives as the guest and their corresponding 5,5&#8208;dioxide phenothiazine derivatives as the host, host&#8208;guest doping is achieved through the slow solvent evaporation and the melting&#8208;blending methods. The host&#8208;guest doping system exhibits highly efficient and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence through the formation of triplet exciplexes, with a phosphorescence quantum yield of up to 63.6%. The doping systems exhibit higher&#8208;contrast acid&#8208;base, acid&#8208;thermal, and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive luminescence characteristics than the single compounds. The potential applications of these systems in sensors, multicolor patterning, and multi&#8208;information encryption are explored.

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active H6HHTP ligand is isolated in two redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand allows accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes, increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system.








Abstract
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8722;/cat2&#8722; couples of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition versus Migratory Insertion Pathways in the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Heck Reaction: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction&#8221; could in principle proceed either via nucleophilic attack by triflate, or by migratory alkene insertion. This DFT study shows that nucleophilic attack is strongly preferred but ligand dependent.








Abstract
The initial reaction steps in the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalyzed by P^N chelated Au(III) complexes have been studied computationally. Two mechanistic alternatives have been explored: (1) alkene coordination and insertion into a gold&#8208;carbon bond, and (2) nucleophilic attack on a gold(III) alkene adduct. The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]2+ dication (alkene&#160;=&#160;C2H4, H2C&#9552;CHEt, or H2C&#9552;CEt2), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1&#8208;alkenes (P^N&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;C6H4NMe2(PR2); R&#160;=&#160;H, Me, 1&#8208;adamantyl). This polarization increases with steric hindrance and with the inclusion of an OTf&#8208; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the trans&#8208;influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favored. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron&#8208;donating &#8208;PMe2 donor trans to Ph, sufficiently destabilizes the Au&#9472;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2&#8208;insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1&#8208;insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en route to Heck&#8208;type olefins can therefore be ruled out.

The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dication (alkene&#160;=&#160;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&#9552;CHEt, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&#9552;CEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1-alkenes (P^N&#160;=&#160;1,2-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); R&#160;=&#160;H, Me, 1-adamantyl). This polarization increases with steric hindrance and with the inclusion of an OTf&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favored. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron-donating -PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; donor &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; to Ph, sufficiently destabilizes the Au&#9472;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2-insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd-catalyzed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1-insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en route to Heck-type olefins can therefore be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ca2+ Stabilized by Carborate Anions: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium salts consisting of Ca2+ weakly coordinated by carborate counterions have been prepared through anhydrous and aqueous methods. The Ca2+ center is sufficiently Lewis acidic to weakly coordinate olefins, alkynes and aromatics, and catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes.








Abstract
The syntheses of calcium carborates, Ca[HexCB11Cl11]2, 1, Ca[HCB11Cl11]2, 2, and Ca[MeCB11Cl11]2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), 3&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), (o&#8208;DFB&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene) including the structure of 2&#183;4(o&#8208;DFB) are described. The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies, the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o&#8208;DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) were DFT&#8208;calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31&#160;+&#160;G**) at 211.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and 217.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (1,5&#8208;COD) and 2,6&#8208;octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly. Compound 1 also displays moderate activity as a catalyst for transfer hydrogenation catalysis and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (COM), a first for Ca compounds.

A double click&#8208;strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8208;Alder reactions involving a reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained diene is reported. Three different one&#8208;pot protocols (i.e., sequential or three&#8208;component reactions) are proposed and offer valuable guidance for future applications. The reactions are performed under mild conditions (37 &#176;C in H2O/iPrOH for 1&#8208;2&#160;hours) and can afford the desired bioconjugates in good overall isolated yields. Successfully applied on small peptides, the method demonstrates its efficiency and interest toward applications in chemical biology.








Abstract
We report an efficient double&#8208;click strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions, enabled by newly designed heterobifunctional platforms bearing orthogonal clickable groups: alkyne&#8211;dithioester, alkyne&#8211;maleimide, or azide&#8211;diene. These platforms were evaluated through both one&#8208;pot sequential protocols (CuAAC/DA or CuAAC/thia&#8208;DA) and three&#8208;component reactions (3CR), using model substrates with complementary functionalities. The use of a highly reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained exocyclic diene, enabled rapid cycloadditions with maleimide or phosphonodithioester dienophiles. All reactions were performed under mild, biocompatible conditions (37&#160;&#176;C, 1:1 H&#8322;O/iPrOH, 1&#8211;2&#160;hours), and most afforded the desired conjugates in good isolated yields. The methodology was further validated through the successful bioconjugation of three small peptides with either a fluorophore or biotin, demonstrating its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with biologically relevant functional groups.

         <title>Supramolecular Polyelectrolyte Film for Spontaneous Electricity Generation With Photoresponsive Output Signals and Intrinsic Recyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an alternative new type of spontaneous moisture electricity generator, a recyclable polyelectrolyte film was developed by the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of LA and polyelectrolyte HA, with an azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid. This film can absorb ambient moisture and induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow, thereby enabling electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals.








Abstract
Developing recyclable polymeric films for spontaneous power generation with stimuli&#8208;responsive output signals is a significant step toward sustainable wearable sensors, fashion textiles, etc., which remains highly challenging. Herein, we developed polyelectrolyte films for moisture&#8208;sorption&#8208;based electricity generation with photoresponsive electrical output signals from supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of lipoic acid (LA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with amphiphilic azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid via an evaporation&#8208;induced polymerization process. Due to the intrinsic hygroscopic property and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structure with water channels, the corresponding polyelectrolyte films can absorb ambient moisture to induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow in the water channels, enabling spontaneous electricity generation. The polyelectrolyte film (0.4&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;1.5&#160;cm) generated currents up to 11.8 nA at ambient conditions (21.6&#176;C and 69% RH). Notably, an immediate increase of current signal was observed by exposure to UV light because of variations in molecular geometry and polarity of the azobenzene dopant between trans and cis isomers. Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re&#8208;evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.

         <title>A Supramolecular System of Bioactive Ionic Liquid, Peony Extract, and Peptide for Enhanced Permeability and Synergistic Skincare Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a sustainable supramolecular system composed of naturally derived ingredients: PE, AHP8, and a bioactive ionic liquid from betaine and MA, which offers multiple anti&#8208;aging benefits while promoting skin permeability.








Abstract
The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple antiaging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid (MA) ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration, but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.

In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple antiaging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide-8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid (MA) ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration, but also exerts synergistic anti-aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti-wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical- and reactive oxygen species-scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Sp2 Conjugated Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastable redox&#8208;acitve PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF has been synthesized for sustainable energy storage, with more than 100% capacitance retention even after 5000 charging/discharging cycles during the electrochemical process.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with reversible redox&#8208;active units are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. The highly extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated redox&#8208;active PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF is synthesized via Schiff&#8208;base condensation between p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPDA) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;(p&#8208;formylphenoxy)1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) monomers. The ample redox active sites of PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF enabled exceptional energy storage, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 250 F g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 34.72&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 current density. The material demonstrated extraordinary cycling stability, retaining over 100% capacitance after 5000 cycles at 7 A g&#8722;1 current density. This superior performance is attributed to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, abundant redox&#8208;active centers, and an efficient charge transport pathway, making it an ideal supercapacitor electrode material. The presence of diamine moieties enhanced conductivity, while redox&#8208;active imine sites facilitated hydrogen ion storage. Electrochemical investigations under acidic conditions revealed significant perturbations in the electronic structure, elucidating the redox charge storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation in HOMO and LUMO orbitals, providing key insights into charge mobility. This study presents a novel strategy for designing redox&#8208;active COFs for high&#8208;performance pseudocapacitive energy storage.

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SPs and gels emerged as modular platforms for asymmetric catalysis. This review ranks literature reports according to the achiral or chiral nature of the monomers bearing the catalytic site. New paradigms showcased by this approach are particularly highlighted, such as catalysts operating with a low amount of chiral inducers, or with no chiral inducer, and the development of switchable asymmetric catalysts.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) and gels, formed by the spontaneous assembly of small molecules through various types of noncovalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on SPs and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic SPs have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured 1D assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in the absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;activity relationship between the microstructure of MHPs and various photocatalytic properties was prospected, including excited state structural distortion, energy level rearrangement, and ion doping.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in lead&#8208;free perovskite materials (LFPMs). By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Advances in Copper and Nickel C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O Cross&#8208;Couplings of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ancillary Ligand Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important recent advances in ancillary ligand design that enable superlative copper or nickel catalyst systems for C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of inexpensive and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple thermal conditions are discussed.








Abstract
The evolution of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling chemistry into first&#8208;choice methods for the synthesis of aniline and phenol derivatives can be attributed to innovations in ancillary ligand design that facilitate challenging elementary steps of thermal catalysis. Inspired by this strategy, and in the quest to establish more sustainable thermal base metal catalysis that is competitive with and complementary to such precious metal protocols, several successful mechanism&#8208;inspired ancillary ligand classes for use in enabling high&#8208;performing copper and nickel catalysts have emerged over the last decade. In this Review we document key ancillary ligand advances of this type, with a focus on superlative copper and nickel catalysts that enable C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of cheap and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple conditions of relevance to end&#8208;users in academia and industry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Chlorination and Bromination of Pyrazolopyridines and Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report electrophilic ring&#8208;opening halogenation of pyrazolopyridines and isoxazoles. Selective cleavage of C&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds enables the synthesis of tertiary chlorinated and brominated compounds under mild conditions.








Abstract
We report the development of electrophilic ring&#8208;opening chlorination and bromination reactions of pyrazoloazines and isoxazoles using chlorinating and brominating agents. These transformations proceed via selective cleavage of heteroaromatic N&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds, delivering structurally diverse tertiary halogenated compounds. Furthermore, treatment of formylated pyrazolopyridines with two equivalents of chlorinating or brominating agents afforded dihalogenated products in good yields. This strategy represents a valuable platform for constructing halogenated scaffolds from simple heteroaromatic precursors and broadens the synthetic utility of skeletal transformations in the functionalization of heteroaromatics.

Abstract
[{Cp'Fe(&#956;&#8208;I)}2] (I; Cp&#8217; = &#951;5&#8211;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2) reacts with [Na(OCP)(1,4&#8208;dioxane)x] and K(OCAs) to yield [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;P2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (1) and [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;As2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (3), respectively. While complex 1 was previously accessed by Scherer and co&#8208;workers using rather harsh reaction conditions, the new synthetic method already proceeds at ambient temperature. UV&#8208;light irradiation of 1 and 3 induces CO release forming complexes [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)] (E&#160;=&#160;P (2) and As (4)), respectively. However, both reactions also yielded several byproducts which were spectroscopically identified. Furthermore, upon thermally triggered CO elimination from 3 the Fe3As6&#8208;cluster [(Cp'Fe)3(As3)2] (5) is isolated in low yield. In addition, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra were recorded on complexes 1&#8211;4 and computational studies complement the experimental findings and provide additional insights into the bonding in these complexes and the reaction pathways resulting in the formation of complexes 1&#8211;4.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and in Vitro Selection of De Novo Thiazole&#8208;Containing Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Thz moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. Here, we report an in vitro selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides, established through a posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand development in pseudo&#8208;natural peptide discovery.








Abstract
Backbone thiazole (Thz) moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial Thz&#8208;containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display&#8208;based selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides (ThzteMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline (Thn), which is further oxidized using the substrate&#8208;tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a Thz moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl&#8208;mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 (PAK4). This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand discovery of pseudo&#8208;natural peptides and to investigate the functional benefit of their backbone Thzs.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Bimetallic Cu(II) Compounds as Potent Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents with Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitory Activity Against Multidrug Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>

         <dc:description>
This study describes a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with MBL inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated MDR gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. The as&#8208;synthesized Cu(II) compounds exhibited significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex vivo applicability studies. These compounds also blocked the activity of MBLs via strong interactions with the active sites of enzymes, thus restoring the normal activity of the antibiotics.








Abstract
In this research, a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds has been discovered as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1). As the traditional strategies for antibiotic development are proving inadequate against the swift evolution of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need to establish novel antibacterial strategies with mechanism different from those of prevailing antibiotics. Thus, the 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;{N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridylmethyl)amine}methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (H3L)&#8208;incorporated three bimetallic Cu(II) compounds, [Cu2L(H2O)(Cl)]&#183;H2O (1), [Cu2L(H2O)(NO3)]&#183;H2O (2) and [Cu2L(H2O)(CH3CO2)]&#183;H2O (3) has been strategically designed and synthesized with an unsymmetrical coordination arrangement that synergistically modifies the electronic environment of Cu centers for the enhancement of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. The electronic environment of Cu(II) and its adjoining atoms has been further modified by substituting Cl&#8722; in 1 by NO3&#8722; in 2 and CH3CO2&#8722; in 3. The standard nitrocefin assay disclosed that 1&#8211;3 significantly inhibited the activity of MBLs produced by Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1 at the half minimum inhibitory concentration (1/2 MIC). Molecular docking study suggested an excellent propensity of these Cu compounds for binding with MBL&#8208;producing proteins such as Verona integron&#8208;encoded metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (VIM&#8208;1), Sao Paulo metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (SPM&#8208;1), imipenemase (IMP&#8208;1), AmpC, and New Delhi metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (NDM&#8208;1). However, the best possible interaction was observed for VIM&#8208;1 protein. All three Cu(II) compounds displayed significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex vivo applicability studies. However, 1 and 3 showed an outstanding activity with MIC values of 200 and 150 &#181;g/mL, respectively, in comparison to 2 with an MIC of 300 &#181;g/mL. They showed an exceptional combinatorial activity when examined with five different commercially accessible &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based antibiotics, such as amoxicillin (AMX), chloramphenicol (CHL), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CTR), and cefoxitin (CX) against Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. It has been suggested that the as&#8208;synthesized Cu compounds also blocked the activity of MBLs via strong interactions with the active sites of enzymes, thus restoring the normal activity of the antibiotics. Our study disclosed that 1&#8211;3 could be the emergent drug leads and attract great attention to the materials and biological chemists, combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

         <title>Hydrophobic and Polarized Aromatic Residues Promote Internalization of Arg&#8208;Rich Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides through Ionpair&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>

By introducing analogues of Trp in Ar/Trp cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, we investigated the role of this unique amino acid in the cell uptake and interaction with cell membrane partners using experimental and computational approaches.








Abstract
Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are small sequences that can cross cell membranes. Arg and Trp are highly prevalent amino acids in natural and synthetic efficient CPP sequences. In particular, Trp is essential and cannot be substituted by other hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids. The aim of the present study is to decipher the role of Trp in synthetic Arg/Trp CPP sequences. To do so, a small peptide library in which this residue was substituted by other natural or nonnatural amino acids was designed. Internalization of these peptides in cells was evaluated, and it appeared that combining aromaticity and hydrophobicity in the presence of Arg residues leads to enhanced internalization. The study of the interaction of these peptides with model lipid membranes revealed that the modulation of hydrophobicity promoted insertion in bilayers but had little impact on the binding affinity. On the other hand, more hydrophobic substitutes of Trp led to more favorable binding enthalpies to heparin. With density functional theory (DFT) analysis, we suggest that ion&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the aromatic ring and the ion pair formed by the positively charged Arg and the negatively charged cell surface groups can be established and could be at the origin of the unique internalization properties of Trp&#8208;containing Arg&#8208;rich CPPs.

         <title>An Anionic Vanadium Thionitrosyl Complex Supported by an Anilide&#8208;Bis(aryloxide) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic vanadium thionitrosyl complex was prepared by reaction of a vanadium nitrido complex with elemental sulfur. The thionitrosyl complex can be formally described as a vanadium(V) complex coordinated by a [NS]3&#8722; ligand, with a significant contribution from a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond.








Abstract
Reaction of [{K(dme)}{(ONO)V&#8801;N}]2 ([ONO]3&#8722; = anilide&#8208;bis(aryloxide)) with elemental sulfur afforded an anionic thionitrosyl complex [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NS)], which could be isolated as a dark red solid. The solid&#8208;state metrical parameters suggest that it is best described with a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond. Reaction with PPh3 occurred with sulfur atom transfer to form the nitride and SPPh3. The thionitrosyl complex underwent S&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides to form a sulfenylimido complex [(ONO)V(NSR)] (R&#160;=&#160;Me, CH2C6H4&#8208;4&#8208;Me). Reactions with Me3SiCl and BPh3 resulted in the formation of [(ONO)V(NSiMe3)] and [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NBPh3)] along with concomitant loss of sulfur. When treated with CO2, CS2, and PhNCS, the reactions took place across the V&#8211;N bond to generate [(ONO)VE] (E&#160;=&#160;O, S). The thionitrosyl complex was unstable in toluene and underwent dimerization via loss of K2S to afford [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSN)]. Reaction of the thionitrosyl complex with [Cp2Fe][PF6] gave a mixture of products containing the NSN complex and [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSSN)].

         <title>Diethenyl Sulfoximine (DESI) as an Irreversible Lysine&#8208;Targeting Warhead Enables the Design of Covalent Allosteric EGFR Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DESI is a novel lysine covalent warhead with moderate reactivity and hydrolytic stability, which can form a stable six&#8208;membered cyclic adduct with lysine. DESI&#8208;derived EGFR allosteric inhibitor&#160;4&#160;selectively modifies the catalytic lysine K745, thus potently inhibiting the activity of EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S kinase and corresponding engineered BaF3 cell proliferation as a single agent.








Abstract
Targeting lysine residues with covalent inhibitors is challenging due to their abundance in the proteome and the protonation of lysine's &#949;&#8208;amino group, which diminishes its reactivity. This study introduces diethenyl sulfoximine (DESI) as a novel bio&#8208;orthogonal aminophilic electrophile that can react with lysine via double conjugate addition to form a cyclic adduct. The second addition promotes the entire and efficient electrophilic attack by the &#949;&#8208;amino of lysine on the ethenyl groups. DESI exhibits superior aqueous stability, overcoming the hydrolysis issue encountered by most reported lysine&#8208;targeting covalent agents. Incorporation of DESI in the allosteric pocket binder EAI045 of oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) yields compound 4, which specifically reacts to the catalytic lysine (Lys745). Compound 4 showed potent inhibition of EGFR&#8208;driven cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.789&#160;&#181;M and 1.22&#160;&#181;M in engineered BaF3&#8208;EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and NCI&#8208;H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack of cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off&#8208;targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next&#8208;generation precision medicines.

         <title>Role of an Auxiliary Donor and Ethynyl &#960;&#8208;Spacer in a New Phenothiazine Derivative as a Dye for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of incorporating an auxiliary donor (4&#8208;methoxyethynyl moiety) into the PTZ structure on key physicochemical properties&#8212;such as thermal, optical, and electrochemical characteristics&#8212;as well as on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices was investigated. The study was further supported by theoretical calculations.








Abstract
A new donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acrylic acid (PEDCA) has been synthesized in good yield and was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopies. The obtained phenothiazine (PTZ) derivative was explored in dye&#8208;sensitized and tandem dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (TDSCs). For reference purposes, the devices based on commercial organometallic dye N719 and a similar PTZ&#8208;based dye but without auxiliary donor and ethynyl &#960;&#8208;spacer, that is, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acrylic acid (PEC) were used. The experimental results had also been supported by theoretical calculations performed by employing density functional theory. It was observed that the presence of an auxiliary donor and an ethynyl &#960;&#8208;spacer in PTZ unexpectedly decreased the molar absorption coefficient. However, this modification positively influenced the dye loading on the photoanode, which led to a 37% increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) compared to the device sensitized with PEC. Further modifications to the device architecture allowed to obtain DSSC with efficiency above 7%. Despite the fact that the molar absorption coefficients of the PEC solution were higher compared to the PEDCA solution, the key issue is the number of dye molecules, which determines the photocurrent obtained, as shown in the following studies.

         <title>Discotic Liquid Crystalline Phenazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules has made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals. Their charge&#8208;carrying ability in electrolytes makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based discotic liquid crystals and their significance in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent&#160;N6&#160;Versus&#160;Cvinyl&#160;Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations</title>

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary tranformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#8211;N versus C&#8211;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl adenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of BICAAC Organocatalyst: Hydroboration of Carbonyl and Alkyne Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (BICAAC) (I) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (I) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst II). This active species facilitates substrate activation. A subsequent hydride transfer from an additional equivalent of HBpin to the activated substrate completes the reduction process. This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor. The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>The Nature and Stability of Transition Metal&#8208;Anchored Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene single&#8208;atom catalysts represent an emerging class of catalysts that combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To prevent demetallation and ensure catalyst stability, sufficiently strong bonds between the transition metal and support are essential. We have quantum chemically analyzed the trend in bonding interaction between period 4 transition metals (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and the four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support. We find that the metal&#8211;support interactions strengthen from Ti to Ni but weaken from Ni to Zn. Activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that this trend stems from changes in the interaction between the metal&#8217;s 3dxy&#160;atomic orbital and the nitrogen lone pair orbitals of the support. As we move along period 4, the bonding mechanism changes from&#160;an increasingly more stabilizing HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction (TM = Ti&#8208;Ni), due to the higher effective nuclear charge of the metal, to a less favorable HOMO&#8211;SOMO (TM = Cu) and unfavorable HOMO&#8211;HOMO (TM = Zn) interaction, as a result of the filling of the metal&#8217;s 3dxy&#160;atomic orbital. This results in the observed strengthening, followed by weakening, of the metal&#8211;support interaction. These insights could guide the rational design of future single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Heterotrimetallic Assemblies Based on Rod&#8208;Shaped FeII&#8208;Metalloligands and a ZnII&#8208;Porphyrin/RuII&#8208;Metallacycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient strategy for the preparation of heterometallic discrete porphyrin assemblies, tuned both in dimensions and number of metal centers, is described. Five rod&#8208;shaped di&#8208;pyridyl FeII&#8208;metalloligands, with varied length (1.5 &#8211; 3.2 nm), lateral substituents, and number of iron centers, were used to bridge two RuII&#8208;metallacycles, made of two coplanar ZnII&#8208;porphyrin each. The resulting architectures consist of four RuII complexes, four zinc&#8208;porphyrins, and either two or four FeII&#8208;clathrochelate units. Earlier, geometrically similar sandwich&#8208;like architectures were based on purely organic connectors. Among other novel characteristics, the use of metalloligands was found to be beneficial for the overall stability, thus allowing for a solution&#8208;based characterization of the assemblies. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures were determined for the complete collection, highlighting additional key features: the two facing ZnII&#8208;porphyrin platforms are set wide apart according to the span of the two connecting metalloligands, while the latter are parallelly aligned by the anchoring ZnII&#8208;porphyrin/RuII&#8208;metallacycles, at fixed inter Fe&#183;&#183;Fe distance(s). Mutual control over these geometrical parameters is very strict, as evidenced by self&#8208;sorting experiments. Useful implementation of these systems into functional systems may be envisaged by pairing the peripheral metalloporphyrin photosensitizers with photo/redox/catalytically active inner metal cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium Catalysts by Co&#8208;Cyclization of Two Different Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various rhodium catalysts with densely substituted pi&#8208;ligands have been synthesized in one step by selective co&#8208;cyclization of two alkynes. Tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;acetylene typically gives cyclopentadienyl ligands, whereas trimethylsilyl&#8208;acetylene produces pentalene&#8208;type structures. The resulting complexes catalyze regioselective C&#9472;H activation and annulation of arylhydroxamic acids.








Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl rhodium complexes (C5R5)RhLx are widely used as homogeneous catalysts. Herein we report the synthesis of such complexes with structurally diverse cyclopentadienyl ligands in one step directly from alkynes. Specifically, reactions of bulky terminal alkynes (tert&#8208;butylacetylene or trimethylsilylacetylene) with activated internal alkynes (ethyl 2&#8208;butynoate or dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD)) and [(cod)RhCl]2 produce either cyclopentadienyl or pentalene&#8208;type complexes (L)Rh(cod) in 60&#8211;95% yields. Oxidation of these Rh(I) complexes with halogens afforded the corresponding Rh(III) derivatives [(L)RhHal2]2, which can catalyze C&#9472;H activation of phenylhydroxamate, giving products with varying regioselectivity depending on the substituents in pi&#8208;ligands.

&lt;p&gt;Various rhodium catalysts with densely substituted pi-ligands have been synthesized in one step by selective co-cyclization of two alkynes. Tert-butyl-acetylene typically gives cyclopentadienyl ligands, whereas trimethylsilyl-acetylene produces pentalene-type structures. The resulting complexes catalyze regioselective C&#9472;H activation and annulation of arylhydroxamic acids.

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno's first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy while recent developments led to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno's first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dehydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.

         <title>Removal of Phaeocystis Globosa From Seawater via Polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;Modified Pyrite Activated Persulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa) is a highly motile and toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in marine environments. The outbreak of P. globosa poses severe threats to aquaculture and coastal nuclear power safety and causes economic losses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel algal removal technologies to control P. globosa blooms. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;modified pyrite (PVP&#8208;FeS2) was synthesized as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removing P. globosa in seawater. The introduction of PVP effectively modulated the morphology, particle size, and catalytic performance of FeS2. The results demonstrated that a system containing 0.3&#160;g/L PVP&#8208;FeS&#8322; and 0.8&#160;mM PS achieved 95.9% removal efficiency of P. globosa within 4&#160;hours. The Fe and S species on the PVP&#8208;FeS2 surface played critical roles in activating PS to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) for algal cell oxidation and produce iron hydroxides to promote the flocculation of algal cells. In addition, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system maintained the integrity of algal cells and avoided the release of large amounts of intracellular organic matter. More importantly, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system can simultaneously remove multiple HABs from seawater, and is expected to be applied in the field of emergency mitigation of red tide events.

         <title>C,N&#8208;Chelated Organogermanium(II) Hydride as Catalyst for Esterification of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) reacts with potassium alkoxides to give potassium hydrido&#8208;alkoxo&#8208;germanato&#8208;borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R&#160;=&#160;tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Moreover, complex 1 was tested as useful catalyst for esterification of aldehydes by KOtBu to yield t&#8208;butyl esters of appropriated carboxylic acids.








Abstract
The reactions of the monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) with potassium alkoxides KOR provided potassium hydrido&#8208;alkoxo&#8208;germanato&#8208;borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R&#160;=&#160;tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Compounds 2 and 3 react with benzaldehyde under formation of alkyl esters of benzoic acid along with elimination of a neutral complex L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1). Thus complex 1 was tested as a useful catalyst for esterification of aldehydes by KOtBu. The GC&#8208;MS analysis revealed formation of t&#8208;butyl esters of appropriated carboxylic acids. The mechanistic studies for the esterification of benzaldehyde with KOtBu catalyzed by 1 were also performed either theoretically (DFT calculations), or experimentally (NMR and IR spectroscopy).

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release of Branched Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release branched prodrugs can amplify the amount of cargo activated. However, balance between the &#8220;click&#8221; and &#8220;release&#8221; steps is essential. Branched pro&#8208;fluorophores provided the fastest&#8208;to&#8208;date click reaction of aryl azides and TCOs. The second branched core enabled the self&#8208;immolation, releasing higher levels of fluorophore than the corresponding monomeric profluorophores.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug activation strategies should be fast and high yielding. However, in strain&#8208;promoted alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release, a fast click&#8208;step translates to slow and inefficient drug release. To improve drug yield, branched dual&#8208;core scaffolds that increase drug release are reported. The dual&#8208;core consists of an exposed electron&#8208;deficient aryl azide (core&#8208;1) attached to an electron&#8208;rich self&#8208;immolating branched linker (core&#8208;2). Core&#8208;1, a tetrafluoroaryl azide with methyl&#8208;substitution at the benzylic carbon, facilitates a rapid click reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCOs). Core&#8208;2 had an N&#8208;methyl carbamate or ether linker and a 1,4/1,4&#8208; or 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating scaffold. Various release rates of a fluorophore were observed across the series, with 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating core&#8208;2, linked via the N&#8208;methyl carbamate, having sustained and enhanced fluorophore release. The second&#8208;order rate constant for cycloaddition of this 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating analogue and d&#8208;TCO is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest to date (22.0 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). A persistent intermediate was observed, leading to a long, sustained release of fluorophore from the branched scaffold, though activation under acidic conditions (pH&#160;=&#160;5.5) led to&#160;&#8776;&#160;15% higher fluorophore release compared to activation at pH 7.4. Therefore, combinations of core&#8208;1 and core&#8208;2 could improve future pretargeted in vivo bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug strategies, especially in the acidic tumor environment.

         <dc:description>
Two electronically and sterically modulated Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) have been synthesized. Thorough investigation of the catalytic efficiency of the synthesized complexes demonstrates excellent catalytic performance for the selective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols through HA. The results highlight the emergent role of Mn&#8208;salen complexes in &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions.








Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols has been systematically investigated using two distinct phosphine&#8208;free manganese&#8208;complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) bearing tetradentate Salen ligands. Remarkably, the complex Mn&#8208;ph with an aromatic imine bridge was found to be efficient in comparison to Mn&#8208;en, leading to an excellent yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone with good selectivity under operationally convenient conditions. Interestingly, a wide range of aromatic, cyclic, and heterocyclic ketones are effectively alkylated under the optimized reaction conditions. Notably, the transformation proceeds via an environmentally benign and atom&#8208;efficient pathway, generating water as the sole byproduct. The control experiments reveal the involvement of dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogen autotransfer (HA) pathway. These findings highlight the potential of Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes in catalytic HA processes, expanding their applications in sustainable C&#160;&#9472;&#160;C bond formation strategies.

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potential&#8208;Enabled Discovery of Chlorofullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work introduces a DFT&#8208;accurate machine learning potential for the C&#8211;Cl system, enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP accurately reproduces various experimentally known chlorofullerenes and uncovers structural and stability correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives, offering theoretical insights into chlorofullerene formation.








Abstract
Chlorination is an effective method for stabilizing fullerenes with pentagon adjacencies, transforming reactive sp2 carbon sites into sp3 hybridization to release local strain and reorganize orbital and spin distributions. Yet, the immense variety of fullerene isomers and their diverse chlorination sites pose significant challenges for accurate structural prediction. This study introduces a density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;accurate machine learning potential (MLP) for the C&#8208;Cl system, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP precisely replicates a range of experimentally identified chlorofullerenes and establishes correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives in terms of structural features and stability, offering theoretical insights into the formation principles of chlorofullerenes.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Radical Polar Crossover Route to 1,4&#8208;Keto Carboxylates Mediated by Anchimeric Assistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we developed an electrochemical method for 1,4&#8208;dioxygenated compounds, offering broad scope, functional group compatibility, and diastereoselectivity.








Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylate scaffold is present in the structure of many biologically relevant compounds. To date, there are only a branch of methods to prepare them, using either transition metal catalysts, or noncommercially available and sensitive starting materials. Herein, we describe a sustainable electrochemical methodology starting from commercially available and highly stable 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenes to prepare 1,4&#8208;keto aryl and alkyl carboxylates in a highly efficient manner, without the need of an external catalyst or harsh reaction conditions. This electrochemical oxidative radical polar crossover transformation presents a broad scope, is compatible with many functional groups, and can even be applied in flow chemistry. In addition, the key stabilization of the intermediate carbocation by anchimeric assistance allows a high diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control of the reaction. Moreover, the utility of these 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylates was demonstrated in several derivatizations and applications in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Aggregation Mechanisms, and Morphological Properties of Asymmetric Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric PDI derivatives, bearing similar OEG chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate changes in hydrophobicity on the properties of the resulting SMPs in solvent mixtures. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with increasing hydrophobicity. Tuning molecular structure leads to tuneable self&#8208;assembled structures and mechanisms of assembly.








Abstract
The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.

         <title>Fluorinated Trimers for Enhancing the Stability and Solubility of Organic Small Molecules Without Spectral Shifts: Ultrastable Ultraviolet Absorbers for Transparent Polyimide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design strategy employing a fluorinated phenyl linker to trimerize small molecules was validated using a model small molecule (Tinuvin 327 UV absorber). The resulting trimer (F&#8208;TPBT) showed greatly enhanced thermal stability and solubility with minimal spectral change. This strategy provides significant insight into the rational design of highly stable molecules for commercial optical applications.








Abstract
The development of highly stable organic small molecules for optical applications is of growing interest. Multimerization of monomeric small molecules can enhance stability via increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but it often reduces solubility and induces undesirable spectral shifts due to &#960;&#8208;extension. To overcome this trade&#8208;off, we report a trimeric small molecule (F&#8208;TPBT) derived from a model monomer (Tinuvin 327) using a 1,3,5&#8208;fluorinated phenyl linker. This design markedly improves thermal stability and solubility while minimizing changes in the optical absorption spectrum. F&#8208;TPBT shows superior thermal properties (5 wt% decomposition temperature&#160;=&#160;427&#160;&#176;C; weight loss after 1&#160;hour at 300&#160;&#176;C&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;wt%) and excellent solubility (5.3 wt% in dichloromethane; 6.4 wt% in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP)), with an absorption spectrum nearly identical to that of Tinuvin 327. These properties make F&#8208;TPBT a promising UV light absorber for transparent polyimide (TPI) films, which require processing above 300&#160;&#176;C and are widely used in flexible displays. Notably, F&#8208;TPBT&#8208;containing films retain their absorption properties even after 80&#160;hours of accelerated UV irradiation, demonstrating excellent photostability. This study presents a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules while avoiding significant spectral shifts.

         <title>Nitrile Hydroboration by Cooperative Iron Catalysis: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the Fe&#8208;catalyzed double hydroboration of nitriles using HBpin as the terminal reductant. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal a unique and unreported mechanistic pathway for iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration where reductive elimination, rather than B&#9472;H bond activation is the rate&#8208; limiting step.








Abstract
Reductive amination is a challenging reaction in catalysis that often gives poor yield and selectivity. We present an iron&#8208;catalyzed approach of synthesizing amines through reduction of nitriles through hydroboration with good yield under ambient conditions. Our detailed mechanistic study establishes the factors that influence the selectivity and turnover. The kinetics and mechanism of the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of benzonitrile to bis(boryl)benzylamine have been investigated by initial rates, temperature dependence, kinetic isotope effects, and computational studies. In contrast to other iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrile hydroboration, this study reveals that B&#9472;H bond activation is not rate&#8208;determining. Moreover, the rate&#8208;determining step was revealed to be C&#9472;H bond reductive elimination with an equilibrium isotope effect in operation. Through this combined approached, an Fe(0)/(II) catalytic manifold proceeding via metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity has been determined.

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen for Targeted Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ApApt is a light&#8208;up probe designed for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer cells. It combines AIEgen with the aptamer SYL3C to specifically target EpCAM&#8208;positive cancer cells. Upon aptamer&#8208;EpCAM binding, ApApt emits strong fluorescence due to the restricted intramolecular motion of AIEgens. This activation enables efficient ROS generation for targeted PDT under light irradiation, offering a precise approach for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising noninvasive treatment for cancer and other diseases. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers are excellent candidates for enhancing the efficacy of image&#8208;guided PDT due to their unique properties. DNA&#8208;modified AIE luminogens (AIEgens) offer an effective approach for nucleic acid detection and biospecies sensing, but their applications in tumor cell imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT have been rarely reported. Herein, we designed a light&#8208;up probe, named ApApt, for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT of cancer cells. The probe was prepared by conjugating AIEgen with aptamer and displayed specific targeting ability to EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)&#8208;positive cancer cells. ApApt exhibits good water solubility and shows very low emission in aqueous solution. However, it emits strong fluorescence as a result of the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) activation of AIEgens, which is triggered by the specific binding between the aptamer SYL3C and EpCAM protein. Upon delivery to cancer cells, ApApt efficiently generates ROS for targeted PDT under light irradiation.

         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion, and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, supported by scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional theory, we have investigated metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins on Cu(111). We furthermore compare our results with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin on Cu(111).








Abstract
Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyltransdisbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzoporphyrin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo), and tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000&#160;K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111).Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room temperature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373&#160;K. N&#160;1&#160;s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398&#160;K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely breaking up at 423&#160;K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950&#160;K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface.Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by ligand&#8208;assisted re&#8208;precipitation approach. Incorporating ICA ligand in place of long chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of non&#8208;radiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518 nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75 &#177; 2% to 94 &#177; 2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue from Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO2 has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO2 under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting carbon nanospheres (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO2&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO2 from ~3.2 eV to 2.91 eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over six&#8208;cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst&#8217;s stability and reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization For Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid phase synthesis of disaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN  &#960; &#8208;Conjugation and Aryl  &#963; &#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X = F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R = C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 was investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. DFT calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on resonance 1H free induction decays, 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated to the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
