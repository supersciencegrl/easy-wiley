         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine diazo reagents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several hypervalent iodine diazo reagents were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo reagents have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, hypervalent iodine diazo reagents can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of hypervalent iodine diazo compounds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration and Solvent&#8208;Induced Chiral Tuning by Manipulating Non&#8209;Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Glycoconjugate Supra&#8208;Scaffolds: Interaction with Protein, and Streptomycin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral tuning of the fibrous assemblies of two novel glycoconjugates Z&#8208;P(Gly)&#8208;Glu and Z&#8208;F(4&#8208;N)&#8208;Glu made by chemical attachment of Cbz&#8208;protected [short as Z)] non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine [short as P(Gly)] and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine [short as F(4&#8208;N)] with D&#8208;glucosamine [short as Glu]. Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4 nm.&#160; After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Activation of Drug (Derivative) Molecules with Pd(ll) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianions. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and in melts by direct fusion of the reactants yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms. The [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical (QC) calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.</dc:description>

In with the old: Perylene diimide, one of the oldest electron acceptors, was functionalized with group&#8197;14 elements in the bay position. The influence of these substitutions on their properties and performance in organic photovoltaics was thoroughly studied.







Abstract
Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused&#8208;ring non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis. In these molecules, the semimetals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to unsubstituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide&#8208;based solar cells recorded to date.

Combining anion photoelectron spectroscopy with quantum chemistry computations, it was determined that the C2Al4&#8722; cluster adopts a boat&#8208;like structure, whereas a D3h isomer is the most stable structure for C2Al5&#8722;.







Abstract
The study of C2Al4&#8722;/0 and C2Al5&#8722;/0 was conducted using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The present findings reveal that C2Al4&#8722; has a boat&#8208;like structure, with a single C2 unit surrounded by four aluminum atoms. In contrast, the neutral C2Al4 species adopts a D2h planar structure with two planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) units, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the global minimum isomer of C2Al5&#8722; adopts a D3h symmetry, where the C2 unit interacts with five aluminum atoms. It was also found that a lower symmetry structure of C2Al5&#8722;, where all five aluminum atoms are located on the same side of the C2 unit, albeit slightly higher in energy compared to the D3h structure. These computations show that the D3h structure of C2Al5&#8722; is highly stable, exhibiting a large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical strategy for synthesizing imines efficiently is introduced, including both symmetric and unsymmetric imines. Of note, the method is successfully applied to perform the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues, highlighting its potential in chemical biology applications. This strategy presents a convenient platform for imine synthesis with broad implications in drug development and organic synthesis.







Abstract
A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in the photoelectrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.

The introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the cycle of carbonate species and the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst of BiOCl play a significant role in this process. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of Cl2 production via photocatalysis.







Abstract
As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8211;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine by using solar energy and NaCl solution offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, it was found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.

In addition, compounds 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S also have good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap.







Abstract
The combination of chirality and phase&#8208;transition materials has broad application prospects. Therefore, based on the quasi&#8208;spherical theory and the thought strategy of introducing chirality, we have successfully synthesized a pair of chiral enantiomeric ligands (R/S)&#8208;triethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl)ammonium iodide, which can be combined with a tin hexachloride anion to obtain a pair of new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase&#8208;transition materials: (R/S)&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which have a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384&#8197;K, crystallize in the P21 chiral space group at room temperature, and have obvious CD signals. In addition, compounds 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S have a good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap. This work is conducive to the research into chiral high&#8208;temperature reversible plastic phase&#8208;transition materials, and promotes the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials.

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;Oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, CBPy and DAPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. The photo&#8208;oxidase activity of molecular rotors was applied for the colorimetric detection of environmental temperatures for the first time.







Abstract
Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes have been synthesized by fusing BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures. All the fused compounds have helical structures and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes show superior optical properties and high singlet&#8208;oxygen generation capacities that increase proportionally with their twisting angle.







Abstract
Designing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for the efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) that is proportional to their twisting angle. But their difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile in the visible spectral region restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT. On the other hand, boron&#8208;containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for their outstanding optical properties. However, planar BODIPY dyes has low ISC and thus they are not very effective as PDT agents. We have designed and synthesized fused compounds containing both BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures to develop red&#8208;shifted chromophores with efficient ISC. One of the pyrrole units of the BODIPY core was also replaced by a thiazole unit to further enhance the triplet conversion. All the fused compounds have helical structure, and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The helical structures of the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT structure optimization. The designed BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. This is the first report on the relationship between the twisting angle and the ISC efficiency in twisted BODIPY&#8208;based compounds. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances the ISC rate in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene, which is responsible for their high generation of singlet oxygen. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated, and one BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene showed efficient cancer cell killing upon photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for the future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes were hydration under bench type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents) thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium.

An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones has been developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/Gly (3&#8201;:&#8201;1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i)&#8197;under mild (45&#8201;&#176;C) and bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (air); and ii)&#8197;in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30&#8197;min, and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated by simply decanting the liquid FeIII&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle the FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to eight consecutive times. Furthermore, the FeIII&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the possibility of recycling this system up to three consecutive times. Preliminary investigations into a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seem to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alkynes were hydration under bench type reaction conditions&lt;/b&gt; (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co-catalysts or co-solvents) thanks to the use of a sustainable Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-based deep eutectic solvent (&lt;i&gt;DES&lt;/i&gt;) as promoter/reaction medium. This Fe-&lt;i&gt;DES&lt;/i&gt; was recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any &lt;i&gt;VOC&lt;/i&gt; solvent.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Free, Self&#8208;Repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors</title>

A liquid&#8208;free polyurethane type ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) was prepared in a facile manner. The mechanical robust, transparent ICE with self&#8208;healing ability proved its advantages in strain and temperature sensing. The recycling and remolding process did not deteriorate the sensing properties







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid&#8208;free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE&#8208;2) was synthesized and studied. The PU type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE&#8208;2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE&#8208;2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &gt;89&#8201;%, 400~800&#8197;nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06&#8197;MPa, elongation at break of 1760&#8201;%, and fracture energy of 14.98&#8197;kJ/m2), appreciable self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency &gt;90&#8201;%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE&#8208;2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro&#8208;expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Co&#8208;initiators via Base&#8208;Catalysed Sequential Conjugate Addition: Application in Photoinduced Radical Polymerisation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of a co&#8208;initiator for a type&#8208;II photoinitiator promoted photoinduced radical polymerzation reaction via a barrierless catalytic sequential conjugate addition reaction. The computational study confirms the presence of a low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap for the newly developed addition reaction. The 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol&#8208;based co&#8208;initiator turned out to be very efficient for the polymerization and the resultant polymeric material has excellent physical properties for dental restoration and 3D&#8208;printing.







Abstract
Applications of photochemistry are becoming very popular in modern&#8208;day life due to its operational simplicity, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable nature in comparison to thermochemistry. In particular photoinduced radical polymerisation (PRP) reactions are finding more biological applications and especially in the areas of dental restoration processes, tissue engineering and artificial bone generation. A type&#8208;II photoinitiator and co&#8208;initiator&#8208;promoted PRP turned out to be a cost&#8208;effective protocol, and herein we report the design and synthesis of a new efficient co&#8208;initiator for a PRP reaction via a barrierless sequential conjugate addition reaction. Experimental mechanistic observations have been further complemented by computational data. Time for newly synthesised 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol (DTH) based co&#8208;initiator promoted polymerisation of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, 70&#8201;%) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, 30&#8201;%) in presence of 450&#8197;nm LED (15&#8197;W) under the aerobic conditions is 38&#8197;seconds. Polymeric material has high glass transition temperature, improved mechanical strength (860 BHN) and longer in&#8208;depth polymerisation (3&#8197;cm).

         <title>A Bifunctional Coordination&#8208;Chain&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Framework for Quantitative Enantioselective Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers through a cation exchange reaction, with promising application for instant and quantitative enantioselective luminescence recognition. The competitive absorption and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer processes contribute cooperatively to the luminescence changes, while the chiral cations that selectively interact with targeting chiral molecules lead to the enantioselective recognition property.







Abstract
Enantioselective sensing is highly crucial and challenging due to the highly similar physical/chemical properties of enantiomers which may have different chemical impact on organism. Luminescent coordination compounds have attracted great attention as sensing materials based on their controllable chemical and electric structures that can be highly matched with the targeted species. To achieve high&#8208;performance enantioselective sensing, the direct synthesis of chiral and luminescent bifunctional coordination compounds is a rational way but highly challenging due to the price and synthesis difficulty. Herein, an anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied as a host to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers via a facile cation exchange reaction, affording a bifunctional framework that possesses enantioselective sensing properties for the mixture of enantiomers. This study paves a pathway for constructing multifunctional coordination chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for rapidly enantioselective sensing function.

         <title>Neighboring&#8208;Group Participation by C&#8208;2 Acyloxy Groups: Influence of the Nucleophile and Acyl Group on the Stereochemical Outcome of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neighboring&#8208;group participation by C&#8208;2 acyloxy groups can control the 1,2&#8208;trans stereoselectivity of acetal substitution reactions with the employment of strong nucleophiles. 1,2&#8208;Trans selectivity increases with decreased electron&#8208;donating ability of the acyloxy groups at C&#8208;2.







Abstract
A single acyloxy group at C&#8208;2 can control the outcome of nucleophilic substitution reactions of pyran&#8208;derived acetals, but the extent of the neighboring&#8208;group participation depends on a number of factors. We show here that neighboring&#8208;group participation does not necessarily control the stereochemical outcome of acetal substitution reactions with weak nucleophiles. The 1,2&#8208;trans selectivity increased with increasing reactivity of the incoming nucleophile. This trend suggests the intermediacy of both cis&#8208;fused dioxolenium ions and oxocarbenium ions in the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step. In addition, as the electron&#8208;donating ability of the neighboring group decreased, the preference for the 1,2&#8208;trans products increased. Computational studies show how the barriers for the ring&#8208;opening reaction on the dioxolenium ions and the transition states to provide the oxocarbenium ions change with the electron&#8208;donating capacity of the C&#8208;2&#8208;acyloxy group and the reactivity of the nucleophile.

     alt="Neighboring-Group Participation by C-2 Acyloxy Groups: Influence of the Nucleophile and Acyl Group on the Stereochemical Outcome of Acetal Substitution Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring-group participation by C-2 acyloxy groups can control the 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; stereoselectivity of acetal substitution reactions with the employment of strong nucleophiles. 1,2-&lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt; selectivity increases with decreased electron-donating ability of the acyloxy groups at C-2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single acyloxy group at C-2 can control the outcome of nucleophilic substitution reactions of pyran-derived acetals, but the extent of the neighboring-group participation depends on a number of factors. We show here that neighboring-group participation does not necessarily control the stereochemical outcome of acetal substitution reactions with weak nucleophiles. The 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; selectivity increased with increasing reactivity of the incoming nucleophile. This trend suggests the intermediacy of both &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-fused dioxolenium ions and oxocarbenium ions in the stereochemistry-determining step. In addition, as the electron-donating ability of the neighboring group decreased, the preference for the 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; products increased. Computational studies show how the barriers for the ring-opening reaction on the dioxolenium ions and the transition states to provide the oxocarbenium ions change with the electron-donating capacity of the C-2-acyloxy group and the reactivity of the nucleophile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards sequence/size defined macrocycles: Here we demonstrate a non&#8208;nucleic acid templated synthesis of peptide macrocycle complexes. By using hydrazone bonds, we template and organize short peptide oligomers along a solid supported peptide strand and cyclize them using microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis to form sequence and size defined macrocycles. The products are then released from the solid support via acidic hydrolysis and detected by LC&#8211;MS.







Abstract
The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.

         <title>Temporal Control of Fluorescent EuW10 Aggregates for Autonomous DNA Capture and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH&#8208;responsive C12DMAO endow EuW10 nanospheres with dynamical properties, in which fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent nanospheres provide new application in time&#8208;programmed information encryption.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly exploits noncovalent interaction to offer an effective method for the fabrication of materials. For Na9[EuW10O36]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;32H2O (EuW10), the negative charges and abundant oxygen atoms on its surface provide a handle for static self&#8208;assembly. New properties are envisioned for EuW10 aggregates which are able to display such kinetics and time&#8208;programming characteristics, in order to satisfy more complex and intelligent application scenarios, such as DNA binding and information encryption. In this work, EuW10 coupling with stimuli&#8208;responsive dodecyl dimethylamine oxide (C12DMAO) can generate versatile aggregates with pH&#8208;responsive properties. We demonstrated the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH clock reaction endows EuW10 assemblies with dynamical properties, in which the charges and fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent assemblies provide new application in time&#8208;programmed DNA capture and information encryption.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin (2) was stereoselectively synthesized from aldehyde 1, which was in turn obtained from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol and (&#8722;)&#8208;menthone. An attempted functionalization at position C5 remained futile, although several C&#8722;H activation methods could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide (3).







Abstract
The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2&#8201;% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic twofold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low yielding (10&#8201;%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.

         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins were prepared through a Heck&#8208;based cascade reaction and a Scholl reaction. An unusual trend was observed in the florescence quantum yield upon converting benzoporphyrin 2VTP to naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrin (F2VTP). NICS analysis revealed different impacts of the two isomeric naphthodithiophenes on the global aromaticity upon fusion to porphyrin (F2VTP and F3VTP).







Abstract
The fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulating their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade of steps followed by the Scholl reaction. The naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to a ~20% increase in the fluorescence lifetime, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than two&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#981;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#981;=0.13) with a concomitant ~30&#8201;% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behavior suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno&#8208;system mainly affects the radiative rate constant in the Q&#8208;state deactivation pathway, where the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208; versus naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts analysis revealed a considerable difference between the aromaticities of these two isomeric systems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.

In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (&lt;b&gt;F3VPT)&lt;/b&gt; results in a ~1.5-fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#981;&lt;/i&gt;=0.13) with a concomitant ~30&#8201;% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behavior suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno-system mainly affects the radiative rate constant in the Q-state deactivation pathway, where the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b&#8217;]dithiophene- versus naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b&#8217;]dithiophene-fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, nucleus-independent chemical shifts analysis revealed a considerable difference between the aromaticities of these two isomeric systems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred molecular recognition of aromatics in spherical M12L8 metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) has been studied in consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions combining single&#8208;crystal&#8208;XRD (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis, DFT calculations, and solid&#8208;state NMR. Computed DFT host&#8211;guest energy interactions (Ehost&#8211;guest) showed a good match with the observed molecular recognition and the rotational behaviour of the pyridine rings in the M12L8 nanocages (low rotational energy barrier &#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Considering the structure&#8211;function properties observed in M12L8, the metal&#8211;organic structures could be used in sensing applications.







Abstract
In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8211;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.&#8201;e., spherical) M12L8 MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported. The guest absorption was monitored directly in the solid&#8208;state by consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas&#8208;solid environment, in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. The preferential guest uptake was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8211;guest interaction energy (Ehost&#8211;guest) with a nitrobenzene (NB)&#8811;p&#8208;xylene (p&#8208;xy)&#8811;o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) trend (i.&#8201;e., from 44 to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC&#8208;XRD, DFT and solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M12L8 cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties were rationalized by considering the presence of mechanical bonds (efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine's rotor&#8208;like behaviour (with 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8211;function properties of M12L8 makes 1 a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>

Negatively charged 2H&#8208;MoS2: The surface of 2H&#8208;MoS2 was activated by reacting liquid exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 with NaBH4 yielding a novel anionically charged semi&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional 2H&#8208;MoS2 defined as n&#8208;2H&#8208;MoS2. The negative doping allowed for dispersibility in water and other polar solvents (unlike pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2), caused a red&#8208;shift in the material's photoluminescence, and allowed for facile functionalisation.







Abstract
The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950;=&#8722;25&#8197;mV and a 20&#8197;nm (0.05&#8197;eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material's spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Enabled Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing protocols for the boryl radical promoted dehydroxylative alkylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives via C&#8722;O bond cleavage require the use of expensive radical initiators and relatively harsh conditions. An improved protocol is presented that uses cheap and readily available sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4) as a boron radical source. The reaction using the photoredox catalytic system could take place under mild conditions and avoid tedious preparation of free radical initiator (di&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxydiazene).







Abstract
A novel visible&#8208;light photoredox strategy is reported for the efficient dehydroxylative alkylation of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives using diaryl boron radical. The reaction features readily accessible starting materials, broad substrate scope with excellent functionality tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the spin&#8208;center shift process is responsible for the C&#8722;O bond activation, which is promoted by the diaryl boron radical generated from bench&#8208;stable and commercially available tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4).

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare Cq(Cq)4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centrohexaindane is an unusual molecule that has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Vibrational spectroscopy was used to explore the differences between the solution and solid state structures.







Abstract
The structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1, was investigated. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000&#8197;&#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Centrohexaindane&lt;/b&gt; is an unusual molecule that has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene unit. Vibrational spectroscopy was used to explore the differences between the solution and solid state structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, was investigated. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X-ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Rise of Structurally Anisotropic Plasmonic Janus Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars without templates or masks is reported. The study explores structurally Janus nanostructures with two distinct morphologies and a single&#8208;step growth process using pentatwinned seeds. The interplay of silver and bromide ions influences morphological differences. The SERS capability of Au Janus NSs was investigated; higher enhancement was shown with larger&#8208;sized particles.







Abstract
Nanostructures intrinsically possessing two different structural or functional features, often called Janus nanoparticles, are emerging as a potential material for sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars (NSs) possessing a smooth concave pentagonal morphology with sharp tips and edges on one side and, contrastingly, a crumbled morphology on the other. The methodology reported herein for their synthesis &#8211; a single&#8208;step growth reaction &#8211; is different from any other Janus nanoparticle preparation involving either template&#8208;assisted growth or a masking technique. Interestingly, the coexistence of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;index facets was found in these Janus NSs. The general paradigm for synthesizing gold Janus NSs was investigated by understanding the kinetic control mechanism with the combinatorial effect of all the reagents responsible for the structure. The optical properties of the Janus NSs were realized by corelating their extinction spectra with the simulated data. The size&#8208;dependent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of these Janus NSs was studied with 1,4&#8208;BDT as the model analyte. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations for differently sized particles revealed the distribution of electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots over the particles resulting in enhancement of the SERS signal in a size&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding on the proton conductivity of COFs was investigated. It was shown that the extrinsic proton carriers could increase the proton conductivity of DaTta, which originally had negligible proton conductivity due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, to 0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#8201;&#176;C/98&#8201;% RH by breaking the intramolecular H&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta)&lt;&#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) under 100&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.

With light excitation, triplet oxygen molecules (3O2; red dots) are converted to singlet oxygen (1O2; blue dots) through triplet photosensitization by the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene (BHH) molecule. The researcher is trying to increase the twist angle of BHH. As it increases, the stick indicating the percentage of 1O2 conversion moves towards 100. This illustrates how 1O2 conversion increases with increasing BHH twist angle, which is the main highlight of the work. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Mula and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301605).

         <title>Front Cover: FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds (Chem. Eur. J. 57/2023)</title>

Thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium, alkynes were hydrated under bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents). This Fe&#8208;DES could be recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent (E factor = 10). Furthermore, the Fe&#8208;DES is able to promote the efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the system being recycled up to three consecutive times. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Presa&#8197;Soto, V. del&#8197;Amo, J. Garc&#237;a&#8208;&#193;lvarez, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301736).

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Luminescent Dyes: From Theoretical Insight to Experimental Evidence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ESPT, or not to ESPT: Efficient use of luminescent dyes requires understanding their excitation and relaxation pathways like Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT). Experimental demonstration is challenging due to competing phenomena. A holistic approach, merging experimental results, computational analysis, and diverse mechanism assessment, is vital for ESPT verification, affecting molecular probes, sensors, and related applications.







Abstract
The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes&#8242; shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis and Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Strained Carbo&#8208; and Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;organic synthesis has become an established and environmentally benign tool for initiating chemical transformations. This review summarizes the electrochemical synthesis and ring&#8208;opening reactions of three&#8208;membered strained rings, and particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis with biological importance. Moreover, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings leads to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization through C&#8208;&gt;C, C&#8208;&gt;N, and C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods for these molecules require the use of acid catalysts or transition metals. Recently, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.

         <title>Bioinspired Non&#8208;Heme Mn Catalysts for Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Oxyfunctionalizations with H2O2</title>

Mn catalyzed C&#8208;H activation: In recent years, Mn based catalysts have been at the forefront of direct oxidative functionalization of organic compounds with hydrogen peroxide. This contribution surveys the progress in this emerging area, achieved in the past five years, with focus on the possibilities for tuning the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity of these catalyst systems.







Abstract
In recent years, metalloenzymes&#8208;mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H2O2. To date, non&#8208;heme manganese complexes with chiral bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp3)&#8208;H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non&#8208;heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non&#8208;traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme&#8208;like substrate recognition&#8208;based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C&#8208;H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5&#8197;years (late 2018&#8211;2023).

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, metalloenzymes-mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy-to-handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To date, non-heme manganese complexes with chiral &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-amino-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo- and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non-heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non-traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme-like substrate recognition-based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C-H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5&#8197;years (late 2018&#8211;2023).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cage&#8208;Shaped Phosphites Having C3&#8208;Symmetric Chiral Environment: Steric Control of Lewis Basicity and Application as Chiral Ligands in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Additions</title>

         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites were developed as a new type of chiral ligand. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.







Abstract
Designing chiral ligands with an axial symmetry higher than C2&#8208;rotational symmetry is one of the most crucial approaches to improving enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites are reported. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.

         <title>&#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry for the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide with Phosphorus Dendrons: Synthesis, Characterization and Preliminary Biological Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several dendrons were functionalized on their surface by different types of pyridine&#8208;imine functions, and at their core by either azide or alkyne. These dendrons were grafted to graphene oxide (GO) via &#8220;click&#8221; reactions between azide or alkyne at their core, and alkynes or azides on the surface of GO, respectively. The biological properties of these new materials were tested.







Abstract
Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified&#8208;GO and GO&#8208;dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to GO were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non&#8208;cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.

         <title>Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals: Luminous Renaissance of a Class of Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have experienced a renaissance from a synthetic heterocyclic peculiarity as a short dipole with strong push&#8208;pull characteristics to a promising class of dyes with pronounced controllable and tunable solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, thus allowing for a methodical and synthetical extension of the system.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals represent a peculiar class of heterocyclic merocyanines, compounds bearing pronounced and rather short dipoles with great push&#8208;pull characteristics that define their rich properties. They are accessible via a wide array of synthetic concepts and procedures, ranging from addition&#8208;elimination and condensation procedures up to rearrangement and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. With our work from 2020, aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have been identified as powerful and promising dyes with pronounced and vastly tunable solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. One characteristic trademark of this class of dye molecules is the level of control that could be exerted, and which was thoroughly explored. Based on these results, the field was opened to extend the system to bi&#8208; and multichromophoric systems by the full toolkit of synthetic organic chemistry thus giving access to even more exciting properties and manifolded substance libraries capitalizing on the AIE properties. This review aims at outlining the reaction&#8208;based principles that allow for a swift and facile access to aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, their methodical and structural evolution and the plethora of fluorescence and aggregation properties.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Hexapyrrolylbenzenes: Exploring Charge&#8208;Transfer Phenomena in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Propellers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexapyrrolylbenzenes bearing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor pyrrole units undergo charge transfer upon irradiation. It is most efficient between ortho&#8208;positioned donors and acceptors, for which it can occur even in non&#8208;polar solvents, but it will also take place between para&#8208;substituents in more polar media.







Abstract
A family of propeller&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor hexapyrrolylbenzenes (HPBs) were designed and synthesized by sequential nucleophilic substitution of hexafluorobenzene with &#960;&#8208;extended pyrroles. In particular, four hybrids were obtained, containing various combinations of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor acenaphthylene&#8208;fused pyrroles. Additionally, to probe the efficiency of ortho transfer interactions, a system was designed containing unique donor and acceptor subunits spatially separated with four unfunctionalized pyrroles. DFT calculations showed propeller&#8208;shaped geometries of all HPB molecules and separation of frontier molecular orbitals between donor and acceptor subunits. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements revealed charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character of the emission with strong positive dependence on solvent polarity. The principal CT pathway involves ortho&#8208;positioned pairs of donors and acceptors and requires bending of the acceptor in the excited state.

         <title>Single Crystals of Insoluble Porous Salicylimine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of three barely soluble triptycene based porous organic cages have been obtained and their crystal packing as well as gas sorption properties elucidated. The relation between crystallinity, porosity and gas adsorption selectivity was revealed for these porous structures.







Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) are meanwhile an established class of porous materials. Most of them are soluble to a certain extend and thus processable in or from solution. However, a few of larger salicylimine cages were reported to be insoluble in any organic solvents and thus characterized as amorphous materials. These cages were now synthesized as single&#8208;crystalline materials to get insight into packing motifs and preferred intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the pairs of crystalline and amorphous materials for each cage allowed to compare their gas&#8208;sorption properties in both morphological states.

         <title>Spin Qubit in a 2D GdIIINaI&#8208;Based Oxamato Supramolecular Coordination Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diamagnetically diluted two&#8208;dimensional oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIII&#8208;based complex is shown to be a good candidate for molecular qubits, and its near isotropy of GdIII ion and the phonon bottleneck effect from resonance phonon trapped were calculated and fitted to be responsible for the field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation, relatively long spin&#8208;lattace and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times.







Abstract
Qubits are the basic unit of quantum information and computation. To realize quantum computing and information processing, the decoherence times of qubits must be long enough. Among the studies of molecule&#8208;based electron spin qubits, most of the work focused on the ions with the spin S=1/2, where only single&#8208;bit gates can be constructed. However, quantum operations require the qubits to interact with each other, so people gradually carry out relevant research in ions or systems with S&gt;1/2 and multilevel states. In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIIINaI&#8208;based oxamato supramolecular coordination framework, Na[Gd(4&#8208;HOpa)4(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (1, 4&#8208;HOpa=N&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenyloxamate), was selected as a possible carrier of qubit. The field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation shows this system has phonon bottleneck (PB) effect at low temperatures with a very weak magnetic anisotropy. The pulse electron paramagnetic resonance studies show the spin&#8208;lattice and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times are T1=1.66&#8197;ms at 4&#8197;K and Tm=4.25&#8197;&#956;s at 8&#8197;K for its diamagnetically diluted sample (1Gd0.12&#8201;%). It suggested that the relatively long decoherence time is mainly ascribed to its near isotropic and the PB effect from resonance phonon trapped for pure sample, while the dilution further improves its qubit performance.

         <title>Enabling Stereochemical Communication and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chiroptical Properties in Biphenyl&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221; is challenging for the construction of chiroptical materials, as they often lack chromophores suitable for significant chiroptical properties. A two&#8208;level molecular stack, which combines a point&#8208;chiral element (cyclodextrin) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), is capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in the cyclodextrin core into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Chiroptical materials are gaining increasing interest due to their innovative character and their applications in optoelectronics and data encryption technologies. Fully harnessing the potential of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221;, such as native cyclodextrins (CDs), as they often lack chromophores suitable for the construction of materials with significant chiroptical properties. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a two&#8208;level molecular stack consisting of a point&#8208;chiral element (CD) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in CDs into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;permethylated CDs were efficiently capped with two different 2,2&#8217;&#8208;difunctionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl units. In CD derivatives containing the rigid 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl cap, two intramolecular hydrogen bonds act synergistically as stereoselective actuators, enabling effective communication between the two levels and the transfer of nonchromophoric stereochemical information from the cyclic&#8208;oligosaccharide to the atropoisomeric cap. The chiroptical properties can be finely tuned by external stimuli such as temperature and solvent. The way chirality is transferred from the CD platform to the biphenyl cap was revealed thanks to crystallographic and computational analyses, together with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Polymers Without Conventional Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A discrete, boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a&#160; neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) was demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14 mA mg&#8211;1Pt) and stability (317.69 mA mg&#8211;1 Pt after 2 h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;-&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well-dispersed MoS2. By using the N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) was demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14 mA mg&#8211;1Pt) and stability (317.69 mA mg&#8211;1 Pt after 2 h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs-isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS2 holds large half-wave potential (0.88 V) and high stability (92.71% after 22 h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;-&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet-isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles to apply in other fields of energy as well as the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of bridged tetrazoles with promising properties and potential applications by a one&#8208;step Finkelstein reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop.Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) where investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, allowing to diminish MDA content below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were therefore synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Milling Medium&#8208;Free Suzuki Coupling by Direct Mechanocatalysis: From Mixer Mills to Resonant Acoustic Mixers
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't LAG behind: Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding can compensate for the absence of milling balls in direct mechanocatalysis by adjusting the rheology. The LAG sweet spot is the same for resonance acoustic mixer and ball&#8208;free mixer mills, thus facilitating a smooth transfer from one method to the other. The new catalyst system maintains its high activity for over 20 reactions with negligible Pd contamination.







Abstract
Here we describe the development of a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective approach for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions in mechanochemistry. It is found that the substrate&#8216;s impact with the vessel wall alone is sufficient to initiate the reaction, thus indicating that milling balls function primarily as a mixing agent for direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki coupling. The absence of milling balls can be offset by adjusting the rheology using liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG). The LAG sweet spot of 0.25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1 is confirmed for both resonance acoustic mixers (RAMs) and ball&#8208;free mixer mills, and is higher than in the presence of milling balls. RAMs exhibit excellent performance in the Suzuki reaction, achieving yields of 90&#8201;% after 60&#8197;min and complete conversion after 90&#8197;min. The longevity of the milling vessel is significantly improved in a RAM, allowing for at least 20 reactions without deterioration.

         <title>From One&#8208;dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal Coordination Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8208;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8208;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8208;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. The surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity&#160;of CO2 reduction. Herein, the hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3% and the current density achieves 23.8 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;2.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30 wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65 wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5 wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6 mA cm&#8208;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85% at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#181;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#181;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8211;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8208; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8208;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100 mM Cl&#8208; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8208; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8208; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8208; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Niobium&#8208;Based Oxide for Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of  small  organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Graphene Oxide: Unveiling Structural Properties and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Between the sheets: The Intercalation&#8208;Exfoliation (I&#8208;E) method was successfully applied to produce graphene oxide (GO) materials with adjustable oxidation levels, defect density, and crystallite size by tuning applied potential and electrolyte concentration. Investigating the electrochemical properties of these GO samples via CV and EIS measurements with a selected redox probe establishes meaningful correlations between their structural features and performance.







Abstract
An electrochemical exfoliation method for the production of graphene oxide and its characterization by electrochemical techniques are presented here. Graphite rods are used as working electrode in a three&#8208;electrode electrochemical cell, and electro&#8208;exfoliation is achieved by applying anodic polarization in a sulfuric acid solution. The electrochemical process involved two steps characterized by an intercalation at lower potential and an exfoliation at higher potential. The electrochemical behavior of the produced GO is studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X ray Photoelectronic Spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize the structural and chemical properties of the exfoliated GO. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical exfoliation method yields GO materials with varying degrees of oxidation, defect density, and crystallite size, depending on the applied potential and acid concentration. The graphene oxide samples exhibited distinct electrochemical properties, including charge transfer resistance, interfacial capacitance, and relaxation times for the charge transfer, as revealed by CV and EIS measurements with a specifically selected redox probe. The comprehensive characterization performed provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of the GO materials synthesized through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite.

Red&#8208;y, steady, drop: Molecular syringe is a peptide&#8208;derived photochromic hydrogel that can be loaded with cargo and then release the guest when biocompatible red light illuminates it under physiological conditions.







Abstract
Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels are versatile materials that show macroscopic effects upon irradiation, like liquefaction or shape changes. Here, we demonstrate a simple photochromic cyclic dipeptide (2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine&#8208;based) supergelator, composed of (S)&#8208;lysine and an azobenzene analogue of phenylalanine, that forms supramolecular hydrogels even at 0.1&#8197;wt% loading. The gels can physically encapsulate cargo molecules and release them to the environment in a controllable manner upon irradiation with red light, thus working as a &#8220;molecular syringe&#8221;. As the material is biocompatible and operational in the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221; of light (&gt;650&#8197;nm) that deeply penetrates soft human tissues, it is applicable to smart drug&#8208;delivery systems.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Metathesis for the Synthesis of Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis has been developed to construct &#947;&#8208;butenolides and related naturally occurring compounds, featuring the concurrent formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a ketone group in 100&#8201;% atom economy.







Abstract
Alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis is a type of carbon&#8208;carbon forming reaction involving the construction a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a carbonyl group in one transformation. Herein, a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis protocol has been developed to make densely substituted &#947;&#8208;butenolides from propargyl &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. It features 100&#8201;% atom economy, excellent substrate flexibility and benign functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the coordinative interaction between the gold catalyst and the alkyne might initiate the transfer of an oxygen atom and the formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. By using this gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis as a key step reaction, four naturally occurring butenolide&#8208;type compounds including decumbic acid (45&#8201;% yield for 3&#8197;steps), deoxyisosporothric acid (32&#8201;% yield for 5&#8197;steps), lichesterinic acid (34&#8201;% yield for 5&#8197;steps) and isomuronic acid (6&#8201;% yield for 8&#8197;steps) have been synthesized starting from commercially available starting materials.

         <title>Dipolarophile&#8208;Steered Formal Stereodivergent Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans&#8208;Pyrrolidines Based on Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formal diastereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines was achieved by using a different type of activated alkenes. The silver complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of imino lactones with ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones, and subsequent transformation afforded chiral pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans diastereoselectivity. In contrast, 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines were obtained by the reaction of imino lactones with acyclic enones.







Abstract
The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and enantioselectivities. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics approach for non&#8208;linear polyphosphates: Pull&#8208;down probes of non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, were developed to explore the elusive interactome of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. Application to yeast cell extracts provided datasets of potential interactors. In addition, condensation reactions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates were studied in this work.







Abstract
Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring&#8208;sizes of meta&#8208; or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate&#8208;analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring&#8208;contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P4O112&#8722;, was selectively obtained and then ring&#8208;opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution using a Nickel&#8208;based Calixpyrrole Complex: Controlling the Secondary Coordination Sphere on an Electrode Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel calixpyrrole complex with pendant amine groups is reported, which forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. Turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900&#8197;s&#8722;1 or 366,000&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were observed and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was found to be rate&#8208;limiting.Twitter usernames: SuesGroup







Abstract
Incorporating design elements from homogeneous catalysts to construct well defined active sites on electrode surfaces is a promising approach for developing next generation electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions. Furthermore, if functionalities that control the electrode microenvironment could be integrated into these active sites it would be particularly appealing. In this context, a square planar nickel calixpyrrole complex, Ni(DPMDA) (DPMDA=2,2&#8242;&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)bis(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5,2&#8208;diyl))bis(methaneylylidene))bis(azaneylylidene))dianiline) with pendant amine groups is reported that forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. The supported Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was surprisingly stable and displayed fast reaction kinetics with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900&#8197;s&#8722;1 or 366,000&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies revealed a KIE of 5.7, and this data, combined with Tafel slope analysis, suggested that a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was rate&#8208;limiting. While evidence of an outer&#8208;sphere reduction of the Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was observed, it is hypothesized that the control over the secondary coordination sphere provided by the pendant amines facilitated such high TOFs and enabled the PCET mechanism. The results reported herein provide insight into heterogeneous catalyst design and approaches for controlling the secondary coordination sphere on electrode surfaces.

         <title>Access to Chiral O,O&#8208;Acetals Enabled by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Addition of Oximes to Alkoxyallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of oximes and alkoxy allenes enables the access to enantiomerically pure O,O&#8208;acetals, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxy allene is decisive for the high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure acyclic O,O&#8208;acetal compounds (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;ee) have been accessed through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of oximes to alkoxyallenes. DFT calculations support that a protonative hydropalladation pathway is favourable, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxyallene is critical for the highly stereoselective formation of the dioxygenated stereogenic center.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;photolysis of two simple N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium complexes with H2 proceeds in one case under cooperative addition of H2 across the P=Mn double bond and in the other case via decarbonylation without participation of H2. The origin of this divergence and preliminary results on the passing on of the H2 molecule to styrene are discussed.







Abstract
The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP=N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776;4&#8197;bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5&#8201;a, R=Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6&#8201;a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5&#8201;b, R=Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7&#8201;b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7&#8201;a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7&#8201;b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7&#8201;a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that 5&#8201;a/H2 as well as 6&#8201;a enable the photo&#8208;induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Modulated FeSe/C Anode Materials for High&#8208;Stable and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO layer on electrode exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC, DEC, and K+&#8208;ions, regulating the EDL around electrode. The special behavior changes the SEI and markedly improves the reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, rGO with robust mechanical properties remains the integrity of SEI and FeSe/C@rGO electrode. Under these synergies, the anode exhibits excellent potassium storage properties.







Abstract
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity. However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086&#8201;% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1.

Under these synergies, the anode exhibits excellent potassium storage properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity. However, the impact of rGO on the electrode-electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 300 cycles, along with excellent long-term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086&#8201;% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phenothiazinone as Fluorophore and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of phenothiazinone via oxidative cyclocondensation of quinone and 2&#8208;aminothiophenol under mild condition is presented, along with its bio&#8208;application as fluorophore for lipid droplets imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Phenothiazinone is a promising yet underutilized fluorophore, possibly due to the lack of a general accessibility. This study reports a robust and scalable TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrochemical method to access a variety of phenothiazinones from 2&#8208;aminothiophenols and quinones. The electrosynthesis proceeds in a simple cell architecture under mild condition, and notably carbon&#8211;halogen bond in quinones remains compared to conventional methods, enabling orthogonal downstream functionalization. Mechanistic studies corroborate that TEMPO exerts a protective effect in avoiding product decomposition at the cathode. In particular, benzophenothiazinones show intriguing luminescence in both solid and solution state, and thus their photophysical properties are scrutinized in detail. Further bio&#8208;imaging of the lipid droplets in living cells highlights the considerable promise of benzophenothiazinones as fluorescent dye in the biomedical fields.

         <title>Dispersing LiCl in Zwitterionic COF for Highly Efficient Ammonia Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic covalent organic frameworks (COF) is proposed as a porous hosts to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation. The anionic and cationic groups in zwitterionic COF act as two separated positive and negative charged sites to facilitate the dispersion of lithium chloride, which makes LiCl doped zwitterionic COF exhibit excellent NH3 capture performance.







Abstract
Efficient and inherently safe NH3 storage and separation are of significant importance for the chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as a porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98&#8197;mmol/g at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH3 from NH3/CO2/N2 mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and 7Li&#8197;NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH3 storage and separation.

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100 g/mol) and yield (&gt;70%) are achieved under mild conditions (30 &#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5 &#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5 &#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>New protocol for the synthesis of S&#8208;thioesters from benzylic, allylic and tertiary alcohols with thioacetic acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#181;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4].

         <title>Cold Plasma for Green Advanced Reduction/Oxidation Processes (AROPs) of Organic Pollutants in Water
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasma activation: These extremely reactive milieux attack any organic compound, including the most refractory environmental pollutants, leading to their mineralization. Depending on the specific target, suitable plasma sources can be developed for best performance. Cold plasmas offer the promise of novel technologies for PFAS degradation in water under ambient conditions using only (green) energy.







Abstract
Cold plasma is gaining increasing attention as a novel tool to activate energy demanding chemical processes, including advanced reduction/oxidation processes (AROPs) of organic pollutants in water. The very complex milieu generated by discharges at the water/plasma interface comprises photons, strong oxidants and strong reductants which can be exploited for achieving the degradation of most any kind of pollutants. Despite the complexity of these systems, the powerful arsenal of mechanistic tools and chemical probes of physical organic chemists can be usefully applied to understand and develop plasma chemistry. Specifically, the added value of air plasma generated by in&#8197;situ discharge with respect to ozonation (ex situ discharge) is demonstrated using phenol and various phenol derivatives and mechanistic evidence for the prevailing role of hydroxyl radicals in the initial attack is presented. On the reduction front, the impressive performance of cold plasma in inducing the degradation of recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl substances, which do not react with OH radicals but are attacked by electrons, is reported and discussed. The widely different reactivities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) underline the crucial role played in these processes by the interface between plasma and solution and the surfactant properties of the treated pollutants.

The widely different reactivities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) underline the crucial role played in these processes by the interface between plasma and solution and the surfactant properties of the treated pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Triptycene Hexacarboxylate Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas&#8208;Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of zinc MOF, Zn&#8208;X2Trp and Zn&#8208;X2PET (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et, Pr), with difunctionalized triptycene&#8208;hexacarboxylate ligands H6X2Trp and H6X2PET that differ in size have been synthesized. All of these Zn&#8208;MOFs show high thermal stability as well as H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities. Moreover, MOFs with smaller pore size showed higher H2 and CO2 adsorption. Thus, the introduction of methyl, chloro, and bromo substituents at the bridgehead positions of the triptycene ligands enhances the H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on zinc ions and two triptycene ligands of different size have been synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Structural analyses revealed that they are isostructural 3D&#8208;network MOFs. The high porosity and thermal stability of these MOFs can be attributed to the highly rigid triptycene&#8208;based ligands. Their BET specific surface areas depend on the size of the triptycene ligands. In contrast to these surface&#8208;area data, the H2 and CO2 adsorption of these MOFs is larger for MOFs with small pores. Consequently, we introduced functional groups to the bridge&#8208;head position of the triptycene ligands and investigated their effect on the gas&#8208;sorption properties. The results unveiled the role of the functional groups in the specific CO2 binding via an induced interaction between adsorbates and the functional groups. Excellent H2 and CO2 properties in these MOFs were achieved in the absence of open metal sites.

         <title>Aluminium and Gallium Silylimides as Nitride Sources
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal aluminium and gallium silylimides have been accessed for the first time by exploiting the oxidative reactions of anionic aluminium(I)/gallium(I) (&#8216;aluminyl&#8217;/&#8217;gallyl&#8217;) reagent with silylazides. These compounds feature minimal M=N &#960;&#8208;bonding and can be shown to act as sources of the nitride ion, [N]3&#8722; in reactions with CO or N2O.







Abstract
Terminal aluminium and gallium imides of the type K[(NON)M(NR)], bearing heteroatom substituents at R, have been synthesised via reactions of anionic aluminium(I) and gallium(I) reagents with silyl and boryl azides (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;anilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene). These systems vary significantly in their lability in solution: the N(SiiPr3) and N(Boryl) complexes are very labile, on account of the high basicity at nitrogen. Phenylsilylimido derivatives provide greater stabilization through the &#960;&#8208;acceptor capabilities of the SiR3 group. K[(NON)AlN(SitBuPh2)] offers a workable compromise between stability and solubility, and has been completely characterized by spectroscopic, analytical and crystallographic methods. The silylimide species examined feature minimal &#960;&#8208;bonding between the imide ligand and aluminium/gallium, with the HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 orbitals effectively comprising orthogonal lone pairs centred at N. Reactivity&#8208;wise, both aluminium and gallium silylimides can act as viable sources of nitride, [N]3&#8722;, with systems derived from either metal reacting with CO to afford cyanide complexes. By contrast, only the gallium system K[(NON)Ga{N(SiPh3)}] is capable of effecting a similar transformation with N2O to yield azide, N3&#8722;, via formal oxide/nitride metathesis. The aluminium systems instead generate RN3 via transfer of the imide fragment [RN]2&#8722;.

         <title>Beryllium&#8208;Mediated Halide and Aryl Transfer onto Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring opening of hexamethylcyclotrisoloxane with BeBr2, BeI2 and BePh2 was observed. These reactions yielded previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates, [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4] and [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4], respectively, as well as [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. Hydrolysis of these beryllium silanolates revealed that dimethyl bromo and iodo silanol are unstable and react to various cyclic cyclosiloxanes.







Abstract
The reactivity of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3) towards BeCl2, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6]3 was investigated. While BeCl2 only showed unselective reactivity, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6] cleanly react to the trinuclear complexes [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4], [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4] and [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. These unprecedented bromide, iodide and phenyl transfer reactions from a group II metal onto silicon offer a versatile access to previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates.

         <dc:description>Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts in aqueous solution. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n = 6, 8, and 10) yoked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m = 2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2mTACN&#183;Zn2+ was lowered by ~1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#183;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Covalent organic frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts towards ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us to achieve the catalysts&#8217; properties previously, and build the structure&#8211;property relationship at molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal free electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, and well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospective for design and construction high electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of 3D synthetic scaffolds for neuronal tissue engineering applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold's mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel&#8217;s biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel&#8217;s ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The "carbohydrate chemical mimicry" exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylydenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannoligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated "in line" heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.</dc:description>

Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers are highly sought after for light&#8208;mediated applications, such as photoredox catalysis, depollution and energy conversion schemes. Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. This study reports a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited&#8208;state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (108&#8211;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica&#8208;supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited&#8208;state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Quantum Dots as Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Emitting Species for Sensitive Detection of KRAS G12C Mutation via PET&#8208;RAFT

         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) synthesized from different ratios of carbon and nitrogen sources have been systematically explored for their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties for the first time. And NGQDs as signal molecules combined with photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy to construct a ECL biosensor for sensitive detection of KRAS G12C mutation was first reported.







Abstract
The levels of KRAS G12C point mutation is recognized to be closely related to the earlier diagnosis of non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, based on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) and photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy, we fabricated a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for the detection of KRAS G12C mutation for the first time. NGQDs as ECL&#8208;emitting species with cathodic ECL were prepared by a simple calcination method. Firstly, KRAS G12C mutation DNA, i.&#8201;e., target DNA (tDNA), was captured by specific identification with hairpin DNA (hDNA). Then, PET&#8208;RAFT was initiated by blue light, and large numbers of monomers were successfully polymerized to form controllable polymer chains. Lastly, massive NGQDs was introduced via amidation reaction with N&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMA), which significantly amplified the ECL signal intensity. Under optimal conditions, this biosensor achieved a good linear relationship between ECL intensity and logarithm of the levels of KRAS G12C mutation in the range from 10&#8197;fM to 10&#8197;nM. Moreover, this strategy exhibited high selectivity and excellent applicability for KRAS G12C mutation detection in the serum samples. Therefore, this biosensor has great potential in clinical diagnosis and practical application.

         <title>Slow Magnetization Relaxation in a Family of Triangular {CoIII2LnIII} Clusters: The Effect of Diamagnetic CoIII Ions on the LnIII Magnetic Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of heterometallic complexes, [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln=Tb (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)), possessing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core, have been prepared; compounds 2 and 3, as well as the magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95} (2&#8201;a), behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with Ueff up to ~90&#8197;K.







Abstract
The first use of the Schiff base chelate N&#8208;naphthalidene&#8208;o&#8208;aminophenol (naphH2) in Co/Ln chemistry has afforded a family of isostructural [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln=Tb, Dy and Er) complexes, revealing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core composed of two diamagnetic CoIII ions and a 4f&#8208;ion with slightly distorted square antiprismatic geometry. Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that {Co2Dy}, and its magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95}, behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with similar energy barriers for the magnetization reversal, Ueff, of ~85&#8208;90&#8197;K. SMM properties were also detected for {Co2Er}, with the compound exhibiting a Ueff of 18.7&#8197;K under an applied magnetic field of 800&#8197;Oe. To interpret the experimental magnetic results, ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO and DFT calculations were performed as a means of exploring the single&#8208;ion characteristics of LnIII ions and comprehend the role of the diamagnetic CoIII ions in the magnetization relaxation of the three heterometallic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates by Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis of partially fluorinated alkyl triflates and nonaflates by using electrochemical fluorination (ECF) has been developed; it provides access to CF3SO2OCH2F and CF3SO2OCHF2 as well as their deuterated analogs. Selected ethyl triflates and nonaflates are also accessible through ECF.







Abstract
A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro&#8208; and difluoromethyl triflate CF3SO2OCH2F (MH2F) and CF3SO2OCHF2 (MHF2) through electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) of methyl triflate MH3 in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is presented. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF3SO2OCD2F (MD2F) and CF3SO2OCDF2 (MD2F). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF3SO2OCD3 (MD3); this provides further evidence for a NiF3/NiF4&#8208;mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described, and electrochemical fluorination of CF3SO2OCH2CF3 (EH2F3) leads to the until now unknown chiral CF3SO2OCHFCF3 (EHFF3). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible by ECF. This study contains detailed spectroscopic, structural, and thermal data on (fluoro)methyl and fluoro(ethyl) triflates.

         <title>Synthesis of Photochromic Phosphines by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reaction of Alkynes Bearing Phosphinyl Substituent with a Silacyclopropene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodological approach for the preparation of unconventional DTE&#8208;based photochromic phosphines is reported. It relies on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a silirene.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphines with light controlled basicity is presented in this study. A methodological approach for the preparation of these unconventional photochromic phosphines based on a dithienylethene organic moiety is reported. It relies on the palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a 2,3&#8208;Dithienylsilacyclopropene. Accordingly, a diphenyphosphino moiety is connected to the organic photochrome thanks to different linkers. Their influence on the photochromism and on the phosphinyl group basicity is studied and evaluated based on experimental an NMR descriptor as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Tailoring the CO2 Hydrogenation Performance of Fe&#8208;Based Catalyst via Unique Confinement Effect of the Carbon Shell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured Fe&#8208;based catalyst Na&#8722;Fe3O4@C with confinement effect delivered higher productivity of light olefins compared with the naked Na&#8722;Fe2O3 counterpart. Multiple characterization and DFT calculation verified that the timely carbon chain&#8208;growth termination, as well as unique CO2/H2 ratio and electronic property on the catalytic interface played vital roles in boosting light olefins synthesis.







Abstract
Even though Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been widely employed for CO2 hydrogenation into hydrocarbons, oxygenates, liquid fuels, etc., the precise regulation of their physicochemical properties is needed to enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, under the guidance of the traditional concept in heterogeneous catalysis&#8208;confinement effect, a core&#8208;shell structured catalyst Na&#8722;Fe3O4@C is constructed to boost the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Benefiting from the carbon&#8208;chain growth limitation, tailorable H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic interface, and unique electronic property that all endowed by the confinement effect, the selectivity and space&#8208;time yield of light olefins (C2=&#8722;C4=) are as high as 47.4&#8201;% and 15.9&#8197;g&#8201;molFe&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which are all notably higher than that from the shell&#8208;less counterpart. The function mechanism of the confinement effect in Fe&#8208;based catalysts are clarified in detail by multiple characterization and density functional theory (DFT). This work may offer a new prospect for the rational design of CO2 hydrogenation catalyst.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Reduction of Disulfides in an Undivided Cell under Mass Transfer Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reductive cleavage of disulfides has been accomplished without the need for sacrificial metal anodes or a divided cell. Excellent conversion and selectivity toward the corresponding thiol can be achieved by tuning the current density at the electrodes. Very high current density at the anode creates a mass transfer barrier that impedes re&#8208;oxidation of the thiol generated at the cathode.







Abstract
Electroorganic synthesis is generally considered to be a green alternative to conventional redox reactions. Electrochemical reductions, however, are less advantageous in terms of sustainability, as sacrificial metal anodes are often employed. Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.

         <title>Reductive Activation of Aryl Chlorides by Tuning the Radical Cation Properties of N&#8208;Phenylphenothiazines as Organophotoredox Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photons are better than one: Intramolecular charge transfer in the intermediate radical cation of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines as photocatalysts improves the yields for borylation and phosphonylation of aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Aryl chlorides as substrates for arylations present a particular challenge for photoredox catalytic activation due to their strong C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bond and their strong reduction potential. Electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, as organophotoredox catalysts, are capable of cleaving aryl chlorides simply by photoinduced electron transfer without the need for an additional electrochemical activation setup or any other advanced photocatalysis technique. Due to the extremely strong reduction potential in the excited state of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines the substrate scope is high and includes aryl chlorides both with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substituents. We evidence this reactivity for photocatalytic borylations and phosphonylations. Advanced time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry was the key to elucidating and comparing the unusual photophysical properties not only of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, but also of their cation radicals as the central intermediates in the photocatalytic cycle. The revealed photophysics allowed the excited&#8208;state and radical&#8208;cation properties to be fine&#8208;tuned by the molecular design of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines; this improved the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Arylazoisoxazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxazoles are introduced as an additional scaffold to the existing arylazoheteroarenes and open the door for tailor&#8208;made properties in molecular and materials chemistry. They were found to combine excellent photochromic behavior with long thermal life times. Supramolecular aggregates were formed by host&#8211;guest interaction and gelation.







Abstract
Azoheteroarenes are emerging as powerful alternatives to azobenzene molecular photoswitches. In this study, water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxazole photoswitches are introduced. UV/vis and NMR spectroscopy revealed moderate to very good photostationary states and reversible photoisomerization between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers over multiple cycles with minimal photobleaching. Several arylazoisoxazoles form host&#8211;guest complexes with &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin with significant differences in binding constants for each photoisomer as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR experiments, indicating their potential for photoresponsive host&#8211;guest chemistry in water. One carboxylic acid functionalized arylazoisoxazole can act as a hydrogelator, allowing gel properties to be manipulated reversibly with light. The hydrogel was characterized by rheological experiments, atom force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These results demonstrate that arylazoisoxazoles can find applications as molecular photoswitches in aqueous media.

         <title>Improved Catalytic Performance toward Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohols Originated from New Open&#8208;Framework Copper Molybdovanadate with a Unique V/Mo Ratio</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valent vanadium (V4+/V5+=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+=8/2) cations exhibits improved catalytic activity (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the complex (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C16H32C5H4N)+)] and could serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes.







Abstract
A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid open&#8208;framework molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valences of vanadium (V4+/V5+=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+=8/2) cations has been synthesized. The complex possesses the unique V/Mo ratio (7/10), fascinating 8&#8208;C topological network and 1D 4&#8208;MR channels (7.793&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.699&#8197;&#197;). Importantly, its catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (oxidant: H2O2, 30&#8201;wt&#8201;%) have been well evaluated. The results indicated that it exhibited improved catalytic activities (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the catalyst (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C16H32C5H4N)+)], high recyclability and structural stability. Moreover, the conversions and selectivities (conv.: 82.4&#8211;92.5&#8201;%; sele.: 91.5&#8211;95.7&#8201;%) of the substrates containing electron donating groups (&#8722;OH, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;OCH3 and &#8722;Cl) were significantly higher than those of the substrate containing electron withdrawing group (&#8722;NO2) (conv. 67.4&#8201;%; sele.: 80.8&#8201;%). This is due to the fact that the &#8722;NO2 with a large Hammett substituent constant is not conducive to the generation of transition state products.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A copper molybdovanadate&lt;/b&gt; with mixed-valent vanadium (V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;=8/2) cations exhibits improved catalytic activity (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the complex (Cpyr)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)] and could serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new organic-inorganic hybrid open-framework molybdovanadate with mixed-valences of vanadium (V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;=8/2) cations has been synthesized. The complex possesses the unique V/Mo ratio (7/10), fascinating 8-C topological network and 1D 4-MR channels (7.793&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.699&#8197;&#197;). Importantly, its catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (oxidant: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 30&#8201;wt&#8201;%) have been well evaluated. The results indicated that it exhibited improved catalytic activities (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the catalyst (Cpyr)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)], high recyclability and structural stability. Moreover, the conversions and selectivities (conv.: 82.4&#8211;92.5&#8201;%; sele.: 91.5&#8211;95.7&#8201;%) of the substrates containing electron donating groups (&#8722;OH, &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &#8722;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8722;Cl) were significantly higher than those of the substrate containing electron withdrawing group (&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (conv. 67.4&#8201;%; sele.: 80.8&#8201;%). This is due to the fact that the &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a large Hammett substituent constant is not conducive to the generation of transition state products. The studies revealed the complex could act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfone/Carbonyl&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorescent Dyes: Synthesis, Structures, Photophysical Properties and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfone or carbonyl&#8208;based acceptor units were used to construct donor&#8208;acceptor conjugate organic fluorophores. Both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO have solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties for strong intramolecular charge transfer. As sulfone has weak intersystem crossing ability, TPA&#8208;SO has high fluorescence efficiency in solution and nanoparticles, and is a promising fluorescence dye.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;accepting units play vital roles in constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated organic optoelectronic materials; the electronic structures and functions of the acceptors need to be carefully unveiled to controllably tailor the optoelectronic properties. We have synthesized two D&#8208;A conjugated organic fluorophores, TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO, with similar molecular skeletons based on sulfone&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic acceptors. Both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO display obvious solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties and large Stokes shift of over 100&#8197;nm for strong intramolecular charge transfer processes. Experimental evidence indicates that the sulfone group in TPA&#8208;SO merely serves as a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing unit. TPA&#8208;SO shows yellowish&#8208;green emission with a peak at 542&#8197;nm and an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#8201;% in solution, whereas the carbonyl group in TPA&#8208;CO can act as both an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and spin transition convertor, so TPA&#8208;CO displays red emission with a low absolute PLQY of 0.32&#8201;% in solution. Impressively, upon going from solution to aggregate state, TPA&#8208;SO nanoparticles keep a high PLQY of 9.5&#8201;% and moderate biocompatibility, thus they are good nano&#8208;agents for cellular fluorescence imaging. The results reveal that the inherent acceptor characteristic acts as a crucial effect in the photophysical properties and applications of the organic fluorophores.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Improvement in Edge Roughness of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Using a Dummy Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled/living supramolecular polymerization has enabled the synthesis of well&#8208;defined nanostructures which are otherwise inaccessible under thermodynamically controlled, spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. Yet, there is still room for improvement; here we show two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization improved using an additive, which permits the synthesis of supramolecular nanosheets of better quality.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are formed through nucleation (i.&#8201;e., initiation) and polymerization processes, and kinetic control over the nucleation process has recently led to the realization of living supramolecular polymerization. Changing the viewpoint, herein we focus on controlling the polymerization process, which we expect to pave the way to further developments in controlled supramolecular polymerization. In our previous study, two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization was used to produce supramolecular nanosheets with a controlled area; however, these had rough edges. In this study, the growth of the nanosheets was controlled by using a &#8216;dummy&#8217; monomer to produce supramolecular nanosheets with smoothed edges.

         <title>Germanium(II) Dithiolene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry at the germylene and dithiolene interface has rarely been explored. Here, we report a series of Lewis base&#8208;coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complexes. Controlled hydrolysis of the carbene&#8208;coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complex affords a dianionic bis&#8208;dithiolene&#8208;based germanium(II) species.







Abstract
The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 reaction of the imidazole&#8208;based dithiolate (2) with GeCl2&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;dioxane in THF/TMEDA gives 3, a TMEDA&#8208;complexed dithiolene&#8208;based germylene. Compound 3 is converted to monothiolate&#8208;complexed (5) and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;complexed (7) germanium(II) dithiolene complexes via Lewis base ligand exchange. A bis&#8208;dithiolene&#8208;based germylene (8), involving a 3c&#8211;4e S&#8208;Ge&#8208;S bond, has also been synthesized through controlled hydrolysis of 7. The bonding nature of 3, 5, and 8 was investigated by both experimental and theoretical methods.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changes in the assembly of PtII complexes on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Under dry conditions, PtII complexes are attached to the LDH nanoparticles like starfish on the rocks, and exhibit a monomer&#8208;derived green emission. Under humid conditions, the mobility of PtII complexes increases due to the adsorption of water, like fish swimming among the rocks, resulting in an assembly&#8208;derived orange emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yoshida, M. Kato and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301993). Cover art by Hibiki Asahori.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale synthesis of cycloparaphenylene building blocks is illustrated. It represents the different syntheses in continuous flow and how the building blocks can be assembled. The final robotic arm allows aromatization to the macrocyclic CPP ring; the color change showing that all the phenyl units are now the same. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302173).

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the "rule of six" principle (six or more carbons on azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Review: Direct Lithium Extraction Using Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Worldwide lithium (Li) demand has surged in recent years due to increased production of Li&#8208;ion batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Li supply and production will need to increase such that the transition towards increased electrification in the energy sector does not become cost prohibitive. Many countries have taken policy steps such as listing Li as a critical mineral. Current commercial Li mining is mostly from dedicated mine sources, including ores, clays, and brines. The conventional ways to extract Li+&#160;from those resources are through chemical processing. The environmental and economic sustainability of conventional Li processing has recently received increased scrutiny. Routes such as direct Li+&#160;extraction may provide advantages relative to conventional Li+&#160;extraction technologies, and one possible route to direct Li+&#160;extraction includes leveraging of intercalation materials. Intercalation material processing has recently demonstrated high selectivity towards Li+&#160;as opposed to other cations. Reviews and reports of direct Li+extraction with intercalation materials are limited, even as this technology has started to show promise in smaller scale demonstrations. This paper will review selective Li+&#160;extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+&#160;in and out and efforts to characterize the Li+&#160;insertion/deinsertion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation with ketone selectivity by a cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo embedded in a &#946;&#8208;barrel protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. Here, we report the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8208; (X = Cl, Br; Me3TACD = N,N&#180;,N&#180;&#180;&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal = CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.</dc:description>

(6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;&#8208;insertion, (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuBpin.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although challenging, the distant C&#8208;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8208;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8208;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot process for the gem&#8208;difluoroolefination of amides is described. The reaction is based on interaction of generated in situ &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine. The olefination involves nucleophile&#8208;assisted dephosphorylation and proceeds within one hour at low temperature.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of an appropriate supersaturated solution as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of the protein molecule. We discuss problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor's electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density was set to 1 A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7 F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10 A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5 W/kg, an energy density of 22.1 Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material's microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.</dc:description>

The changed interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure realized the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. S&#8208;doping weakens the S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interaction in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which effectively improves the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting still face the problems of difficult low spontaneous polarization intensity and excessive carrier recombination. Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS&#8208;4 photoanode is as high as 0.574&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE, which is about 1.59&#8197;times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS &#8722;4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08&#8201;%. The first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S&#8208;doping leads to the weakening of S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interactions in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro&#8208;generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Theoretical Prediction of Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Using a 2D Catalyst Composed of 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Hexaamine Dipyrazino Quinoxaline</title>

Computational screening of 2D materials composed of 3d transition metal and hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxalineas efficient catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reactions.







Abstract
Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density&#8208;functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline(HADQ) were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM&#8208;HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. Cu and Co were less selective, producing HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4 simultaneously at the same rate&#8208;determining step and limiting potential. The Cu&#8208;HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022&#8197;V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016&#8197;V and 0.792&#8197;V. Thus, these results predict TM&#8208;HADQ to show excellent activity in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction and to become a promising electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Binary Metallic CuCo5S8 Anode for High Volumetric Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary metallic CuCo5S8 is successfully synthesized and evaluated as a CA&#8208;free anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Because of the metallic properties of the material, the CA&#8208;free anode exhibits superior rate and cyclic performances. The high electrode density and multi&#8208;electron transfer during the charge&#8208;discharge process enable CuCo5S8 anode to display an outstanding volumetric capacity.







Abstract
With the rapid improvement of compact smart devices, fabricating anode materials with high volumetric capacity has gained substantial interest for future sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) applications. Herein, a novel bimetal sulfide CuCo5S8 material is proposed with enhanced volumetric capacity due to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity of the material and multi&#8208;electron transfer during electrochemical procedures. Due to the intrinsic metallic behavior, the conducting additive (CA) could be removed from the electrode fabrication without scarifying the high rate capability. The CA&#8208;free CuCo5S8 electrode can achieve a high volumetric capacity of 1436.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 2000&#8197;cycles in SIBs, outperforming most metal chalcogenides, owing to the enhanced electrode density. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by combined measurements for sodium systems. The proposed new strategy offers a viable approach for developing innovative anode materials with high&#8208;volumetric capacity.

         <title>A Plant Dye for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free natural dye has been developed to selectively convert methane to methyl trifluoroacetate (CH3TFA) using visible light, probably due to the formation of a chloride&#8208;bridged dimer undergoing fast intra&#8208;complex charge transfer.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the Boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8208;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8208;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#949;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10 &#181;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within the zeolite micropores enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity, but is prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. By introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals, we characterize the pore space.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We use confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10 &#181;m-sized) zeolite-&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within the zeolite micropores enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J-aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity, but is prevented by using non-fluorescent spacer molecules. By introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite-&#946; crystals, we characterize the pore space. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of its diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite-&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we find a value of 3 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m2 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we visualize that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite-&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite sub-units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;modulated Reversible Clustering of Gold Nanorods Driven by Small Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors.&#160;To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest.&#160;Here, we showcase thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant.&#160;Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed us to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. Our findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8208;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8211;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaguanidino&#8208;Triptycenes and Triphenylenes: Electronic Coupling in Molecules Containing Three Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Diguanidinobenzene Units Connected either Directly or Interacting Through Homoconjucation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel redox&#8208;active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states were synthesized by connecting three o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycenes, the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C&#8208;C bonds to the sp3&#8208;hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triphenylenes they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic coupling between the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units, with homoconjugation being present in the triptycene, but not in the triphenylene compounds. Motivated by the appearance of an intense low&#8208;energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high&#8208;spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with a phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent is described. Reactivity studies reveal that they are capable of undergoing hydroelementation reactions across the E=P bond and of acting as masked phosphinidene sources.







Abstract
We describe the facile synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with the phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent, Me3P&#8722;PMes*. Their reactivity towards a range of substrates with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds (E=N, O, Si) is described. In addition to hydroelementation reactions of the E=P bonds, we show that these compounds, particularly [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn=PMes*, also act as base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes, allowing phosphinidene transfer to other nucleophiles.

         <title>Stable Dication Diradicals of Triply Fused Metallo Chlorin&#8208;Porphyrin Heterodimers: Impact of the Bridge on the Control of Spin Coupling to Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly stable, novel, triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers are reported in which the bridge is completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles. UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and ESI&#8208;MS investigations enabled us to identify some of the key reactive intermediates disclosing tentative mechanistic details of such an unusual transformation.







Abstract
We report an unexpected rearrangement, controlled by the nature of the bridge, leading to the formation of novel, remarkably stable triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers in excellent yields. Here, a dipyrromethene bridge gets completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles with two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;N bonds.

     alt="Stable Dication Diradicals of Triply Fused Metallo Chlorin-Porphyrin Heterodimers: Impact of the Bridge on the Control of Spin Coupling to Reactivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two highly stable&lt;/b&gt;, novel, triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin-porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers are reported in which the bridge is completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles. UV-vis, EPR, and ESI-MS investigations enabled us to identify some of the key reactive intermediates disclosing tentative mechanistic details of such an unusual transformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an unexpected rearrangement, controlled by the nature of the bridge, leading to the formation of novel, remarkably stable triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin-porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers in excellent yields. Here, a dipyrromethene bridge gets completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles with two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;N bonds. The two macrocycles exhibit extensive &#960;-conjugation through the bridge, which results in an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two &#960;-cation radicals. In addition, the macrocyclic distortion also favours a rare intramolecular ferromagnetic interaction between the Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and &#960;-cation radical spins to form a triplet state. The structural and electronic perturbation in the unconjugated dication diradical possibly enables the bridging pyrrolic nitrogen to undergo a nucleophilic attack at the nearby &#946;-carbon of the porphyrin &#960;-cation radical with a computed free energy barrier of &amp;gt;20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; which was supplied in the form of reflux condition to initiate such a rearrangement process. UV-vis, EPR and ESI-MS spectroscopies were used to monitor the rearrangement process in&#8197;situ in order to identify the key reactive intermediates leading to such an unusual transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Nitrides from Supramolecular Crystals: From Single Atoms to Heterojunctions and Advanced Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular single crystals based on C&#8722;N monomers are used to prepared carbon nitride materials with tailored morphology and porosity, single atom catalysts or heterojunctions. This approach can be applied to fabricate efficient water splitting photoelectrodes.







Abstract
Carbon nitride materials (CN) have become one of the most studied photocatalysts within the last 15&#8197;years. While CN absorbs visible light, its low porosity and fast electron&#8208;hole recombination hinder its photoelectric performance and have motivated the research in the modification of its physical and chemical properties (such as energy band structure, porosity, or chemical composition) by different means. In this Concept we review the utilization of supramolecular crystals as CN precursors to tailor its properties. We elaborate on the features needed in a supramolecular crystal to serve as CN precursor, we delve on the influence of metal&#8208;free crystals in the morphology and porosity of the resulting materials and then discuss the formation of single atoms and heterojunctions when employing a metal&#8208;organic crystal. We finally discuss the performance of CN photoanodes derived from crystals and highlight the current standing challenges in the field.

         <title>Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Double&#8208;Electron Transfer Between A Pair of Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Units Aligned by Dithiolate Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer in pairs: Intramolecular through&#8208;space electron transfer between an oxidized, dicationic and a reduced, neutral triguanidine unit is observed if the two units are preorientated by a dithiolate bridge.







Abstract
Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox&#8208;active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox&#8208;active units in close proximity. The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized. Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210&#8197;K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through&#8208;space electron&#8208;transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through&#8208;space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the counterions in opposite direction. The rate of double&#8208;electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron&#8208;transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through&#8208;space double&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.

         <title>Yttrium Complexes with Group 13 Heterobenzene&#8208;Type Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gallabenzene&#8208;type yttrium complex [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] (A) is readily formed from one&#8208;pot&#8208;reactions using mixtures [YMe3]n/GaMe3/K(2,4&#8208;dtbp) (2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl), while the remaining pentadienyl ligand gets easily displaced by pentamethylcyclopentadienyl affording B, showcasing the strong interaction of the heterobenzene ligand with the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal center. Distinct ligand bonding is revealed by 89Y&#8197;NMR chemical shifts.







Abstract
The yttrium gallabenzene complex [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] is accessible from Y(GaMe4)3 and K(2,4&#8208;dtbp) via a tandem salt metathesis/methane elimination (2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl). The pentadienyl ligand in [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] (E=Al, Ga) is easily displaced by salt metathesis with KC5Me5 and KTpMe,Me (TpMe,Me=tris(pyrazolyl&#8208;Me2&#8208;3,5)borato) affording [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(TpMe,Me)] and [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(C5Me5)]. The yttrium center in [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] readily forms adducts with neutral Lewis bases like 4&#8208;DMAP (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine), PMe3, DMPE (1,2&#8208;bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane), and DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane). In stark contrast, addition of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) results in methyl/pentadienyl exchange between aluminum and yttrium resulting in [(1&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dtbp)&#8208;1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Al)Y(Me)(tmeda)]. The bonding features of the newly synthesized complexes are analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and heteronuclear (89Y, 31P) NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State [4+4] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion with Use of Unpaired Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donors to Achieve Solvatomorphism and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state [4+4] cycloaddition of a commercially available anthracene derivative affords facile synthesis of a cycloadduct. The cycloaddition is reversible in the solid&#8208;state using heat or mechanical force. The cycloadduct is highly solvatomorphic due to presence of unused, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and is applied to the thermal stabilization of monomers.

The crystal structure of a commercially available anthracene derivative, anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;thiocarboxamide, is reported here for the first time. The compound undergoes a [4+4] cycloaddition in the solid state to afford facile synthesis of the cycloadduct (CA). The cycloaddition is also reversible in the solid state using heat or mechanical force. Due to the presence of unpaired, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donor atoms on the CA, significant solvatomorphism is achieved, and components of the solvatomorphs self&#8208;assemble into four different classes of supramolecular structures. The CA readily crystallizes with a variety of structurally&#8208;diverse solvents including those containing oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, or pi&#8208;acceptors. Some of the solvents the CA crystallized with include thiophene, benzene, and the three xylene isomers; thus, the CA was employed in industrially&#8208;relevant solvent separation. However, in competition studies, the CA did not exhibit selectivity. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the CA crystallizes with vinyl&#8208;containing monomers and is currently the only compound that crystallizes with both widely used monomers 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and styrene. Solid&#8208;state complexation of the CA with the monomers affords over a 50&#8201;&#176;C increase in the monomer's thermal stabilities. The strategy of designing molecules with unused donors can be applied to achieve separations or volatile liquid stabilization.

         <title>A Combination of B&#8208; and N&#8208;Doped &#960;&#8208;Systems Enabling Systematic Tuning of Electronic Structures and Properties</title>

B/N&#8208;codoped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were constructed via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction, and their electronic structures and optical properties could be effectively modulated via static and dynamic control of intramolecular charge transfer states.







Abstract
Doping heteroatoms into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their structures and thereby physical properties. This study reports the construction of B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction. Both feature a C48BN2 &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which is assembled by linearly fusing three substructures including B&#8208;doped and sp2&#8208;hybridized N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;moieties and one pyrene unit. In comparison to the pristine B&#8208;doped analog, their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states are distinctly modulated by the fused N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and the further incorporated cyano group, leading to their tunable optical properties, as revealed by detailed theoretical and experimental analysis. Furthermore, these three molecules have sufficient Lewis acidity and can coordinate with Lewis base to form Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts, and notably, such intermolecular complexation can further dynamically modulate their ICT transitions and thereby photophysical properties, such as producing blue, green and red fluorescence.

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins&#8722;An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8208;4526), herein we summarized total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8208;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, we compiled an update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 0.75 equiv of KOH, gave up to 33% yield of LA in 44% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93% LA with 96% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8208;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving&#160;molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.</dc:description>

Diradicals: Simple, modular and convergent access to diradicals with controllable S&#8722;T gap demonstrated with two examples.







Abstract
Reactions of a benzo[e][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di&#8208;Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4&#8208;phenylene or 1,3&#8208;phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one&#8208;electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3&#8197;V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps &#916;ES&#8208;T=2&#8197;J of &#8722;3.02(11) and &#8722;0.16(1)&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 1,3&#8208;phenylene derivatives, respectively. The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution. Results suggest a simple and efficient access to a family of stable Blatter diradicals with a controllable S&#8722;T gap through a judicious choice of the arylene coupling unit. DFT calculations indicate that the triplet state is stabilized by (het)arylenes with low LUMO.

         <title>Amorphous TiO2 shells: an Essential Elastic Buffer Layer for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Healing Eutectic GaSn Nano&#8208;Droplet Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eGaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell forms a stable SEI film, alleviates volume expansion, and provides electron/ion transport channels. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibit high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No obvious decay is observed in more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallium-based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core-shell structure of eGaSn@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NDs). The amorphous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell (~6.5&#8197;nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;C. In situ X-ray diffraction (in&#8197;situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy-based negative electrode materials for high-performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational design&#160;of a multifunctional benzothiadiazole derivative in organic photonics and electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8208;2 dB &#956;m&#8208;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8208;1 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, e.g. aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl a&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the unique role of water in the formation of benzothiazoles: an experimental and computational study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthus mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80 kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250 kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8208;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggests that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine free Mn(I)&#8208;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric effect of &#960; bridge in IDT&#8208;based nonfused electron photovoltaic acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, were designed and synthesized with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b']dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT&#8208;BFO, IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF:PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO:PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF based OSCs contributed to its lower PCE. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB&#8208;T:Y5 as control devices by adding 10% IDT&#8208;BFO exhibited a 5% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3% vs. 13.6%).</dc:description>

Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT-BOF and IDT-BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT-BFO, IDT-BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red-shifted absorption. However, IDT-BOF-based bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) coupled with PBDB-T, and PCE-10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT-BFO (PBDB-T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE-10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT-BOF:PBDB-T and IDT-BFO:PBDB-T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT-BOF based OSCs contributed to its lower PCE. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB-T:Y5 as control devices by adding 10% IDT-BFO exhibited a 5% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3% vs. 13.6%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling N2 to ammonia conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials: A new avenue in photocatalytic applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima&#8217;s initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of substrate conformation by hydrogen bonding in a retaining &#946;&#8208;endoglycosidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial &#946;&#8208;glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;&#8208;cellulose, &#946;&#8208;glucans and &#946;&#8208;xylans from different sources, which are used in a myriad of biomedical and industrial applications. It has been shown that a conformational change of the substrate, from a relaxed 4C1 conformation to a distorted 1S3/1,4B conformation of the reactive sugar, is necessary for catalysis. However, the molecular determinants that stabilize the substrate&#8217;s distortion are poorly understood. Here we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)&#8208;based molecular dynamics methods to assess the impact of the interaction between the reactive sugar, i.e. the one at subsite &#8208;1, and the catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) on substrate conformation. We show that the hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in an enzyme mutant) knocks it out. We also show that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro derivatives, widely used to trap the reaction intermediates by X&#8208;ray crystallography, reproduce the conformation of the hydrolysable substrate at the experimental conditions. These results highlight the importance of the 2&#8208;OH&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interaction in substrate recognition and catalysis in endo&#8208;glycosidases and can inform mutational campaigns aimed to search for more efficient enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;chain Ligands: Structural diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8211;P&#8211;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R&#160;=&#160;tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R&#160;=&#160;iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. Herein, we attach two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtain two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the enlarged conjugation as well as the electron withdrawing effects from the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes, and the spectroelectrochemistry investigation reveals the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0 = 0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to develop very stable diradicals and offers them opportunity of further applications in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework Modified with Thioamide Groups for Selective Extraction of Palladium from Strong Acid Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400 kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147 mg g&#8208;1), and excellent reusability in 4 M nitric acid. Moreover, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.</dc:description>

Moreover, COF-316-DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT-IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Propargylboration of Ketones with Allenyl&#8208;Bpins: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of tert&#8208;Homopropargyl Alcohols Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl&#8208;Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in&#8208;situ activation of stable allenyl&#8208;Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25 equiv. of nBuLi and the prerequisite 2.0 equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylpyrrole&#8208;Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole Extractant for the Fluoride and Chloride Anions</title>

Extractants: The diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole and its dual host systems involving crown ethers enable the extraction of various fluoride and chloride salts from water.







Abstract
The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722; as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20&#8201;% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.

         <title>2D Non&#8208;van der Waals Nanoplatelets of Hematene and Magnetene: Nonlinear Optical Response and Optical Limiting Performance from UV to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study reports that non&#8208;van der Waals 2D materials, hematene and magnetene, show very efficient optical limiting (OL) from UV to visible, with their optical limiting onset (OLon) values exhibiting a decreasing trend towards UV irradiation wavelengths. The obtained results render these materials very promising candidates for OL&#8208;related applications, such as the protection of human retinal from high&#8208;power laser.







Abstract
Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OLon), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer. The present findings open new possibilities for the potential use of these non&#8208;vdW 2D materials in photonics and optoelectronics, e.&#8201;g., as optical limiters and optical switchers.

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;Inorganic Ag&#8208;Based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, different dimensions of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) metal halides have been synthesized in different solvents, DMF and DMSO, respectively. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among four solvents (DMF, DMSO, DMAC, DMPU), we find the donor number plays the predominant role in the dimension tuning.







Abstract
Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46&#8201;% and 20.61&#8201;%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, DMAC, 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;Tetrahydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Human Milk Oligosaccharides: para&#8208;Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose and para&#8208;Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose</title>

Chemical synthesis of two common core human milk oligosaccharides&#8212;para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH)&#8212;using a convergent 3+3 approach has been reported.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i.&#8201;e. para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy was found to work best for obtaining these linear glycans.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Mono&#8208; and Dinuclear Boron Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If NHC&#8208;stabilized borenium ions [NHC&#8722;BH2]+ and [PF6]&#8722; take the same bus, they will get off neutralized and with a noticeable change, i.&#8201;e., as NHC&#8722;BF3 and PH2F3. However, if tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate is the second passenger, the anion remains untouched and a bis(boronium) or a bis(borenium) ion can enjoy the journey.







Abstract
The dinuclear bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) borane adduct 2 rapidly reacts with tritylium salts at room temperature but the outcome is strongly impacted by the respective counter&#8208;ion. Using tritylium tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate affords &#8211; depending on the solvent &#8211; either the bis(boronium) ion 4 or the hydride&#8208;bridged dication 5. In case of tritylium hexafluorophosphate, however, H/F exchange occurs between boron and phosphorus yielding the dinuclear BF3 adduct 3 along with phosphorus dihydride trifluoride. H/F exchange also takes place when using the mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene BH3 adduct 6 and hence provides a facile route to PH2F3, which is usually synthesized in more complex reaction sequences regularly involving toxic hydrogen fluoride. DFT calculations shed light on the H/F exchange between the borenium ion and the [PF6]&#8722; counter&#8208;ion and the computed mechanism features only small barriers in line with the experimental observations.

         <title>Controlling the Crystallisation and Hydration State of Crystalline Porous Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High throughput screening was used to rapidly identify a new crystalline porous salt (CPOS). Using flow chemistry, the CPOS was scaled, and the material was shown to have permeant porosity with a carbon dioxide uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous and scalable CPOS reported to date.







Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photo&#8208;Induced C&#8208;H Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;H, C(sp2)&#8208;H, and C(sp)&#8208;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8208;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.</dc:description>
