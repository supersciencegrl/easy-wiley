         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative&#8208;Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative&#8208;Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8208;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8208;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Mediated Cyclizations of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: an Easy Access to Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes (CP&#8208;anthracenes) through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of easily available triene&#8208;yne systems bearing a benzofulvene substructure, is reported. The targets are of great interest due to the potential use as organic materials, as well as in the field of biological chemistry and the preparation of these compounds is gaining huge importance. The applied starting materials are readily available through a 3&#8208;step synthesis, which further contributes to the advantages of this route. In addition, UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescent spectra of the obtained CP&#8208;anthracenes were recorded.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 electrolysis addressing the "alkalinity issue" and achieving high CO2 utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favorable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favorable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers' attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the "alkalinity problem" and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyramidal Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived FeP@CoP Aluminium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Displaying Low&#8208;Temperature Tolerance and Fast Electron Transfer Kinetics</title>

FeP@CoP nanorods derived from pyramidal metal organic frameworks were developed as aluminum&#8208;ion battery cathode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and fast electron transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite was developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode maintains a high capacity of 168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. These findings inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Dion&#8211;Jacobson Layered Perovskite Polymorphs of KWO3F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural relationship between the known normal&#8208;pressure modification of KWO3F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO3F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed&#8208;anion compounds.







Abstract
Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F are reported. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The structural relationship between&lt;/b&gt; the known normal-pressure modification of KWO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed-anion compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F are reported. A high-pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high-temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Feasible Strategy for a Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Over 900&#8201;nm Based on Phenalenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel NIR TADF organic emitters, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, were first designed and compared in parallel. Neat films of OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA present real NIR emission with peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1&#8208;phenalene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T1) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S1) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL performances in the TADF emitter&#8208;based NIR&#8208;OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.

         <title>Nms&#8208;Amides: An Amine Protecting Group with Unique Stability and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms&#8208;amides, initially developed through in silico studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.

In an effort to resolve this predicament, we herein present a new sulfonamide protecting group, which we term Nms. Initially developed through in silico studies, Nms&#8208;amides overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise. We have investigated the incorporation, robustness and cleavability of this group and found it to be superior to traditional sulfonamide protecting groups in a broad range of case studies.

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;Containing Fusicoccins</title>

14&#8208;3&#8208;3 isoforms and the elucidation of their biological roles: In vitro isoform&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; was achieved by a fusicoccin derivative containing a fluorophore and a Cys&#8208;directed acrylamide group. The reaction proceeds upon ternary complex formation with mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide, which possesses i+1 aliphatic residues.







Abstract
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; isoform was evaluated, which possesses a unique Cys38, and a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent was designed by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ER&#945;, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Direct C(3)5&#8722;H Polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;Amino/alkoxy Pyridines Enabled by a Transient and Electron&#8208;deficient Palladium Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transiently formed electrophilic polyfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species overrides the unproductive N&#8208;coordination enabling a remote selective polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines. The strategy allowed rapid construction of polyfluorinated heterobiaryls containing bioactive molecules and drug derivatives in good yields.







Abstract
Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method's utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) is based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation.







Abstract
Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules have been obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its infancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic phase strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work provides a way to design highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrogen&#8208;centered heptalene, azaheptalene, was designed as a representative of a new class of redox&#8208;responsive molecules with a large steric strain that originates from the adjacent seven&#8208;membered rings. The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono&#8208; and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near&#8208;infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P&#8208; or M&#8208;helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|gabs| &#8805; 0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free system, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, while the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of spin delocalization and proton transfer. This protocol is the first example of remote second alkylation on the aromatic ring via &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization and difunctionalization achieved by association of two unsaturated bonds in radical cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chirality transfer strategy was established to access enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates stereogenic only at the B&#8208;atom. First, a library of chiral boron O,N&#8208;complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate&#8208;complex into the boron C,N&#8208;chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl







Abstract
Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural analogous ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether&#8208;based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine&#8208;free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
Five new n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+ cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (Tg&lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li+ ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of the nitrogen in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi&#8208;based MOF (Bi&#8208;MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynes with EtOH as the green solvent was developed. Various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF3Se source.







Abstract
Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamer hairpin&#8208;like motifs have been prepared by connecting oligourea helices with various alkyl and aralkyl linkers, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Some specific geometrical parameters like interhelical dihedral angles and helical twists were measured, thus allowing precise comparison between the different supersecondary structures.

One cleavage &#8208; many possibilities: A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of enantiopure P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom&#8208;made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Unimolecular Reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; Complexes (R=Organyl): Stepwise versus Concerted Mechanism in Copper&#8208;Mediated Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations affords detailed insight into the reactivity of high&#8208;valent trifluoromethylated cuprate complexes. Depending on the nature of the organyl group R, these key intermediates of synthetically valuable trifluoromethylation reactions lose two radicals or undergo concerted reductive eliminations.







Abstract
The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R=organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, the potential energy surfaces of these systems are explored by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=Me, Et, Bu, sBu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8901;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8901; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8901;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.

This concept article provides new opportuinies of employing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid platforms to activate small molecules like hydrogen due to intrinsic sites in MOFs that behave as frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thus featuring new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis using MOFs as solid catalysts.New Opportunities in Metal&#8211;organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis (Garcia, Dhakshinamoorthy, and Asiri)







Abstract
This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10&#8197;bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Tin(II)&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Birefringence in SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new tin(II) phosphates SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2 exhibit enhanced birefringence by introducing the tin(II) ions with stereochemically active lone pairs. And in particular for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, the hydrogen groups facilitate more aligned Sn2+&#8208;centered oxygen polyhedra. Moreover, the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance measurement further indicates that their cut off edges are 262 and 263&#8197;nm, which can be used as a new UV birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Two new tin(II) phosphates, SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, were synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method and hydrothermal method, respectively. Theoretical study indicates that by introducing tin(II) with stereochemical activity lone pairs (SCALP) in metal phosphates, the birefringence was enhanced, 0.048@1064&#8197;nm for SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and 0.080@1064&#8197;nm for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2.

         <title>[2+4] Cycloaddition Product of an Amidinate Substituted Dialumene with Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient dialumene based on an amidinate scaffold was synthesized. The complex was isolated as a cycloaddition product with toluene. The mechanism of the reaction investigated using the DFT method indicates a free energy barrier of 0.9&#8197;kcal/mol with respect to the monomeric AlI intermediate.







Abstract
Reduction of LAlI2 (L=PhC(NiPr2C6H3)2) with two equivalents of KC8 in toluene affords the [2+4]cycloaddition product of a dialumene with toluene. The mechanism for the formation of product complex was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) methods.

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mapping the constellation of structural and dynamic changes concurrent with allosteric inhibitor binding to caspase&#8208;7, also known as allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs), reveals the nexus between the active site and the remote allosteric pocket. These ASARs also elucidate the link between structure and catalytic power for caspase&#8208;7. Our insights from exploration of caspase&#8208;7 allostery offer a new path for navigating allosteric drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Spies and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300872).

         <dc:description>Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH. Here we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Among the general interest in fluorinated compounds, trifluoromethoxylated molecules play a specific role. However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trilfuoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge. Here, 2,4dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) is used as a trifluoromethoxylating reagent to perform nucleophilic substitution under mild metal&#8208;free conditions with different leaving groups, including direct dehydroxytrifluoromethoxylation. A mechanistic study rationalized the reaction and subsequently proposed only three reaction conditions, depending on the reactivity of the starting substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and the DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic frameworks. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline/4&#8208;quinolone tautomerization has been harnessed to achieve directed, regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones. Introduced as the 4&#8208;quinolone, the O&#8208;borylated quinoline is initially formed. Critically, the newly&#8208;formed 4&#8208;(pinBO)&#8208;quinolines then undergoes Ir&#8208;catalysed, N&#8208;directed, selective C&#8208;H functionalization/borylation at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the 4&#8208;quinolone tautomer. The C8&#8208;borylated quinolines were converted to their corresponding potassium trifluoroborate (BF3K) salts and to their C8&#8208;chlorinated quinolone derivatives. The two&#8208;step C&#8208;H functionalization/borylation&#8208;chlorination reaction sequence resulted in various C8&#8208;Cl quinolones in good yields.

         <title>Degradation of penicillinic antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymatic catalysis in a biomimetic Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat bacterial infections. However, their use has been somehow limited given the emergence of bacteria with resistance mechanisms, such as &#946;&#8208;lactamases, which inactivate them by degrading their four membered beta&#8208;lactam&#160;rings.&#160;So, a total knowledge of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamases is required. Here, we report a novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, 1), possessing functional channels capable to accommodate and interact with antibiotics, which catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the penicillinic antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone. In particular, MOF 1 degrades, very efficiently, the four membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic, and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. Combined single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies and density functional (DFT) calculations offer unique snapshots on the host guest&#8208;interactions established between amoxicillin and the functional channels of 1. This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn&#8208;bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C&#8208;N bond of the lactam ring.</dc:description>

This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn-bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C-N bond of the lactam ring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of carbon centered radical generation from alkyl alcohols mediated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene salts has been explored computationally for 7 different NHCs. The influence of the electronic properties for each mechanistic step is rationalized and has been proven to be key for reactivity.







Abstract
Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in&#8197;situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalyst to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remain underexplored. Herein, a DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrates that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterizes how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups can be attached to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) group to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. One of the photocages in this study, NPdiCl, is identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.







Abstract
Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages was designed that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups were conjugated with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. These azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH&#8197;5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, it was shown that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH&#8197;5.0 and neutral pH&#8197;7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, NPdiCl was identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work compares six antiaromatic naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers through computational methods (NICS&#8208;XY scans) and experimental techniques (NMR, UV&#8208;vis, CV, and SC&#8208;XRD).







Abstract
Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional material (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8, which has a step&#8208;like dielectric phase transition at 383&#8197;K/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and excellent photoelectric properties, was obtained by using rigid benzylammonium cations as templates.







Abstract
Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS). However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature. The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99&#8197;K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34&#8197;eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current (2.12&#215;10&#8722;13&#8197;A), a high on/off ratio (1.77&#215;103), and a fast response (&#964;rise=125&#8197;&#956;s and &#964;decay=419&#8197;&#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Acyltransferase LovD9 for the Biosynthesis of Statin Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils the substrate promiscuity of acyltransferase LovD9, which turns to be very efficient by accepting vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl derivatives as acyl donors for the obtaining of statin analogues.







Abstract
This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9&#8208;catalyzed acylation. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl and Alkenyl Halides from Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relevance of aryl fluorosulfonates in coupling reactions has increased over the past decade. Surprisingly, the use and synthesis of alkenyl fluorosulfonates is still poorly described. In this paper, the advantageous use of aryl and alkenyl fluorosulfonates instead of the corresponding triflates is reported to synthesize aryl and alkenyl halides using halide salts and commercially available ruthenium catalysts.







Abstract
Aryl and alkenyl halides are widely used as key intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly for the formation of organometallic reagents or as radical precursors. They are also found in pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. In this work, the synthesis of aryl and alkenyl halides from the corresponding fluorosulfonates using commercially available ruthenium catalysts is reported. Notably, this is the first conversion of phenols to aryl halides that is efficient with chloride, bromide, and iodide. Fluorosulfonates are readily prepared using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and less expensive substitutes for triflates. Although aryl fluorosulfonates and their reactions are well known, this is the first report of an efficient coupling of alkenyl fluorosulfonates. To finish, it was demonstrated, by means of representative examples, that the reaction is possible in a one&#8208;pot process, starting directly from phenol or aldehyde.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Organocatalytic Umpolung of Bromocations: An Accelerated Stereoselective Dibromination Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, organocatalytically achieved polarity reversal of cationic bromine, is presented. The proven bromocation source N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) was converted to a superior bromoanion reagent by H/Br exchange with a secondary amine, substantiated with spectroscopic and computational evidences. The concept has further been used in a successful accelerated organocatalyzed dibromination of olefins in a non&#8208;hazardous, commercially viable process with a wide range of substrate scope. The reactivity of key entities observed through NMR kinetics and reaction acceleration using only 10 mol% of catalyst, account for its major success. The nucleophilicity of the bromoanion was found to be superior in comparison to other nucleophiles such as MeOH, H2O and the protocol dominates over competing allylic bromination reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissymmetric Triaryltriazines: Small Mass Columnar Glasses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Columnar liquid crystals with very small molecular masses that form anisotropic glasses well above room temperature are obtained by mixed dissymmetric substitution of sym&#8208;triazine with ester&#8208;bearing phenyl and phenanthryl or tetrahelicenyl moieties. The combination of low molecular symmetry with configurational flexibility and short polar ester moieties stabilizes the mesophase over large temperature ranges and induces pronounced calorimetric glass transitions within the anisotropic fluid despite the smallness of the molecules. In contrast to more symmetrical homologs, no ester tails longer than ethyl are necessary to induce the liquid crystalline state, allowing for the near&#8208;absence of any insulating and weight&#8208;increasing alkyl periphery. Films drop&#8208;cast from solution show in all cases emission spectra that do not show significant change of fluorescence emission upon annealing, indicating that the columnar hexagonal mesoscopic order is obtained directly upon deposition from solution and is resistant to crystallization upon annealing.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Magnetic Relaxations of Cyano&#8208;Bridged {DyIIIMoV} Systems by Tuning the N&#8208;Sites in &#946;&#8208;diketone Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8722;4f molecular nanomagnets have re&#8208;called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they bring more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} systems, four&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketone ligands bearing different substitution N&#8208;sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL1), 1,3&#8208;Bis(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL2), 1&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL3) and 1,3&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL4). By reacting with DyCl3&#183;6H2O and K4Mo(CN)8&#183;2H2O,&#160;four cyano&#8208;bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL1)2(H2O)3]}&#183;6H2O (1), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL2)(H2O)3(CH3OH)]}2&#183;2CH3OH&#183;3H2O (2), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8]3(HL3)(H2O)2(CH3OH)]&#183;H2O}n&#160;(3) and {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL4)2(H2O)3]}&#183;2H2O&#183;CH3OH (4) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that&#160;1&#160;and&#160;4&#160;are binuclear complexes,&#160;2&#160;has a tetragonal structure, and&#160;3&#160;exhibits a stair&#8208;like polymer chain structure. The DyIII&#160;ions in all complexes have eight&#8208;coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO7N1&#160;for&#160;1&#160;and&#160;4, DyO6N2&#160;for&#160;2, and DyO5N3&#160;for&#160;3. Magnetic measurements indicated that&#160;1&#160;is a zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes&#160;2&#8722;4&#160;are field&#8208;induced SMMs, with complex&#160;4&#160;featuring a two&#8208;step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations revealed that changing the N&#8208;sites in the&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8722;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the DyIII&#160;centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;precise Dicationic Tetraboranes: Syntheses, Structures and Rearrangement to a Alkylidene Borate&#8208;Borenium Zwitterion and a 1,3&#8208;Azaborinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes, featuring an electron&#8208;precise tetraboron chain, were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases give rise to different outcomes according to the conditions employed, including: 1) reduction and rearrangement of the tetraborane chain to give a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium species; 2) cleavage of the tetraborane chain to afford a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine; and 3) reduction of the supporting ligands to provide a diamino dipotassium salt. The zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium can be viewed as an analogue of the base&#8208;stabilized diborenes. NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a highly polarized B&#8208;B bond in the zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium, in which the formal oxidation states can be considered as &#8722;1 and +2. These results suggest the considerable potential of tetraboranes as synthons for novel low&#8208;valent boron species.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties of Aza&#8208;BODIPYs in the Near&#8208;InfraRed Region by Introducing Electron&#8208;Donating Thiophene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituting by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was observed and analyzed for the first time in detail in this work. Although the hexagonal packing aggregation of CD&#8208;based polyrotaxane is a well known phenomena, corresponding studies in terms of rotaxanes without any polymer structure have not been conducted so far, probably owing to the difficulty of the molecular design. Meanwhile, we synthesized a series of [3]rotaxane species via a urea&#8208;end&#8208;capping method and evaluated their aggregation behavior by XRD and SEM measurements. As a result, [3]rotaxane species containing native CD rings showed clear signals assigned to the hexagonal packing by XRD measurement as well as polyrotaxane, proved their aggregation capability. Since the corresponding per&#8208;acetylated derivatives did not show this aggregation behavior, the driving force of this aggregation was suggested to be hydrogen bond formation among CD units. The effect of axle end structures and partial acetylation of CDs were also studied.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Fast Circularly Polarized Luminescence in 2&#8208;Coordinate Chiral Mechanochromic Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of chiral mechanochromic copper(I) cAAC (cAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes with a variety of amide ligands have been studied with regard to their photophysical and chiroptical properties to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships for the design of efficient triplet exciton emitters exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from 1/3LLCT states or phosphorescence from 3LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries glum. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &#955;max = 601&#8208;715 nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non&#8208;aggregated CPL&#8208;active copper(I) complex with glum of &#8208;3.4&#183;10&#8208;3 combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#183;105 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic Properties of Known and New &#8208;COOH Functionalized M(IV) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two new &#8208;COOH functionalized MOFs of composition [M6O4(OH)6(PMA)2(H2PMA)] &#183; x H2O, M = Zr, Hf), denoted CAU&#8208;61, synthesized using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA), a tetracarboxylic acid, as the linker and acetic acid as the solvent. The structure was determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data and one dimensional inorganic building units are connected through tetracarboxylate as well as dicarboxylate linker molecules, resulting in highly stable microporous framework structures with limiting and maximum pore diameter of ~3.6 and ~5.0 &#197;, respectively, lined with &#8208;COOH groups. Thermal stabilities of up to 400 &#176;C in air, chemical stability in water at pH 1 to 12 and water uptake of 17 mol/mol prompted us to study the proton exchange of the &#181;2&#8208;OH, &#181;3&#8208;OH of the IBU and &#8208;COOH groups of the linker by titration with LiOH.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report two new -COOH functionalized MOFs of composition [M6O4(OH)6(PMA)2(H2PMA)] &#183; x H2O, M = Zr, Hf), denoted CAU-61, synthesized using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA), a tetracarboxylic acid, as the linker and acetic acid as the solvent. The structure was determined from powder X-ray diffraction data and one dimensional inorganic building units are connected through tetracarboxylate as well as dicarboxylate linker molecules, resulting in highly stable microporous framework structures with limiting and maximum pore diameter of ~3.6 and ~5.0 &#197;, respectively, lined with -COOH groups. Thermal stabilities of up to 400 &#176;C in air, chemical stability in water at pH 1 to 12 and water uptake of 17 mol/mol prompted us to study the proton exchange of the &#181;2-OH, &#181;3-OH of the IBU and -COOH groups of the linker by titration with LiOH. Comparison of the pKa values with three UiO-66 derivatives confirms distinct pKa value ranges and trends for the different acidic protons. Furthermore, the preparation of Zr-CAU-61 membranes and first results on permeation of dyes and ions in aqueous solutions are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Formation in an Ionic Liquid Wetting Layer: A Combined STM, IRAS, DFT and MD Study of [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to improve the selectivity of noble metal catalysts. To understand the origins of this selectivity control, we performed model studies by surface science methods in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We investigated the growth and thermal stability of ultrathin IL films by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). We combined these experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to obtain information on the orientation of the ions, the interactions with the surface, the intermolecular interactions, and the structure formation. Additionally, we performed density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to interpret the experimental data.
We studied the IL 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111) surfaces. We observe a weakly bound multilayer of [C2C1Im][OTf], which is stable up to 390 K, while the monolayer desorbs at ~450 K. [C2C1Im][OTf] preferentially adsorbs at the step edges and elbows of the herringbone reconstruction of Au(111). The anion adsorbs via the SO3 group with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface. At low coverage, the [C2C1Im][OTf] crystallizes in a glass&#8208;like 2D phase with short&#8208;range order. At higher coverage, we observe a phase transition to a 6&#8208;membered ring structure with long&#8208;range order.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the role of guanidinium salts in interface engineering for boosted performance of inverted perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large&#8208;scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge&#8208;extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr&#8208;treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600 hours at 16&#8208;25 &#176;C and 35% &#8208; 50% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Silylated Dihydroquinazolinone as Photocatalytic Energy Transfer Enabled Radical Hydrosilylation Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrosilylation of alkenes is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. In addition to the platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation, silyl radical addition reactions are notable as economic reactions. We have developed an efficient and widely applicable silyl radical addition reaction by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives under photocatalytic conditions. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and styrene derivatives underwent hydrosilylation to give addition products in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photocatalyst functioned not as a photoredox catalyst but as an energy transfer catalyst. DFT calculations clarified that the triplet excited state of 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives released a silyl radical through the homolytic cleavage of a carbon&#8211;silicon bond, and this was followed by the hydrogen atom transfer pathway, not the redox pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Inept N2 Activation of Tri&#8208;Nuclear Nickel Complex with Labile Sulfur Ligands Facilitates Selective N2H4 Formation in Electrocatalytic Conversion of N2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of N2 to the energy vector N2H4 under benign conditions is highly desirable. However, such N2 fixation processes are extremely rare. It has been recently reported that N2 to N2H4&#160; conversion can be achieved electrochemically by using a trinuclear [Ni3(S2C3H6)4]2&#8208; complex (named as [Ni3S8]2&#8208;). There are hardly any precedents of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) by molecular catalysts having Ni and the highly unusual selectivity for N2H4 over NH3 makes this electrochemical reduction unique. A systematic theoretical study employing calibrated Density Functional Techniques to unearth the mechanisms of NRR (4e&#8208;/4H+) and HER (2e&#8208;/2H+) was conducted for the aforementioned trinuclear Ni complex. Our findings unravel a curious case of ligand lability working in tandem with metal centers in facilitating this unprecedented electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is shown that the poor N&#8208;N bond activation property of Ni is responsible for this unusual selectivity. Additionally, the HER mechanistic pathways have also been delineated in this report. The mechanistic intricacies thus unearthed in this study may assist in developing more efficient electrocatalysts for N2H4 production through NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Luminous Efficiency of AgInS2&#160;Quantum Dots and Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;70&#160;Composite for White Light Emitting Diodes Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in the field of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is still an important challenge due to their low luminous efficiency&#160;and quenching phenomenon. In this paper, we prepared AgInS2&#160;QDs/zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;70 (AIS/ZIF&#8208;70) composite by microwave hydrothermal method. Owing to the high porosity and stability of ZIF&#8208;70, it could effectively prevent quenching issues due to the aggregation of QDs. Since the ZIF&#8208;70 and QDs were chemically bonded, the formation of ZnS layer could effectively passivate the surface defect and thus the quantum yield reached 21.49%&#160;in&#160;aqueous solution. The luminous efficiency (LE) of the assembled AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED&#160;was reinforced by 6.8 times with molar&#160;ratio of AgIn/Zn=18, i.e. at 5.26% molar fraction of ZIF&#8208;70. Moreover, the color rendering index&#160;(CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED were 84.3 and 3631 K, respectively, indicating its potential application in solid&#8208;state lighting.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;diimine copper complex&#8208;catalyzed trifluoroethylation and pentafluoropropylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in alkyl esters, halides, and protected amines by employing CF3CHN2 and CF3CF2CHN2 reagents. Reactions proceed in dichloromethane solvent at room temperature. Identical C&#8208;H functionalization conditions and stoichiometries are employed for generality and convenience. Selectivities for C&#8211;H insertions are higher for compounds possessing stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. Preliminary mechanistic studies point to a mechanism involving a pre&#8208;equilibrium forming a &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;diimine copper&#8208;CF3CHN2 complex followed by rate&#8208;determining loss of nitrogen affording the reactive copper carbene. It reacts with trifluoromethyldiazomethane about 6.5 times faster than with 1&#8208;fluoroadamantane explaining the need for slow addition of the diazo compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Strategies for Profiling Potential Cellular Targets of Anandamide and Cannabidiol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human endocannabinoid system regulates a myriad of physiological processes through a complex lipid signaling network involving cannabinoids and their respective receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R). Anandamide (AEA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are classical examples of cannabinoids that elicit a variety of effects, both beneficial and detrimental, through these receptors. Mounting evidence suggested the presence of other potential cannabinoid targets that may be responsible for other observable effects. However, prior pharmacological studies on these cannabinoid compounds provided scant evidence of direct engagement to these proposed targets. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no chemoproteomics studies nor any protein profiling studies have been demonstrated on CBD. Here we showed that, by taking advantage of the recently developed &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) approach, we have identified several new putative targets of both AEA and CBD. Comparison of these interaction landscapes with those obtained from the well&#8208;established affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) platforms led to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation studies of selected proteins led us to conclude that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with the AfBPP approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Performance of CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cell by Modified Zinc Oxide Nanorods Array with [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 Butyric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PBCA) is introduced to modify ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs) electron transport layer to reduce surface defects, ameliorate the morphology of perovskite film, enhance charge extraction properties, and improve the photovoltaic performance of CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells. The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05&#8201;%.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;Bridged Bisbutatrienes as Models for Longer Cumulenes: Various Transformations for the Construction of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of longer cumulenes for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has received considerable interest. Recently conjugated bisbutatrienes have been evaluated as mimics of a longer cumulene. In this research, the hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes were synthesized. They underwent various cyclizations to construct fulvene, pentalene, germacycle, benzocyclobutene, and cyclooctatetraene frameworks.







Abstract
Cumulenes have attracted considerable attention due to their unique structural and electronic properties. Despite their high potential for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, the synthetic utility of longer cumulenes remains to be established owing to their inherently high reactivity. Conjugated bisbutatrienes having two cumulene moieties linked by a spacer as a mimic of a longer cumulene were evaluated. Here, the synthesis and characterization of hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes are described. These bisbutatrienes underwent various cyclizations, to construct the unique &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks inaccessible by other methodologies. The bisbutatrienes were converted into fulvenes, pentalene, germacycle, and benzocyclobutene under various conditions. Furthermore, a cyclooctatetraene derivative was synthesized by a one&#8208;step dimerization of the bisbutatriene.

         <title>Defluorination of Fluorophenols by a Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species: Observation of a New Intermediate Along the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study on a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species in reaction with halophenols gives efficient dehalogenation including defluorination in the product. Along the reaction mechanism a novel intermediate is characterized spectroscopically and assigned to be an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo adduct.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health as well as in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with halophenols through defluorination reactions and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We study the reactivity pattern of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species with a series of trihalophenols (X=F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with &#955;max at 558&#8197;nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.

Benefiting from the features like polymeric linear structures, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic adaptiveness, supramolecular polymers (SPs) are favored as exploiting muscle&#8208;like materials, allowing for imitating the muscle functions. However, a substantial part of these materials barely owned an unitary motion orientation while it was obviously known that muscle movements involved distinct orientations. Herein, M1 holding the structure of 44&#8208;membered macrocycle with two aldehyde groups was designed, meanwhile, M2 comprising of secondary ammonium ions, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups as well as the alkyl chains was fabricated, for which it could be assembled with M1 to generate SPs based on host&#8211;guest interactions from a large macrocycle and two secondary ammonium ions. SPs underwent vertical compression upon the addition of N2H4 owing to the forming dynamic covalent bonds, notably, mechanically interlocked structures were also generated. Afterwards, the vertically compressed SPs experienced horizontal shrinkage when tetrabutylammonium chloride was contributed due to the destruction of host&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>Mechanism of Acyl Group Migration in Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration has been the subject of several studies. Such migration processes may cause problems during synthesis, isolation, and purification of different acyl&#8208;bearing compounds, and have biological relevance, for example, in the metabolism of pharmaceuticals. Considering the recent evidence of acyl group migration being possible even over glycosidic bonds, it could be hypothesized to be involved also in the regulation of biological activity of natural polysaccharides in the host cells. Migrations are mostly observed in carbohydrates, typically having several hydroxyl groups near each other. Several studies have investigated the migration in a single or only a few different carbohydrate molecules, providing different suggestions for the mechanisms of migration, seldom supported by comprehensive computational investigations. In this concept article we discuss the recent progress on the mechanistic aspects of acyl group migration, with carbohydrates in particular focus.</dc:description>

The results showed high electron mobilities, up to 0.3 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1, in the case of NDI derivatives and moderate values of around 10&#8208;3 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1 for PDI&#8208;based semiconductors. Quantum chemical calculations were performed in order to support the experimental data. The results suggest that adequate molecular characteristics and larger crystalline domains in NDI vs. PDI semiconducting films may be the reasons behind the enhanced electrical properties of NDI derivatives. Furthermore, when the lateral donor substituents are triphenylamine groups, the mobilities were slightly higher in comparison to phenylcarbazole donor groups due to an improved electron&#8208;donating character. Other characterization techniques such as AFM, X&#8208;ray diffraction or spectroelectrochemistry, among others, have been performed to analyze supramolecular order, charge carriers&#8217; nature and stability, parameters closely related to charge transport characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Autofluorescent Artemisinin&#8208;Benzimidazole Hybrids via&#160;Organo&#8208;Click Reaction: Study of Antiviral Properties and Mode of Action in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug modification by a fluorescent label is a common tool for studying its mechanism of action with fluorescence microscopy techniques. However, the attachment of a fluorescent label can significantly alter the polarity, solubility, and biological activity of the investigated drug, and, as a result, the studied mechanism of action can be misrepresented. Therefore, developing efficient drugs, which are inherently fluorescent and can be tracked directly in the cell is highly favorable. Here we present an easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs by a combination of two readily available non&#8208;fluorescent pharmacophores via a non&#8208;cleavable linker using a&#160;Ramachary&#8208;Bressy&#8208;Wang&#160;organocatalyzed azide&#8208;carbonyl&#160;[3+2] cycloaddition (organo&#8208;click) reaction.&#160;All newly prepared fluorescent compounds showed strong anti&#8208;HCMV activity (EC50 down to 0.07&#177;0.00 &#181;M), thus presenting a very promising drug developmental basis compared to the approved drug ganciclovir (EC50 2.60&#177;0.50&#160;&#181;M). Remarkably, in vitro fluorescent imaging investigation of new compounds revealed induced changes in mitochondrial structures, which is a phenotypical hallmark of antiviral activity. This approach opens up new vistas for the easy formation of potent fluorescent drugs from readily available non&#8208;fluorescent parent compounds and might facilitate insight into their mode of action in living cells, avoiding the requirement of linkage to external fluorescent markers.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes: Dual Reagents for the Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nano&#8208;materials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling formation of strong and covalent C&#8208;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists in the reduction of a preformed NHC&#8208;Au(I) complex with a large excess of a reducing agent rendering the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report on the straightforward synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (NHC&#8208;AuNPs) by reacting a commercially&#8208;available gold(I) precursor with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize NHC&#8208;BH3&#160;reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC&#8208;BH2Cl as a byproduct. This strategy garners efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC&#8208;borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation in the range of 4.9 &#177; 0.9 nm to 10.0 &#177; 2.7 nm. Our strategy also allows the unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as&#8208;prepared NHC&#8208;AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without engaging extensive purification or size selectivity techniques and are stable over months.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligations are increasingly used for the synthesis of proteins. Excellent ligation rates, even at low concentrations, in combination with mild and selective deselenization conditions can overcome some of the most severe challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Here we present the versatile multicomponent synthesis and application of a new ligation auxiliary that combines a photocleavable scaffold with the advantages of selenium&#8208;based ligation strategies. We investigate its use with respect to different ligation junctions and describe a novel para&#8208;methoxybenzyl deprotection reaction for the selenol moiety. The glycine&#8208;based auxiliary enabled successful synthesis of the challenging target protein G&#8208;CSF.</dc:description>

Neutral organic heterocycles as electroauxiliaries such as 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters have become reliable tools for alkyl radical formation. Here we show that 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline&#8208;derived alkyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinolines act as competent radical precursors with the ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals.

Furthermore, the dihydroquinolines&#8217; reactivity towards a denitrative alkylation of nitroolefins such as &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene was discovered. Most importantly, the released biquinoline can be recycled, which greatly improves the overall atom&#8208;economy of these alkyl radical precursors in comparison to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.</dc:description>

Biological activity: 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salt derivatives have been extensively studied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts and ligands. Meanwhile, it has also shown a wide range of highly effective bioactivities, including the activities of antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti&#8208;plasmodium and even worm growth regulation. The development and applications of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts in the development of both agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals are attractive.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30&#8197;years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. Finally, our perspective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs is presented.

         <title>Photomodulation on Active Sites of Adsorbents: Controllable Adsorption Processes with Improved Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation on adsorptive sites is an emerging strategy to achieve selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Compared with traditional adsorption techniques, active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be flexibly regulated by light irradiation based on the demands of adsorption process. This concept summarizes recent advances in this field and highlights the exquisite strategies of photoregulation on active sites.







Abstract
Adsorption is a widely applied technique in producing high&#8208;purity chemicals with advantages of low energy consumption, high selectivity, and mild operating conditions. However, traditional adsorbents have inflexible properties and suffer from the trade&#8208;off between selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Recently, the emerging photoresponsive adsorbents have provided new avenues for adsorption techniques. Active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be regulated through steric hindrance or tunable adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions. Therefore, variation in adsorptive capacity is able to readily achieve through photomodulation, and the corresponding adsorption/desorption cycles are energy&#8208;saving. This concept mainly summarizes recent efforts on the fabrication and application of photoresponsive adsorbents with tunable active sites. Also, the future opportunities and critical challenges of photoregulation on adsorptive sites are presented.

         <title>Integrating Regioselective E&#8594;Z Isomerization of Trienones with Cascade Sequences under Photosensitizer&#8208;Free Direct Irradiation at 390&#8197;nm</title>

Isomerization&#8208;enabled cascade: Conjugated polyenes undergo photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation at 390&#8197;nm for the highly regioselective E&#8594;Z alkene isomerization and subsequent cascade sequences to stereoselectively provide bridged bicyclic products. The directionality results from the stabilizing n&#8594;&#960;* interactions.







Abstract
The regioselective E&#8594;Z isomerization of a target olefin unit embedded in a conjugated polyene is challenging. Examples are limited to retinal and its derivatives only. The problem is further amplified when such an isomerization is integrated into cascade sequences, among which the regioselectivity and subsequent directionality are the major bottlenecks. Indeed, there are no reports till date for such a transformation. Herein, it is reported that such a controlled isomerization and subsequent cyclization cascade can be enabled by photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation of linearly conjugated acyclic polyenes in dichloromethane solvent using a 390&#8197;nm LED. The directionality results from deconjugation of the extended &#960;&#8208;system in the transient Z&#8208;isomer due to stabilizing n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls (C=O&#8594;C=O) or 1,4&#8208;carbonyl/&#8208;aryl (C=O&#8594;aryl) groups. The involvement of such noncovalent interactions has been supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography and control experiments. Thus, conjugated trienones can be stereoselectively converted into oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner, including the first example by regioselective isomerization of a tetrasubstituted alkene. The reaction conditions are very general (&gt;46 examples). The reaction can be conducted under open air atmosphere at ambient temperature. Such a cascade cyclization can also be realized in solid state.

Detailed atomic structural information of biomacromolecules in their native solution statues over several magnitude length scales was revealed by extended q&#8208;range X&#8208;ray scattering data and pair distribution function analysis.







Abstract
We communicate a feasibility study for high&#8208;resolution structural characterization of biomacromolecules in aqueous solution from X&#8208;ray scattering experiments measured over a range of scattering vectors (q) that is approximately two orders of magnitude wider than used previously for such systems. Scattering data with such an extended q&#8208;range enables the recovery of the underlying real&#8208;space atomic pair distribution function, which facilitates structure determination. We demonstrate the potential of this method for biomacromolecules using several types of cyclodextrins (CD) as model systems. We successfully identified deviations of the tilting angles for the glycosidic units in CDs in aqueous solutions relative to their values in the crystalline forms of these molecules. Such level of structural detail is inaccessible from standard small angle scattering measurements. Our results call for further exploration of ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements for biomacromolecules.

         <title>Peracid Oxidation of Unactivated sp3 C&#8722;H Bonds: An Important Solvent Effect</title>

The solvent effect: The peracid oxidation of unactivated alkanes in fluorinated alcohol solvents leads to the corresponding alcohol in high yield and with excellent levels of selectivity.







Abstract
The peracid oxidation of hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents is a low yielding and poorly selective process. Through a combination of DFT calculations, spectroscopic studies, and kinetic measurement it is shown that the origin of this is electronic in nature and can be influenced through the addition of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). Performing the reaction of a cycloalkane with mCPBA in a fluorinated alcohol solvent such as nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol (NFTB) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which act as strong HBD and poor HBA, leads to significantly higher yields and selectivities being observed for the alcohol product. Application of the optimised reaction conditions allows for the selective oxidation of both cyclic and linear alkane substrates delivering the corresponding alcohol in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The transformation shows selectivity for tertiary centres over secondary centres and the oxidation of secondary centres is strongly influenced by stereoelectronic effects. Primary centres are not oxidised by this method. A simple computational model developed to understand this transformation provides a powerful tool to reliably predict the influence of substitution and functionality on reaction outcome.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent guanine microplatelets exposing the high refractive index (1&#8201;0&#8201;0) face are synthesized by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule in guanine crystals in the presence of P(VP&#8208;co&#8208;VA). The synthesized NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals show red and green fluorescence. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence.







Abstract
Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused on in the last years. However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in the laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescence and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70&#8201;%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives to Formamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a new pathway (the urea derivatives underwent catalytic pyrolysis at first, followed by fast hydrogenation of the isocyanates) that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives to formamides even at lower H2 pressures (&lt;5&#8197;bar). This enables a two&#8208;step process of high&#8208;value CO2 utilization under mild pressures, including CO2 to urea derivatives and ureas hydrogenation.







Abstract
The utilization of CO2 as a non&#8208;toxic and cheap feedstock for C1 is a desirable route to achieve high value&#8208;added chemicals. In this context, we report a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of CO2&#8208;derived ureas. Various alkyl and aryl urea derivatives were successfully hydrogenated to obtain the corresponding recyclable amines and formamides (up to 97&#8201;% yield), highlighting the good substrate applicability of this method, which makes this method a sustainable alternative for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides in the presence of amines. In the meantime, we have discovered a new pathway that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives even at lower H2 pressure (&lt;5&#8197;bar). This methodology might provide a new insight into the reduction functionalization of CO2 under mild pressure to form new C&#8722;N bond. Based on the control experiments and the observed intermediate products, we clarify the mechanism for selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of ureas.

         <title>Better Peptides via Chemical Glycosylation: Somatostatin Analogues Having a Human Complex&#8208;Type N&#8208;Glycan with Improved Drug Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A haloacetamidyl glycan with no protecting group on the hydroxy and carboxy groups can be readily used in combination with Cys&#8208;scanning performed across any peptide and protein sequences to produce glycosylated analogues having a native complex&#8208;type glycan. Chemical glycosylation represents a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.







Abstract
Somatostatin (somatotropin release&#8208;inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a growth hormone inhibitory factor in the form of a 14&#8208; or 28&#8208;amino acid peptide. SRIF affects several physiological functions through its action on five distinct SRIF receptor subtypes (sst1&#8211;5). Native SRIF has only limited clinical applications due to its rapid degradation in plasma. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed glycosylated SRIF analogues that possess not only metabolic stability but also high affinity to all five receptor subtypes by attaching human complex&#8208;type oligosaccharides. Such glycosylated SRIF analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles could be potent and novel therapeutic drugs for SRIF&#8208;related diseases in which several SRIF receptor subtypes are closely involved, and also shed light on new indications. Our results show that chemical glycosylation can be a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;Like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;Efficiency Bi&#8208;Functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 was successful prepared through a sulfuration process. MnS/Ni3S4 catalysts showed good oxygen evolution reactions (Ej=10=1.55&#8197;V) and oxygen reduction reactions (E1/2=0.81&#8197;V). When the catalyst was used in Zn&#8211;air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (308&#8197;h) and small voltage gap (0.83&#8197;V &amp; 0.86&#8197;V) at 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
In this paper, a waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this coating structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed good catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the overpotential of it is only 320&#8197;mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81&#8197;V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400&#8197;h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300&#8197;h.

When the catalyst was used in Zn&#8211;air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (308&#8197;h) and small voltage gap (0.83&#8197;V &amp; 0.86&#8197;V) at 5&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a waxberry-like MnS/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this coating structure, MnS is located inside and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is wrapped on the surface to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two-phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composites showed good catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the overpotential of it is only 320&#8197;mV, and the half-wave potential can reach 0.81&#8197;V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn-air batteries. When the current density is 3&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400&#8197;h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A BF2 Chelate Exhibiting Excimer&#8208;like Fluorescence with an Unusually Large Stokes Shift in the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer emission: Crystals of the target compound exhibit bright emission in the red region for which the spectral profile is broad and well separated from absorption transitions. The solid&#8208;state structure comprises tightly grouped molecular pairs that assemble into highly ordered columns while facilitating excimer formation at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The target mono&#8208;BF2 complex is weakly emissive in fluid solution because radiationless decay of the excited&#8208;singlet state is promoted through an intramolecular N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N hydrogen bond. The lack of mirror symmetry for this compound is attributed to vibronic effects, as reported previously for the bis&#8208;BF2 complex (BOPHY). Red&#8208;shifted fluorescence is observed from single crystals, the emission quantum yield approaching 30&#8201;% with a fluorescence lifetime of 2&#8197;ns. The large Stokes shift of 5,700&#8197;cm&#8722;1 helps minimize self&#8208;absorption. Crystallography indicates that the internal fold and twist angles are increased substantially in the crystal, but the hydrogen bond is weakened relative to solution. The crystal structure is compiled from pairs of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail molecules having a shift of ca. 4.1&#8197;&#197; and closest approach of ca. 3.5&#8197;&#197;. These molecular pairs are arranged in columns, which, in turn, assemble into sheets. The proximity favors excitonic coupling between individual molecules, with the coupling strength obtained by analysis of the absorption spectrum reaching ca. 1,000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Both the ideal dipole approximation and the extended dipole methodology seriously overestimate the coupling strength, but the atomic transition charge density procedure leads to good agreement with experiment. Emission is attributed to the closely coupled molecular pair functioning in an excimer&#8208;like manner with the exciton trapped in a local minimum. Increasing temperature causes a slight blue shift and loss of fluorescence.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxynitrogenation of Carboxylic Acids with Cyanamides to Access Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenation strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is reported. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent and features an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is highlighted by the broad substrate scope and application in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and scaleup reactions and derivatizations.







Abstract
Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is described. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes ((TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac) with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane were fully synthesized and characterized. (TPSPr)2IrAcac with bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can efficiently suppress the concentration quenching, achieved its highest current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration. Highly efficient green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are achieved by using (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants.







Abstract
Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 and 36.06&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#934;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Azide&#8211;Enolate Cycloaddition&#8208;Rearrangement Enables Direct &#945;&#8208;Amination of Amides and Enelactam Synthesis from Esters
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse frameworks via cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement: Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements were applied to the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcome of the reaction varied by substrate, depending on the fate of triazoline intermediates generated in the cycloaddition. These processes form part of a wider cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement reaction manifold providing concise access to diverse frameworks.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements offer potential for rapid access to diverse molecular frameworks from simple precursors. We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diverse frameworks via cycloaddition-rearrangement&lt;/b&gt;: Azide-enolate cycloaddition-rearrangements were applied to the direct &#945;-amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene-&#947;-lactams from esters. The outcome of the reaction varied by substrate, depending on the fate of triazoline intermediates generated in the cycloaddition. These processes form part of a wider cycloaddition-rearrangement reaction manifold providing concise access to diverse frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azide-enolate cycloaddition-rearrangements offer potential for rapid access to diverse molecular frameworks from simple precursors. We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;-amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene-&#947;-lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene-&#947;-lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;-amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;-amino amides or lactams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering, an electrochromic Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating a viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety achieved modulated interface electron transfer, thus providing a favorable paradigm for visual analysis such as phosphoprotein detection and aptamer&#8208;directed target recognition.







Abstract
As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;BODIPY Conjugates as Highly Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>

Shine bright: Graphene oxide chemically functionalized with BODIPY via a dynamic covalent bond evidences an equilibrium between GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY and free PBA&#8208;BODIPY. While for GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY an ultrafast energy transfer from BODIPY toward GO occurs, free BODIPY simply emits light.







Abstract
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of an uncommon cyclo[18]carbon precursor: The analyses of the electronic structure, bonding character, electron delocalization, and response to an external magnetic field indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than cyclo[18]carbon (C18), and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.







Abstract
Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions were examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). The aromaticity was investigated, studying the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Responsive Benzothiazolines as Potential Cleavable Fluorogenic Linkers for Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiazolines in aqueous solutions are cleaved under irradiation with &#947;&#8208;rays in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, leading to the formation of fluorescent products. The study paves the way for the future use of benzothiazolines as radiation sensors or as prodrugs in the context of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy. Herein we describe the use of benzothiazolines, which upon treatment with 137Cs produced &#947;&#8208;irradiation in water give rise to fluorescent benzothiazoles and concomitant release of amines or carboxylic acids. In a proof of concept study, we showed that benzothiazolines may be used as new cleavable linkers that can be triggered upon irradiation.

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Secondary Benzamide&#8208;based BODIPY Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>

The benzamide group adopts the trans geometry in the fluorescent target compounds, thereby reducing conformational heterogeneity and opening the way to develop sophisticated nanophotonic materials. The main translational motion with these secondary benzamides concerns inversion of the aryl ring, evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and quantified by quantum chemical calculation.







Abstract
Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8722;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8722;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes of PFC substituted terpyridines and MIC ligands are presented as molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The MIC ligand is used to tune the kinetics of CO2 electrocatalysis and the terpyridine ligands are used for controlling the overpotential.







Abstract
In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC=polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.

         <title>Metallic and Dimensional Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories of MOFs are optimized in controlling polysulfides and catalyzing conversion. S supported on 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs exhibits longer lifetime and superior rate capability, due to the highly exposed Ni nuclei. This work pioneered the avenue of sieving decent LSBs cathodes through optimizing the dimensions and metals of MOFs synergistically.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) made of metallic nodes and organic ligands can suppress polysulfide shuttling and promote redox kinetics. In this paper, the effects of crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories on chemical performance of LSBs have been meticulously explored electrochemical performance. As a result, exposed Ni active sites in a lamellar Ni&#8208;MOF was found to deliver a superior electrochemical performance. The as&#8208;assembled LSBs with 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs cathode deliver a much superior initial discharge capacity, (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), and exhibit excellent cycling stability over 550&#8197;cycles than those analogues of 3D stereoscopic Ni&#8208;MOF and 2D lamellar Co&#8208;MOF. This work proposed a perspective in elevating LSBs performance through synergistic optimization of the MOFs dimensions and the metallic nuclei in the cathodes.

Spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones were synthesized through Cs2CO3&#8208;promoted formal [2+3] and [4+3] cycloadditions of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates. Thirty&#8208;six examples of the target compounds were obtained in up to 89&#8201;% yield.

Abstract
A divergent reaction of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates for the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones was disclosed. This reaction sequence involved an initial formation of five&#8208;membered spirocyclic products followed by an intramolecular ring&#8208;opening and ring expansion to produce seven&#8208;membered diazepinones. We demonstrated that controlling the reaction time could modulate the reaction pathway for formation of different molecular frameworks for the same set of substrates. Based on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was also discussed and proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the process.

         <title>Trapping of a Transient Base&#8208;Stabilised Alumylene and Alumylene&#8208;Type Reactivity of a Self&#8208;Stabilising Dialumene towards Organic Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;stabilised aluminium(III) terphenyl dihalide was reduced in the presence of alkynes to trap the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed alumylene [NHC(Ter)Al:]. In the absence of an alkyne the reduction yielded a self&#8208;stabilised dialumene, which showed alumylene&#8208;like reactivity towards organic azides.







Abstract
The reduction of a carbene&#8208;coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl&#8208;substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI2), yielded a &#8220;masked&#8221; dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self&#8208;stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene&#8208;stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in&#8197;situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8722;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The reduction of a carbene-coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl-substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), yielded a &#8220;masked&#8221; dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self-stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene-stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in&#8197;situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8722;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Long Persistent Phosphorescence in Coumarin&#8208;Phosphine&#8208;Based Coinage Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the shining hour: Coumarin&#8208;functionalized aminodiphosphine and its copper and silver complexes of different nuclearities have been synthesized. The complexes exhibit unusual persistent phosphorescence with a lifetime as long as 1.5&#8197;s in solution at 77&#8197;K that is strongly dependent on phase and temperature.







Abstract
A coumarin functionalized aminodiphosphine has been introduced as a bidentate ligand in coinage metal chemistry. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trimetallic copper and silver complexes were synthesized with this ligand. The hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with rich luminescence properties. These include coumarin&#8208;based blue fluorescence, observed as a sole emission in solution at room temperature, and green phosphorescence, which is efficient at low temperatures and dominates the spectra of the metal complexes. In the rigid environment of frozen solutions, the green phosphorescence shows an unusually long (for metal complexes) decay on the seconds timescale in high quantum yield. In addition, a red phosphorescence, which may be assigned to the triplet state localized in the phosphine&#8208;M3Cl2 (M=Cu, Ag), is observed for the trinuclear complexes at low temperature. Neither the second&#8208;long phosphorescence nor the red emission is observed for the coumarin ligand, thus they must be a result of the coordination to coinage metal clusters. The excited states in these compounds were also investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germylenes with two ylide&#8208;substituents are usually highly nucleophilic species. Herein, we demonstrate that introduction of a cyano moiety into the ylide backbone decreases the LUMO energy and thus significantly enhances the electrophilic nature of these species. This is reflected in the reactivity but also in the molecular structure of the diylidylgermylene.







Abstract
Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN=Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylide YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8211; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8211; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through &#960; bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8722;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the design and application of multi&#8208;step enzymatic cascades to synthesize enantioenriched epoxides and vicinal aromatic triols from simple biomass&#8208;derived starting materials in one pot. These artificial metabolic pathways involve a tailor&#8208;made aldolase, a highly evolved cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme, and when needed a specifically chosen epoxide hydrolase. These attractive biocatalytic cascades can be performed under environmentally benign conditions, such as the use of aqueous media and mild temperatures, and do not require the isolation of reaction intermediates. Good to excellent conversions, high enantioselectivity, and moderate to good product yields are achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68&#8201;% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.

A carbonyl&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 2,3&#8208;epoxy amides and esters has been developed by use of a chiral nickel/bipyridine complex as the catalyst.







Abstract
Herein we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amides and esters with aromatic amines as nucleophiles. This method features high regiocontrol, diastereospecific SN2 reaction pathway, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions, furnishing a wide range of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives in a highly enantioselective manner. Notably, the selective nucleophilic attack to the C&#8208;4 position of epoxides is controlled by the directing effect of the pendant carbonyl group.

         <title>Pyridone&#8208;Doped Acenes with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes from anthracene to heptacene with improved stability have been synthesized. The pyridone unit demonstrates different nature in the doped acenes depending on the molecular length. The capacity of electron transport between the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked acene planes is preserved.







Abstract
Besides the peripheral modification, the introduction of heteroatoms to modulate the property of longer acenes with improved chemical stability has been extensively studied for their potential applications in organic electronics. However, the utilization of 4&#8208;pyridone, a common unit in the air&#8208; and photo&#8208;stable acridone and quinacridone, to decorate higher acenes with increased stability has not been realized yet. Here we present the synthesis of a series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes up to heptacene via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of aniline and dibromo&#8208;ketone. The effect of pyridone on the property of doped acenes were investigated experimentally and computationally. With the &#960;&#8208;extension of doped acenes, the pyridone ring shows the weakened conjugation and gradual loss of aromaticity. The doped acenes demonstrate enhanced stability in solution and maintain the electronic communication between the acene planes.

         <title>Insight into the Evolution Track for the Metathesis of Alkenes within Hierarchical Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution track within hierarchical zeolite: A new functionality of mesoporosity is disclosed as the intrazeolitic interface boundary with alumina phase, which enables the creation of evolution track for the active metathesis catalysts. The working track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, alumina slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites.







Abstract
The usage of hierarchical MFI zeolite enables a boost of the catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based catalysts for the olefin&#8208;metathesis reaction. The harvest of active catalysts roots in a segmental evolution track between hierarchical zeolite and Al2O3 slices for the fabrication of active sites. The working evolution track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, Al2O3 slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The infilling of disaggregated Al2O3 slices into the intracrystalline mesopores triggers the creation of localized intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interfaces, which enables the subsequent migration and trapping of surface molybdates into the micropores. The insulation of intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interface or shielding of zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites leads to the break of the evolution track. Our findings disclose the hidden functionality of mesoporosity as intrazeolite interface boundary for the fabrication of active sites and supply a new strategy for the rational design of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Controlled Shell and Kernel Modifications of Atomically Precise Pd/Ag Superatomic Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first controlled modification of kernel and shell arrangements in Pd&#8208;doped superatomic silver clusters containing interstitial hydrides is presented. The sequential addition of individual Ag atoms to an icosahedron core results in PdH@Ag19, PdH@Ag20, and Pd@Ag21, while maintaining a 12&#8208;ligand stabilizing framework. Remarkable aqueous stability, proven by unsupported catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol was demonstrated.







Abstract
The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp=S2P(OiPr)2&#8722;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+ 2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55&#8201;% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+ 3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2 contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200&#8197;&#956;s (&#955;ex=448; &#955;em=842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive. The catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol is demonstrated with 1&#8211;3 at room temperature.

BASHY dyes, such as the one drawn in the foreground, are prepared in a multicomponent reaction. This is symbolized by the background, which shows part of a beach that is made of sea&#8208;washed stones and which is located in the North of Portugal (Praia de Belinho). The BASHY dyes discussed in the Research Article by P.&#8197;M.&#8197;P. Gois, U. Pischel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300579) show several photophysical features such as fluorescence, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which jointly orchestrate the function of the dye.

Carbon dots are widely applied for fluorescent&#8208;based sensors. The interplay between dynamic and static quenching is essential to design specific sensors.







Abstract
The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect inside the Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite several small molecules being encapsulated inside cage&#8208;opened fullerene derivatives, such species have not considerably affected the structures and properties of the outer carbon cages. Herein, we achieved an effective inner&#8208;space modification for an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative by insertion of a neutral CH3CN molecule into the cavity. The thus obtained CH3CN@open&#8208;C60 was found to show an enhanced polarity, affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without preparative HPLC that was needed for the previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. It was revealed that both presence of the encapsulated CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the CH3CN play an essential role for the change in the electronic properties, studied by NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD3CN with internal C60 surface was discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hantzsch ester as efficient and economical NAD(P)H mimic for in vitro bioredox reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in bioredox reactions&#8208;related fields. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench&#8208;stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations including two non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenases and two flavin&#8208;dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H&#8208;relying bioredox reactions.</dc:description>

The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench-stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations including two non-heme diiron N-oxygenases and two flavin-dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H-relying bioredox reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered. This effect controls regioselectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine, which leads to products with the most effective conjugation. As a result, the product of this quadruple exchange demonstrates no tendency of the coordination of the NMe groups to neighboring lithium atoms despite the absence of steric restrictions.

Subsequent isolation of FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S in cryogenic matrices (Ar, Ne, and N2) allows its characterization with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy by combination with 15N&#8208;isotope labeling and computations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/VTZ&#8208;F12 level of theory. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 550 nm, this cyclic compound undergoes ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN, followed by dissociation to FP and SN2 under subsequent UV&#8208;irradiation at 365 nm.

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;Gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzidine&#8208;type wide&#8208;gap materials are designed in order to access green processing techniques, via functionalization with solubilizing pendant groups. Flexible thin films and organic electronic devices are then prepared from low&#8208;toxic solvent such as alcohols or o&#8208;xylenes.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208; and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material's solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150&#8197;mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33&#8197;cm&#215;2&#8197;cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4&#8197;V) presented by organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For preparation of particle size libraries of products with low solubility constants, a new reaction&#8208;diffusion method is presented through the example of a catalytically valuable Prussian Blue analogue. The particle size analyses of the Liesegang Patterns forming via &#8216;dormant&#8217; citrate complex show the method produces libraries of differently sized products in each band. The new method can be expanded into other PBAs and 2D diffusion systems.







Abstract
Liesegang patterns that develop as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. Finally, the applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.

         <title>Boosting Methanol&#8208;Mediated CO2 Hydrogenation into Aromatics by Synergistically Tailoring Oxygen Vacancy and Acid Site Properties of Multifunctional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst composed of Cr2O3 and H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 guarantees the superior aromatics synthesis performance of CO2 hydrogenation in a single&#8208;pass. The structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components is well established to boost aromatics synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1&#8201;% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8&#8201;% under high reaction temperature (350&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4&#8201;% and 80.1&#8201;% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Thienyl&#8208;Substituted Diboranes(4): Electronic Stabilization of Radicals Versus Increased Reactivity towards Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thienyl substituents at a diborane(4) provide a mixture of steric flexibility, &#963;&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing and mesomeric effects, which enable the stabilization of a highly delocalized diboron radical anion, as well as an increased reactivity towards bond activation and rearrangement reactions upon Lewis&#8208;base coordination and two&#8208;electron reduction.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low oxidation state main group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides a platform for both radical anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8722;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8722;B bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight both the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8211;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic molecular containers (MOMCs), constructed with flexible backbones, exhibit a unique feature both in the structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the functional groups in the skeletons. This Review focuses on the recent development of flexible MOMCs from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications, which remains a fertile ground for opportunity and creativity.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8211;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8211;organic system construction.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental/theoretical investigations link the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, which are key in organic electronics. the first cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units was synthesized and studied. Comparison of the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties with those of a shorter analogue highlights the key role played by the hoop size. Corresponding cycloparaphenylenes with eight and ten phenyl units were also compared. Notably the saturated field effect mobility of the five&#8208;unit cyclocarbazole is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue.







Abstract
In the field of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a strong impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and study of the first example of a cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. In particular, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22&#215;10&#8722;5 vs 1.04&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). However, the study of the other organic field&#8208;effect transistor characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules in thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct incorporation of 18F into target molecules of interest in aqueous media has many practical advantages. This paper classifies the atoms that form covalent bonds with fluorine and reviews the existing methods for 18F&#8208;labeling in aqueous media. Additionally, some 18F&#8208;labeling mechanisms are explained.







Abstract
18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. The preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers involves critical steps such as the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, work&#8208;up, and 18F&#8208;product purification, which are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this Review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. The Review is focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8722; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.

         <title>Impact of Faradaic Interlayer Confinement and Carbon&#8208;Centered Macrostructure Designs for Ion Capture and the Recovery of Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of desalination and renewable energy, several capacitive deionization processes and variables responsible for ion capture and the recovery of elements are reviewed.







Abstract
Environmental protection associated with renewable energy is among the most critical challenges for translational ion&#8208;capture based on capacitive storage of ions in electrical double layers at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Electric double&#8208;layer capacitance with charge induction and faradaic pseudo&#8208;capacitance with charge transfer classifies the capacitance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer varying degrees of electrolyte confinement. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting water desalination, such as the effect of nanopores for ion capture, the ion sieving effect, the effect of hydration energy, and hydration radius in the carbon sub&#8208;nanometer pore. Moreover, the surface phenomena of electrodes, including carbon corrosion, and the potential of zero charge to control the oxidation of carbon electrodes are explained along with protection mechanisms. The various capacitive deionization (CDI) operations and the corresponding electrochemical cell technologies are briefly introduced, including the significance of double&#8208;layer charging materials with faradaic intercalation, which suffer less from co&#8208;ion expulsion. Finally, we revisit the effects of various nanoarchitectures and the construction of capacitive deionization electrodes for clean water technology.

         <title>Interaction Modes Between SF4 and Ketones; Study of Intermediates in Deoxofluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetone and SF4 form two thermally unstable adducts. In the presence of HF and SF4, 2&#8208;adamantanone forms an adduct with a unique O&#8212;(HF)&#8212;S interaction motif that elucidates possible interactions during deoxofluorination of ketones. Based on NPA charges, the C=O&#8212;HF and F3SF&#8212;HF interactions are deemed competitive.







Abstract
Interactions between ketones and SF4 are studied for the simplest ketone, acetone, and the bulky polycyclic 2&#8208;adamantanone. Acetone forms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[O=C(CH3)2]2, as well as the dimeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts [SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C(CH3)2]2 as identified by low&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and, for the latter, X&#8208;ray crystallography. In both adducts, SF4 acts as a double chalcogen&#8208;bond donor to two keto groups. In contrast 2&#8208;adamantanone does not form an isolable solid adduct with SF4; in the presence of HF, however, it forms SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, which comprises chains with weak S&#8212;O and S&#8212;FH chalcogen bonds in the crystal structure. Sulfur tetrafluoride in this compound is readily lost at &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the isolation of C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF at low temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aid in vibrational assignments and serve to describe the interactions of the keto group with SF4 and HF, as well as interactions between SF4 with HF. It is found that separate and combined CO&#8212;HF and CO&#8212;SF4 chalcogen bonds do not polarize the C=O group to any significant degree.

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proximity of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Pd plays an important role not only in the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladium species in intramolecular Hiyama coupling, but also in the activation of the silyl group to facilitate intramolecular substituent transfer. Various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes were synthesized by using this reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300988).

         <title>Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry with Collision&#8208;Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting the presence of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) in solution is difficult, so this study used tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation to probe bridging ions surrounding the uranyl ion and to determine fragmentation fingerprints of UPCs. The image shows an abstract artistic representation of the nanocluster U24Pp12, [(UO2)24(O2)24(P2O7)12]48&#8211;, and its movement through a quadrupole mass analyzer with subsequent fragmentation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a quadruple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/cobalt/photoredox/Br&#248;nsted base catalysis to realize branch&#8208;selective hydroacylation of styrenes with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. This protocol allows access to branched ketones from readily available materials in an atom&#8208;economical manner. The quadruple catalysis can transfer a formyl hydrogen of aldehydes as a hydrogen radical equivalent onto the terminal carbon of an alkene by controlled electron and proton transfers.</dc:description>

         <title>Amide Skeletal Elongation via Amino Acid Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide derivatization is useful to access valuable organic compounds considering the ready availability of molecules containing amide functionality. Current approaches to derivatize amide mainly focus on the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and amines. Incorporating both parts of the initial amide into the new derivatives is rare. Herein, we describe a simple and practical amide derivatization through amino acid insertion to prepare more complex amides. This insertion is applicable to all amino acids and more importantly, the chiral information is completely conserved during the insertion. Comparison of this insertion strategy with conventional amide synthesis demonstrates the synthetic advantages of this new protocol.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable self&#8208;adhesive films are promising coating materials for constructing smart windows. Compared to commonly used hydrogels, self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films have a variety of advantages and serve as a universal carrier of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, supramolecular adhesive is processed into self&#8208;adhesive films, which display tough and long&#8208;stable adhesion to commercially available organic/inorganic glass windows. Spiropyrans are used as the photo&#8208;responsive units to endow smart windows with switchable optical behavior. Reverse photochromism is successfully realized by the combination of supramolecular films and spiropyrans. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sunny, rainy, and cloudy.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>

The structural and electronic extension of the boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) dye platform yields stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorophores with applications in fluorescence lifetime imaging of live cells.







Abstract
A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes has been synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In an extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590&#8197;nm). In contrast, under physiological pH conditions in water, the PeT process is inherently decativated, thereby enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680&#8197;nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects on the Stability of Heavy Tetrel Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>London dispersion (LD) interactions, which stem from long&#8208;range electron correlations arising from instantaneously induced dipoles can occur between neighboring atoms or molecules, for example, between H atoms within ligand C&#8211;H groups. These interactions are currently of interest as a new method of stabilizing long bonds and species with unusual oxidation states. They can also limit reactivity by installing LD enhanced groups into organic frameworks or ligand substituents. Here, we address the most recent advances in the design of LD enhanced ligands, the sterically counterintuitive structures that can be generated and the consequences that these interactions can have on the structures and reactivity of sterically crowded heavy group 14 species.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Design Rules for Photoinduced Electron Transfer Quenching in Triangulenium Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rates of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (A) and DAOTA (D) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline&#8208;like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rates of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (1), a long (2), and a long twisted (3), 4&#8208;aminophenyl, 4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure PET rate constant&#160;kPET&#160;ranging from &gt;4x1011&#160;s&#8208;1&#160;to 2x109&#160;s&#8208;1. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in&#160;3, a 20&#8208;fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with the decrease in&#160;kPET&#160;the quenching in&#160;3A/D&#160;is still highly efficient, with nearly 99% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relative slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. We performed Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics and Molecular Dynamics study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B.&#160;The results reveal that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A/B catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4 and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved.&#160;KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A.&#160;The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long&#8208;range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage, Stereoretentive, and Site&#8208;Selective Modification of Synthetic Peptides by Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalysed reaction of activated thioethers unveils alanyl radical intermediates in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner. Installation of the activating group is simple, and the intermediate radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage peptide functionalisation and expands the scope of analogues that can be accessed.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage functionalisation is an attractive method to generate peptide analogues containing non&#8208;natural residues. It is shown that cysteine residues can be activated as Crich&#8208;type thioethers, either by alkylation of a synthetic cysteine&#8208;continuing peptide or by incorporation of a modified cysteine unit into solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis. Photoredox catalysed reaction of the thioether generates an alanyl radical intermediate in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner, even in the presence of free cysteine residues. The radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. A method to avoid unwanted alkylation of amine residues was identified and the process was applied to the functionalization of both linear and cyclic synthetic peptides.

         <title>[Ni(CO)4]+ as NiI Synthon: Synthesis and Characterization of NiI Half&#8208;Sandwich and Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 19&#8201;valence electron, half&#8208;sandwich cations [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, C6H4F2) and the homoleptic [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ were synthesized endergonically from [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) by irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium. This procedure is likely transferable to any kind of weak ligand. The [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ cation revealed an unprecedented &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;slipped sandwich structure which probably is the ultimate NiI source.







Abstract
The stable, easily accessible salt [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) was used as a NiI synthon to generate the novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, o&#8208;dfb=1,2&#8208;F2C6H4). By irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium, even the rather endergonic reaction to a [Ni(o&#8208;dfb)2]+ salt was successful (&#916;rG&#176;(solv)=+78&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The latter displays an unprecedented slipped &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;sandwich structure and is the ultimate synthon to NiI&#8208;chemistry.

Multi&#8208;substituted quinoline derivatives were synthesized from dicyanoalkenes and unsaturated aldehydes via an organocatalyst&#8208;mediated domino reaction in excellent yields. Two catalytic system were established including diphenylprolinol silyl ether and di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine. As catalyst is the amine and a by&#8208;product is only water, this is an environmentally benign reaction.







Abstract
Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ynals in one pot. We established two methods: one is catalyzed by chiral diphenylprolinol silyl ether, and the other is catalyzed by di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine, in combination with p&#8208;nitrophenol. A wide variety of dicyanoalkenes can be employed. As the catalysts are secondary amines, and water is the only by&#8208;product, this is an environmentally benign synthetic method for the preparation of substituted quinolines.

         <title>High Rates of Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions are Dictated by Entropic Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second&#8208;order rate constants for the SPOCQ click reaction between an ortho&#8208;quinone and various strained systems are accurately determined. Thermodynamic activation parameters of the click reaction with two strained alkynes were determined using Eyring plots, and show that the reaction is controlled by entropic factors.







Abstract
Reaction rates of strained cycloalkynes and cycloalkenes with 1,2&#8208;quinone were quantified by stopped flow UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis. We found that the strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 (k2 1824&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) reacts &gt;150&#8197;times faster than the strained alkene TCO&#8208;OH 5 (k2 11.56&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and that derivatization with a carbamate can lead to a reduction of the rate constant with almost half. Also, the 8&#8208;membered strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 reacts 16&#8197;times faster than the more strained 7&#8208;membered THS 2 (k2 110.6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone 1 with THS 2 is associated with &#916;H&#8800; of 0.80&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;46.8 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=14.8&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3 is associated with, &#916;H&#8800;=2.25&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;36.3 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=13.1&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped&#8208;flow measurements, with calculated &#916;G&#8800; of 15.6&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS 2, and with &#916;G&#8800; of 14.7&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid click reactions.

         <title>De&#8208;Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RNA&#8208;focused library targeted against the production of the oncogenic microRNA&#8208;21 was designed and synthesized according to a five&#8208;step sustainable approach. Low&#8208;micromolar affinities towards pre&#8208;miR&#8208;2, good selectivity against other nucleic acid structures and promising inhibition activity (in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range) in Dicer processing of the pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 were determined for a trifluoromethyl&#8208;functionalized derivative.







Abstract
Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands by using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on targeting the biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the well&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions between the small&#8208;molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.

         <title>HAV&#8208;Peptides Attached to Colloidal Probes Faithfully Detect E&#8208;Cadherins Displayed on Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a minimum of chemistry, we developed a tool based on functionalized colloidal probes that mimic the presence of adjacent cells detecting the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on the cell surface. The specificity and dynamic strength of the peptide&#8208;E&#8208;cadherin interaction can be read out demonstrating the potential for a label&#8208;free screening of cell surfaces.







Abstract
Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological processes, including wound healing, barrier formation and tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelial cells. To identify this molecule on the surface of cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical amino acid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized and attached to solid&#8208;supported membranes covering colloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies were established, one based on the complexation of DOGS&#8208;NTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide using in&#8197;situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attach to the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield by lipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on living cells either using video particle tracking or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examined confirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods were also used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essential for the development of novel biosynthetic materials given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medical applications.

         <title>Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis base catalytic transformation to functionalized 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolines is developed via [3+2] triazene&#8208;alkene cycloaddition reactions of an array of unactivated alkenes with CF3CHN2. This approach features good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic utility of the procedure is elucidated by structure diversification of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples).

     alt="Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient Lewis base catalytic transformation to functionalized 3- and 5-trifluoromethylpyrazolines is developed via [3+2] triazene-alkene cycloaddition reactions of an array of unactivated alkenes with CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This approach features good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic utility of the procedure is elucidated by structure diversification of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks Hybrid Materials for Luminescence Responsive Chemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess several unique features of structural and functional chemistry, together with other modular optical performance, which make them candidates for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials still keep the parent COFs&#8217; virtues and also embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with cooperative emission with energy transfer and discrete one without energy transfer. In this review, the summary is highlighted on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and the relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. It is subdivided into five sections involving the three main topics. Firstly, the basic knowledges of COFs materials related to the luminescence responsive chemical sensing are introduced (including three sections), involving the chemistry, application and post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of COFs, the luminescence and luminescence responsive chemical sensing, and the luminescence responsive chemical sensing of non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids materials. Secondly, the systematic progresses are outlined on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials in luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given. It needs to refer that the pure COFs and non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids are not the main topic for this review and only simply mentioned for the general knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected coexisting solid solutions in the quasi&#8208;binary&#160;Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 phase diagram</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction between orthorhombic AgF2 and monoclinic CuF2 (y = 0.15, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) in a fluorine atmosphere resulted in coexisting solid solutions of Cu&#8208;poor orthorhombic and Cu&#8208;rich monoclinic phases with stoichiometry Ag1&#8208;xCuxF2. Based on X&#8208;ray powder diffraction analyses, the mutual solubility in the orthorhombic phase (AgF2:Cu) appears to be at an upper limit of Cu concentration of 30 mol % (Ag0.7Cu0.3F2), while the monoclinic phase (CuF2:Ag) can form a nearly stoichiometric Cu: Ag = 1: 1 solid solution (Cu0.56Ag0.44F2), preserving the CuF2 crystal structure. Experimental data and DFT calculations showed that AgF2:Cu and CuF2:Ag solid solutions deviate from the classical Vegard&#8217;s law. Magnetic measurements of Ag1&#8208;xCuxF2 showed that the N&#233;el temperature (TN) decreases with increasing Cu content in both phases. Likewise, theoretical DFT+U calculations for Ag1&#8208;xCuxF2 showed that the progressive substitution of Ag by Cu decreases the magnetic interaction strength |J2D| in both structures. Electrical conductivity measurements of Ag0.85Cu0.15F2 showed a ca. 2&#8208;fold increase in specific ionic conductivity (3.71&#183;10&#8208;13 &#177; 2.6&#183;10&#8208;15 S/cm) as compared to pure AgF2 (1.85&#183;10&#8208;13 &#177; 1.2&#183;10&#8208;15 S/cm), indicating the formation of a vacancy&#8208; or F adatom&#8208;free metal difluoride sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Aminochlorination of Alkenes Without the Use of an External Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The niche field of Photochemistry offers opportunities that are not found in &#8220;traditional&#8221; ground state chemical pathways. Aminochlorinated derivatives is an interesting family of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalised compounds that provide access to a variety of natural products and pharmaceutical active substances. A practical, catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination protocol is described herein, providing access to intermediates of great importance, utilising mild and photochemical reaction conditions (370 nm), where N&#8208;chlorosulfonamides are used as both nitrogen and chlorine sources. A wide variety of olefins, decorated with a plethora of functional groups, were tested providing excellent results (28 examples, 18&#8208;88% yield). Mechanistic studies (UV&#8208;Vis, control experiments and quantum yield measurement) were also performed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the Amino Acid Molecular Characteristics on the Formation of Fluorescent Gold&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Based Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Role of amino acids like L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe), L&#8208;glutamine (Gln) and L&#8208;arginine (Arg) is described and interpreted in terms of their potential for preparation of fluorescent molecular&#8208;like gold and silver nanostructures. We are among the first to demonstrate the effect of syntheses conditions as well as the molecular characteristics of Phe, Gln and Arg amino acids on the structure of the formed products. Comprehensive optical characterizations (lifetime, quantum yield (QY%)) of the blue&#8208;emitting products were also carried out. It was confirmed that for all Au&#8208;containing samples and for Gln&#8208;Ag system the characteristic fluorescence originates from few&#8208;atomic metallic nanoclusters (NCs) where the reduction of metal ions was promoted by citrate in some cases. Relatively high QY% (~ 18%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;stabilized Au NCs due to the existence of an electrostatic interaction between the electron rich, positively charged guanidium side chain of Arg and the negatively charged carboxylate group of citrate on the metallic surface. Size and structural analysis of the products were evaluated by infrared measurements and dynamic light scattering techniques.</dc:description>

By using a convergent synthetic approach, the shown series of partially reduced and/or demethylated analogs were obtained. Depending on the site of modification, these compounds show a range of microtubule&#8208;binding affinities and cellular activities, thus providing new insights into the relative importance of specific double bonds and methyl groups for biological activity. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;H. Altmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300703).

         <title>Antitumor Activity and Reductive Stress by Platinum(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes based on Guanosine
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes bearing NHCs based on guanosine undergo a substantial increase in antiproliferative activity when changing the ligand trans to the NHC from bromide to hydride. Compound 6 leads to an increase in reductive stress and increase in glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Platinum(II) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes based guanosine and caffeine have been synthesized by unassisted C&#8722;H oxidative addition, leading to the corresponding trans&#8208;hydride complexes. Platinum guanosine derivatives bearing triflate as counterion or bromide instead of hydride as co&#8208;ligand were also synthesized to facilitate correlation between structure and activity. The hydride compounds show high antiproliferative activity against all cell lines (TC&#8208;71, MV&#8208;4&#8208;11, U&#8208;937 and A&#8208;172). Methyl Guanosine complex 3, bearing a hydride ligand, is up to 30&#8197;times more active than compound 4, with a bromide in the same position. Changing the counterion has no significant effect in antiproliferative activity. Increasing bulkiness at N7, with an isopropyl group (compound 6), allows to maintain the antiproliferative activity while decreasing toxicity for non&#8208;cancer cells. Compound 6 leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum and autophagy markers on TC71 and MV&#8208;4&#8208;11 cancer cells, induces reductive stress and increases glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cell line HEK&#8208;293.

         <title>Trinuclear PdII Complexes with a C3&#8208;Symmetric Triethynylbenzene&#8208;Based Tris&#8208;NHC Ligand: Catalytic Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic benefits: Trinuclear PdII complexes with an extended C3&#8208;symmetric triethynylbenzene&#8208;based tris&#8208;NHC ligand are presented. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex. An electronic effect in the trinuclear ligand platform is likely to be responsible for the better catalytic activity of the trinuclear complexes over mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
A new C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;imidazolium tribromide salt 3, featuring 1,3,5&#8208;substituted triethynylbenzene, was used for the preparation of a trinuclear PdII pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation&#8208;type (PEPPSI) complex by triple C2 deprotonation followed by the addition of PdCl2. Trinuclear PdII complex possessing a combination of NHC and PPh3 ligands has also been synthesized. The corresponding mononuclear palladium(II) complexes have also been synthesized for the comparison purpose. All these complexes have been characterized by using NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the trinuclear palladium(II) complex bearing mixed carbene and pyridine donor ligands has been established by using single crystal XRD. All the palladium(II) complexes have been used as pre&#8208;catalysts, which gave good to excellent yields in intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole and Sonogashira coupling reaction. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex for both catalytic transformations. The better performance of the trinuclear complex has also been further supported by preliminary electrochemical measurements. A negative mercury poison test was observed for both the aforementioned catalyses and therefore, it is likely that these organic transformations proceed homogeneously.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cycling</title>

Functional framework: A phosphate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework improves charge transport and enhances sulfur utilization as sulfur cathode additive for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their outstanding theoretical energy density. However, they suffer from low sulfur utilization and poor cyclability, greatly limiting their practical implementation. Herein, we adopted a phosphate&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) as a sulfur host. With their porous structure, remarkable electrochemical stability, and synthetic versatility, Zr&#8208;MOFs present great potential in preventing soluble polysulfides from leaching. Phosphate groups were introduced to the framework post&#8208;synthetically since they have shown a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and an ability to facilitate Li ion transport. The successful incorporation of phosphate in MOF&#8208;808 was demonstrated by a series of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis. When employed in batteries, phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;MOF (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4) exhibits significantly enhanced sulfur utilization and ion diffusion compared to the parent framework, leading to higher capacity and rate capability. The improved capacity retention and inhibited self&#8208;discharge rate also demonstrate effective polysulfide encapsulation utilizing MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4. Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high&#8208;density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.

         <dc:description>
Pt(II)&#8722;NHC complexes are used in alkene hydrosilylation reactions. Some of the examined compounds display excellent catalytic activity, outperforming Pt(0)&#8722;NHC pre&#8208;catalysts. Our study explores the catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationship and provides new mechanistic insights into this industrially important transformation. A sustainable protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal, allows us to access a series of organosilanes in very good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report the catalytic activity of a series of platinum(II) pre&#8208;catalysts, bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, in the alkene hydrosilylation reaction. Their structural and electronic properties are fully investigated using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Next, our study presents a structure&#8208;activity relationship within this group of pre&#8208;catalysts and gives mechanistic insights into the catalyst activation step. An exceptional catalytic performance of one of the complexes is observed, reaching a turnover number (TON) of 970 000 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 40 417&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Finally, an attractive solvent&#8208;free and open&#8208;to&#8208;air alkene hydrosilylation protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal (reduction of residual Pt from 582&#8197;ppm to 5.8&#8197;ppm), is disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;Pt(II)&#8722;NHC complexes are used in alkene hydrosilylation reactions. Some of the examined compounds display excellent catalytic activity, outperforming Pt(0)&#8722;NHC pre-catalysts. Our study explores the catalyst structure-activity relationship and provides new mechanistic insights into this industrially important transformation. A sustainable protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal, allows us to access a series of organosilanes in very good to excellent yields.

         <title>Etheno&#8208;bridged Azaacene Spiro Dimers</title>

Merging the world of cis&#8208;stilbenes and azaacenes: The synthesis of spiro&#8208;linked azaacene dimers conjugated via a secondary etheno&#8208;bridge is reported &#8211; introducing a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene core fragment. Conjugation decreases the optical gap of the presented dimers and broadens absorption, albeit opens a new decomposition pathway.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of two sets of spiro&#8208;connected azaacene dimers. Their geometry and electronic coupling are critically determined by a secondary linker, i.&#8201;e., an etheno&#8208; and an ethano&#8208;bridge. The core fragment of the etheno&#8208;bridged dimer corresponds to a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene. Optoelectronic properties, single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and stability with respect to oxidation of the conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated dimers are reported and compared. The conjugated dimers exhibit smaller optical gaps and bathochromically shifted absorption maxima, but are prone to unexpected oxygen addition, dearomatizing one of the azaacene substituents.

         <title>Y&#8208;Shaped D&#8208;A Type Thioxanthone Derivatives: Mechano&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and High&#8208;Contrast Mechano&#8208;Responsive Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A type molecules possessed two independent ICT states inside, resulted from the two independent D&#8722;A conjugation from their small donor arms to the acceptor. As their two D&#8722;A torsion angles are very sensitive to aggregated states, they showed interesting mechano&#8208;induced TADF and high&#8208;contrast MRL properties.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast mechano&#8208;responsive luminescence (MRL) materials with mechano&#8208;induced emission enhancement properties are fascinating candidates but few, for applications in rewritable media and recording devices. Here, an interesting design strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type molecules for high&#8208;contrast MRL materials was presented, based on substituted diphenylamine donor and planar acceptor. Interestingly, their D&#8722;A torsion angles are small in crystals but increased after ground, resulted in planar and twist intramolecular charge transfer (PICT and TICT) states, respectively. Therefore, high&#8208;contrast MRL switching between weak blue (450&#8197;nm) fluorescence and bright yellow (552&#8197;nm) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can be achieved for compound TXDO (4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxydiphenylamine donor), which photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 2.8&#8201;% to 54.7&#8201;% after ground. Most importantly, the two independent D&#8722;A conjugation dihedral angles are actually independent in the &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; molecules. Especially for compound TXDT (4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylamine donor), its crystal exhibited both PICT and TICT processes inside, resulted from the different dihedral angles of 11.8&#176; and 35.5&#176;, respectively. The TXDT crystal thus showed dual&#8208;peak emission, including both TICT fluorescence and PICT room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Therefore, this strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; D&#8722;A type molecules provide a new approach to design advanced luminescent materials with mechano&#8208;induced TADF feature, for high&#8208;contrast MRL and single&#8208;component white luminescence.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of anion supramolecular chemistry has received more and more attention in recent years. Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. This review is devoted to anion effects on the molecular, supramolecular structures and magnetic properties of discrete SCO compounds. Firstly, typical anions used in the synthesis of these compounds are briefly summarized according to their various geometries. This is followed by a collection of representative examples of anion&#8208;based SCO compounds, whose SCO properties are analyzed in terms of supramolecular interactions, geometry and charge of anions. In the third part, anion effects on SCO complexes of different kinds of metal centers and ligands are outlined and finally remarks on the synthesis new type of ionic SCO complexes in the future are described.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report&#160;the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure evidence of the potassium salt of the hexalacunary [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; (abbreviated as {P2W12})&#160;anion&#160;after its discovery by Contant and Ciabrini in 1977. In addition, we observed&#160;oligomerization of P2W12 into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer and a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer. The three phosphotungstate anions were synthesized through recrystallization of (NH4)12[&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48] from slightly alkaline (HOCH2)3CNH2/KCl, CH3NH3Cl/KCl, and CH3NH3Cl/NH4Cl solutions. The structure of {P2W12} is derived from [&#945;&#8208;P2W18O62]6&#8722; that has six tungsten&#8212;one from each polar group and four from the belt&#8212;removed, and the center of the lacunary site is capped by a potassium cation. Structures of {P4W25} and {P6W39} are constructed by connecting two and three {P2W12} units with {WO(OH2)}4+, respectively. The isolation of the a pure {P6W39} phosphotungstate framework&#160;without coordination with transition metal cations is unprecedented. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the bulk purity of these compounds, indicating that selective crystallization was achieved through the selection of counter cations and pH.</dc:description>

         <title>The Bulk Breast Cancer Cell and Breast Cancer Stem Cell Activity of Bi&#8208;nuclear Copper(II)&#8208;Phenanthroline Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes have been widely investigated as anticancer agents whereas multi&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes are underexplored. Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of two new bi&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes 1 and 2 comprising of 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline or 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, terminal chloride ligands, and bridging chloride or hydroxide ligands. The bi&#8208;nuclear copper(II) complex containing 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline 1 displays nanomolar toxicity towards bulk breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) grown in monolayers, &gt;50&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin (an anticancer metallodrug) and salinomycin (a gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;CSC agent). Spectacularly, 1 exhibits &gt;100&#8208;fold greater potency toward three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres than cisplatin and salinomycin. Mechanistic studies show that 1 evokes breast CSC apoptosis by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and damaging genomic DNA (possibly via an oxidative mechanism). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to probe the anti&#8208;breast CSC properties of bi&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture and Stabilization of the Hydroxyl Radical in a Uranyl Peroxide Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new uranyl peroxide cluster (UPC), U60Ox30*, which captures and stabilizes oxygen&#8208;based free radicals for more than one week. These radical species were first detected with a nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric assay and U60Ox30* was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as infrared (IR), Raman, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Identification of the free radicals present in U60Ox30* was done via room temperature solid and solution state X&#8208;band EPR studies using spin trapping methods. The spin trapping agent 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrroline N&#8208;oxide (DMPO) was definitive for identifying the free radicals in U60Ox30*, which are hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) that are stable for up to ten days that also persist upon addition of the metalloenzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Addition of the spin trapping agent &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl N&#8208;oxide)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnitrone (POBN) further confirmed the radicals were oxygen based, and deuteration experiments showed that the origin of the free radicals was from the decomposition of H2O2 in water. These results demonstrate that highly oxidizing species such as the &#8226;OH radical can be stabilized in UPCs, which alters our understanding of the role of free radicals present in spent nuclear fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative NHC Catalysis: An Unconventional Tool for Macrocyclic Oligoesters Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition to the polycondensation of dialdehydes and diols is herein presented as an alternative, atomeconomical synthetic route to macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). The disclosed protocol paves the way to the straightforward access to MCOs, starting from commercial dialdehydes, avoiding the use of toxic diacyl chlorides, commonly employed in traditional MCOs synthetic processes. The method is totally metal&#8208;free, takes place in the green Me&#8208;THF solvent and requires the use of a fully recyclable quinone oxidant. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers such as 2,5diformylfuran (DFF), 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), and isomannide, synthesizing a series of novel and known synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis, with product yields (51&#8208;86%) comparable to those obtained by traditional synthetic routes. Finally, to emphasize the synthetic relevance of the target macrocycles, an entropicallydriven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) key study has been performed, optimizing the organocatalyzed synthesis of poly(2,5furan&#8208;dimethylene 2,5 furandicarboxylate) (PBHMF) with numberaverage molecular weight up to 8200 g mol&#8208;1 and 66% isolated yield.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent modification of the metallic phase of MoS2 with a Hamilton&#8208;type ligand, transforming MoS2 to a recognition platform able to embrace barbiturate moieties via hydrogen bonding, is presented. The successful hydrogen bonding formation is easily monitored via simple electrochemical assessments, when a ferrocene&#8208;labeled barbiturate analogue is utilized as a proof of concept. Full spectroscopic, thermal and electron microscopy imaging characterization is provided for the newly formed recognition system, along with valuable insights concerning the electrochemical sensing. The methodology given expands beyond the sensing applications, confidently entering the territory of supramolecular interactions on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. The well&#8208;designed host&#8208;guest chemistry, presented herein, constitutes a guide and an inspiration to hosting customized&#8208;structured functional building blocks on MoS2 and its relatives via hydrogen bonding, opening new avenues on its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a major threat to global health, even as newly introduced antibiotics continue to lose their therapeutic value. Against this background, deeper insights into bacterial interaction with antibiotic drugs are urgently required, whereat fluorescently labeled drug conjugates can serve as highly valuable tools. Herein, we describe the preparation and biological evaluation of 13 novel fluorescent antibiotic&#8211;Cy5 dye conjugates, whereat the tuning of the polarity of the Cy5 dye proved to be a key element to achieve highly favorable properties for various fields of application</dc:description>
