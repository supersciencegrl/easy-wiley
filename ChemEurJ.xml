         <title>Linear bis&#8208;Coordinate Silver(I) and Iodine(I) Complexes with R3R2R1N&#160;Tertiary Amines</title>

         <dc:description>Homoleptic [L&#8211;I&#8211;L]&#8314; iodine(I) complexes (where L is a R3R2R1N tertiary amine) were synthesized via the [L&#8211;Ag&#8211;L]&#8314; &#8594; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[L&#8211;I&#8211;L]&#8314; cation exchange reaction. In solution, the amines form [R3R2R1N&#8208;Ag&#8208;NR1R2R3]&#8314; silver(I) complexes, which crystallize out from solution as the meso&#8208;[L&#8211;Ag&#8211;L]+complexes, as characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The subsequent [L&#8211;I&#8211;L]&#8314; iodine(I) analogues were extremely reactive and could not be isolated in the solid state. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the Ag&#8314;&#8211;N and I&#8314;&#8211;N interaction energies in silver(I) and iodine(I) complexes, with the former ranging from &#8208;80 to &#8208;100 kJmol&#8208;1 and latter from &#8208;260 to &#8208;279 kJmol&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures revealed Ag+&#183;&#183;&#183;C&#960; and Ag+&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C short contacts between the silver(I) cation and flexible N&#8208;alkyl/N&#8208;aryl groups, which are the first of their kind in such precursor complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Yet Another Case of Lithium Metal Atoms and Germanium Atoms Sharing Chemistry in the Solid State: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Ba2LiGe3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several Ba&#8211;Li&#8211;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba2LiGe3. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge6]10&#8211; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel&#8208;like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe3]4&#8211; honeycomb&#8208;like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba2+ cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re&#8208;evaluate the phase as Ba2Li1&#8211;xGe3+x (x &lt; 0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba2Li1&#8211;xGe3+x structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8211;Ge and Ge&#8211;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8211;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the c&#8208;cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB&#8208;LMTO&#8208;ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8211;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8211;Ge and Li&#8211;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Strain in Twisted Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of strained aromatics provide an additional insight into the relationship between structure and properties. In the last years, several approaches to twist pyrene&#8208;fused azaacenes have been developed that allow to introduce twists of different sizes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a new set of twisted dibenzotetraazahexacenes consituted by fused pyrene and quinoxaline residues that have been distorted by introducing increasingly larger substituents on the quinoxaline residues. Their twisted structure has been demonstrated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, absorption, fluorescence, electrochemical and theoretical studies shine light on the effects of the substituents and twists on the optoelectronic and redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Inert Iron Oxide Basal Planes through Heterostructure Formation and Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron oxides have emerged as a very promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production. However, the inert basal plane of iron oxides needs to be activated to enhance their catalytic efficiency. In this study, we employed heterostructure engineering and doped nickel to cooperatively activate the basal planes of iron oxide (Ni&#8208;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs) to achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ni&#8208;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent basic HER activity and stability, such as an extremely low overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density and corresponding Tafel slope of 58.6 mV dec&#8208;1. The increase in electrocatalyst activity and acceleration of hydrogen precipitation kinetics arises from the dual modulation of Ni doping and heterostructure, which not only modulates the electrocatalyst's electronic structure, but also increases the number and exposure of active sites. Remarkably, the generation of heterogeneous structure makes the catalyst stable. The Ni&#8208;doped catalyst has not only increased HER activity but also low&#8208;temperature resistance. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of inert iron oxide basal planes through heterostructure formation and doping is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, this technique can be extended to other non&#8208;noble metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article on luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes is presented in terms of molecular design strategies, structure&#8208;property correlations and their applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The future directions and opportunities for advancing the development of CMA complexes and the related OLEDs are proposed as well.







Abstract
Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes, such as, iridium(III) and platinum(II), as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal&#8208;bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d&#8208;orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA&#8208;based OLEDs have been made. Here, a Concept article on CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.

&lt;p&gt;This concept article on luminescent carbene-metal-amide (CMA) complexes is presented in terms of molecular design strategies, structure-property correlations and their applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The future directions and opportunities for advancing the development of CMA complexes and the related OLEDs are proposed as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes, such as, iridium(III) and platinum(II), as luminescent materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene-metal-amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal-bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand-to-ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d-orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA-based OLEDs have been made. Here, a Concept article on CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively charged 2H&#8208;MoS2: The surface of 2H&#8208;MoS2 was activated by reacting liquid exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 with NaBH4 yielding a novel anionically charged semi&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional 2H&#8208;MoS2 defined as n&#8208;2H&#8208;MoS2. The negative doping allowed for dispersibility in water and other polar solvents (unlike pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2), caused a red&#8208;shift in the material's photoluminescence, and allowed for facile functionalisation.







Abstract
The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950;=&#8722;25&#8197;mV and a 20&#8197;nm (0.05&#8197;eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material's spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards sequence/size defined macrocycles: Here we demonstrate a non&#8208;nucleic acid templated synthesis of peptide macrocycle complexes. By using hydrazone bonds, we template and organize short peptide oligomers along a solid supported peptide strand and cyclize them using microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis to form sequence and size defined macrocycles. The products are then released from the solid support via acidic hydrolysis and detected by LC&#8211;MS.







Abstract
The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.

         <title>Activation of the GaI Cation for Bond Activation: from Oxidative Additions into C&#8722;Cl and H&#8722;P Bonds to Reversible Insertion into P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung of the GaI cation: A GaI pincer complex allows significantly different reactivity compared to other known cationic GaI complexes. First controlled oxidative additions of the GaI cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P, and P&#8722;P bonds are presented, as well as cycloaddition reactions to 1,3&#8208;dienes. Intriguingly, the insertion into the P4 cluster was discovered to be reversible.







Abstract
Although the discovery of the GaI complex salt [Ga(PhF)2&#8208;3][Al(ORF)4] (RF=C(CF3)3, PhF=C6H5F) invoked the preparation of a diverse library of cationic Ga(I) coordination complexes and clusters, studies on small molecule activation with low&#8208;valent GaI cations are scarce. Herein, a first experimental study on the reactivity of a monomeric Ga(I) cation activated with a pyridine&#8211;diimine pincer ligand (in [Ga(PDIdipp)][Al(ORF)4]) towards small&#8208;molecules is reported. First controlled oxidative additions of the GaI cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds are presented. Moreover, the [4+1]cycloaddition to butadienes was achieved. Intriguingly, the isolated, blue insertion product into the P&#8722;P bond of P4 allows for the quantitative release of the P4 molecule upon reaction with AlEt3 and butadienes. Reversible P4 insertion of main&#8208;group metals has previously been reported for Ge and Sn, respectively. The experimental study is supported by high&#8208;level computational analysis of the in&#8208;part reversible oxidative additions at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c/def2&#8208;mSVP level of theory with COSMO&#8208;RS solvation in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Free, Self&#8208;Repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;free polyurethane type ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) was prepared in a facile manner. The mechanical robust, transparent ICE with self&#8208;healing ability proved its advantages in strain and temperature sensing. The recycling and remolding process did not deteriorate the sensing properties







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid&#8208;free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE&#8208;2) was synthesized and studied. The PU type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE&#8208;2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE&#8208;2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &gt;89&#8201;%, 400~800&#8197;nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06&#8197;MPa, elongation at break of 1760&#8201;%, and fracture energy of 14.98&#8197;kJ/m2), appreciable self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency &gt;90&#8201;%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE&#8208;2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro&#8208;expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human-machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile Route to Acyl (MIDA)Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the reactivity of the novel acetyl (MiDA)boronate radical allows access to a broad range of acyl (MIDA)boronates, which in suitable cases can be converted into B(MIDA) substituted furans and pyrroles.







Abstract
A modular approach to highly functional acyl (MIDA)boronates is described. It involves the generation of the hitherto unknown radical derived from acetyl (MIDA)boronate and its capture by various alkenes, including electronically unbiased, unactivated alkenes. In contrast to the anion of acetyl (MIDA)boronate, which has not so far been employed in synthesis, the corresponding radical is well behaved and readily produced from the novel &#945;&#8208;xanthyl acetyl (MIDA)boronate. This shelf&#8208;stable, easily prepared solid is a convenient acyl (MIDA)boronate transfer agent that provides a direct entry to numerous otherwise inaccessible structures, including latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives that can be transformed into B(MIDA) substituted pyrroles and furans. A competition experiment indicated the acyl (MIDA)boronate substituted radical to be more stable than the all&#8208;carbon acetonyl radical but somewhat less reactive in additions to alkenes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin (2) was stereoselectively synthesized from aldehyde 1, which was in turn obtained from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol and (&#8722;)&#8208;menthone. An attempted functionalization at position C5 remained futile, although several C&#8722;H activation methods could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide (3).







Abstract
The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2&#8201;% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic twofold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low yielding (10&#8201;%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.

The hydrogen&#8208;bond synthon between COOH and CONH2 drives the co&#8208;crystallization between N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine and benzamide. In water, the two molecules self&#8208;assemble to form a hydrogel with well&#8208;defined fibers having the same structure observed in the crystal state.

         <title>One Ligand to Bind them All: S~C~S2&#8722; Carbon&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;Based Gem&#8208;Dianion as Structuring Ligand for Iron Polymetallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;(diphenylthiophosphinoyl)methanediide dianion (SCS)2&#8722; is an ideal platform for the building of polymetallic iron assemblies in which the same carbon and sulfur environment is maintained upon redox states changes and nuclearity increase. Such a variety of structures with a same C&#8208;based ligand is unique in the frame or nitrogenase cofactor models.







Abstract
Numerous synthetic models of the FeMo&#8208;co cluster of nitrogenases have been proposed to find the simplest structure with relevant reactivity. Indeed, such structures are able to perform multi&#8208;electrons reduction processes, such as the conversion of N2 to ammonia, and of CO2 into methane and alkenes. The most challenging parameter to imitate is indeed the central carbide ligand, which is believed to maintain the integrity of iron sulfide assembly during the course of catalytic cycles. The study proposes the use of bis(diphenylthiophosphinoyl)methanediide (SCS)2&#8722; as an ideal platform for the synthesis of bi&#8208; and tetra&#8208;metallic iron complexes, in which the iron&#8208;carbon interaction is maintained upon structural diversification and redox state changes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals and make a radical chain operative.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8 mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8208;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1 mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface modification functionalized carbon dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) smaller than 10 nm constitute a new type of fluorescent carbon&#8208;based nanomaterial. They have attracted much attention owing to their unique structures and excellent photoelectric properties. Primitive CDs usually comprise carbon and oxygen and are synthesized in one step from various natural products or synthetic organic compounds, usually via microwave or hydrothermal methods. However, the uniformity of surface functional groups often make CDs lack the diversity of active sites required for specific applications. Therefore, the functionalization of CDs by specific groups is a powerful strategy for improving their photophysical and photochemical properties. This paper reviews surface modification strategies to overcome these shortcomings. Functionalizing CDs using covalent or non&#8208;covalent modification can give them unique properties and broaden their applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorene quantum dots can now be made at remarkably low cost in a simple two step process. Ball milling cheap abundant red phosphorus creates quantu dots trapped in bulk, which can then be freed by etching the surrounding amorphous phosphorus with lithium electride solution.







Abstract
Black phosphorene quantum dots (BPQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to produce high quality BPQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25&#8197;nm BPQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality BPQDs for academic and industrial applications.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Synthons in Organometallic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden synthons in organometallic synthesis. In this review, key gold&#8208;NHC complexes employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed in detail (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Besides their synthesis, the uses of these synthons as mechanistic probes are presented, as are their applications as efficient (pre&#8208;)catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photoemissive materials.







Abstract
The prominent role of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes in numerous research areas such as homogeneous (photo)catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science has prompted organometallic chemists to design gold&#8208;based synthons that permit access to target complexes through simple synthetic steps under mild conditions. In this review, the main gold&#8208;NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed. Mechanistic aspects involved in their synthesis and reactivity as well as applications of gold&#8208;NHC synthons as efficient pre&#8208;catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photo&#8208;emissive materials are presented.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Zinc Cooperative Catalysis for Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Hydrocarboxylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes was developed with gold&#8208;zinc bimetallic catalysts activating alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids via cooperative action of the gold and zinc sites. N&#8208;Substituents of the NHC ligand for gold complexes significantly affected their catalytic activities, in which a gold complex with a 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl substituent served as the most effective catalyst for the seven&#8208;membered ring formation.







Abstract
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of nonactivated internal alkynes with conformationally flexible linker chains was achieved with cooperative gold&#8208;zinc catalysts composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinylidene ligand including a bipyridine coordination site at the C5 position. A proximity effect of the gold and zinc sites was essential for their high catalytic activity, in which the internal alkyne activated by the cationic gold species was attacked by the carboxylic acid deprotonated by the basic zinc site. Using a gold(I)&#8208;complex with a bulky aromatic N&#8208;substituent, 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl group, for the NHC ligand facilitated seven&#8208;membered ring formation while minimizing intermolecular hydrocarboxylation as an undesired side reaction. The reaction mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculations.

&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;dig&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;hydrocarboxylation&lt;/b&gt; of internal alkynes was developed with gold-zinc bimetallic catalysts activating alkyne-tethered carboxylic acids via cooperative action of the gold and zinc sites. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Substituents of the NHC ligand for gold complexes significantly affected their catalytic activities, in which a gold complex with a 2,6-dibenzhydryl-4-methylphenyl substituent served as the most effective catalyst for the seven-membered ring formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; hydrocarboxylation of nonactivated internal alkynes with conformationally flexible linker chains was achieved with cooperative gold-zinc catalysts composed of an imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridinylidene ligand including a bipyridine coordination site at the C5 position. A proximity effect of the gold and zinc sites was essential for their high catalytic activity, in which the internal alkyne activated by the cationic gold species was attacked by the carboxylic acid deprotonated by the basic zinc site. Using a gold(I)-complex with a bulky aromatic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituent, 2,6-dibenzhydryl-4-methylphenyl group, for the NHC ligand facilitated seven-membered ring formation while minimizing intermolecular hydrocarboxylation as an undesired side reaction. The reaction mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective and pH&#8208;Independent Detection of Ba2+ in Water by a Benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;Functionalized BODIPY</title>

Detection of Ba2+: Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+&#8208;selective, Ba2+&#8208;sensitive and pH independent fluorescent probe with a high photostability in water (cf. TOC). This fluorescent probe is equipped with a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a highly selective Ba2+ ionophore and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore.







Abstract
Herein, we report on highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe consisting of a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore) and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter. This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12&#177;1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2&#177;0.3)&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85&#177;3 and a lower LOD of (13&#177;3)&#8197;&#956;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: From (E) to (Z)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrofluorination of alkynes provides direct access to synthetically useful monofluoroalkenes and difluoroalkanes. This review showcases the developments on this subject, from early work to recent advances on various substrates.







Abstract
The hydrofluorination of alkynes is an efficient synthetic route to monofluoroalkenes or difluoroalkanes. Both fluorinated motifs have found applications in medicinal chemistry and beyond. This review explores the recent advances in the hydrofluorination of diverse alkynes through various activation methods, from classical coinage metal catalysis to metal&#8208;free conditions. The range of alkynes goes from the simplest unactivated alkynes to activated ones (ynones and derivatives, ynamides, alkynyl sulfides and sulfones as much as haloalkynes). Regio&#8208; and stereoselective methods exists, but there is still room for improvement depending on the type of alkyne.

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanations employing eosin in the green solvent ethanol have been developed and then applied to the synthesis of colibactin warhead models. Using the models, we show what features can lead to nucleophilic addition at the cyclopropyl unit and which ones favor a ring expansion&#8208;addition sequence. We also show that copper could be responsible for catalyzing the known oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The freer it goes, the brighter it shines. Rigid structure usually shows a positive effect on the efficiency of TADF emitters. In this work, Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation of ancillary groups exhibited higher efficiency than Mc&#8208;TPA with conformationally locked ancillary groups. The macrocycle in MC&#8208;TPA made a significant contribution to the reorganization energy, leading to a severe non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92&#8201;% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6&#8201;% at 630&#8197;nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable catalysis: The development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones is accomplished. The protocol offers the regioselective synthesis of various allylated products with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed an unusual activation of Co(II)&#8208;salts using new organoreductants.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in&#8197;situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)&#8208;species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth-abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate-excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in&#8197;situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)-species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of PROTACs and SNIPERs on Backbone Amide Linked (BAL) Resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if the same chemistries and topographic diversity can be incorporated. We have examined solid&#8208;phase synthesis of both VHL&#8208;targeting PROTACS and IAP&#8208;targeting SNIPERS using backbone&#8208;amide linked (BAL resin) completing 8&#8211;11 step syntheses with products obtained with a single purification step.







Abstract
Developing straightforward but flexible approaches to PROTAC synthesis that can incorporate the structural elements of emerging designs can improve the quality and efficiency of PROTAC development. Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if diverse chemistries and topographies can be incorporated. We have exploited the backbone&#8208;amide&#8208;linked (BAL) resin to employ an array of solid&#8208;phase organic reactions, providing access to VHL&#8208; and IAP&#8208;targeting degraders using the BRD4&#8208;targeting JQ1 conjugates as examples.

         <title>The First Planar, Not Twisted, Distannene &#8211; A Structural Alkene Analog. Synthesis, Isolation and X&#8208;ray Crystallography Characterization</title>

         <dc:description>The tetrasilyl&#8208;substituted distannene, (tBu2HSi)2Sn=Sn(SiHtBu2)2 6, was synthesized by mild thermolysis (70&#176;C in hexane) of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydridosilyl)stannane 4. The X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of 6 reveals the following unusual structural properties: a planar geometry around both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn = 359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn double bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn double bond of 2.599 &#197; among all acyclic distannenes. Thus, compound 6 is the first reported distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene. Reactions of 6 with CCl4 or with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene to produce 1,2&#8208;dichlorodistannane 9 and the [2+4] cycloadduct 10, respectively, are characteristic for a Sn=Sn double bond.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylation of one of the inner core nitrogen atoms is one possible approach to obtain dianionic corrole ligands, suitable for the coordination of divalent metal ions. The inner core N&#8208;methylation can be obtained by reaction of the corrole with CH3I, but the reaction conditions should be optimized to limit the formation of the di&#8208;methylated derivative. Two regioisomers, the N&#8208;21 and the N&#8208;22 methyl derivatives are obtained from the reaction, with the first product achieved in a higher amount. The structural characterization of the reaction products evidenced the distortion induced by the introduction of the methyl groups; the N&#8208;methylcorroles are chiral compounds and the enantiomers have been separated and their absolute configuration assigned by ECD computations. The Pd insertion has been achieved in the case of monosubstituted corroles and the X&#8208;ray characterization of the complexes showed the distortion of the macrocycles. The Pd complexes do not show luminescence emission but are able to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. The Pd(II) complexes have been&#160;inserted in Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and dispersed in water: the protein protects the corroles from photobleaching and a switch from the type II to the type I mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Vectorization via Siderophores Increases Antibacterial Activity of K(RW)3 Peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics is introduced, consisting of a six amino acid long synthetic antimicrobial peptide (synAMPs) and a number of different siderophore&#8208;type vectors. Excellent activity and internalization by a (yet) unidentified receptor are key features of the new conjugates.







Abstract
A series of new conjugates comprised from a small synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a siderophore&#8208;type vector component was designed and tested for activity on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and several genetically modified strains. As AMP, the well&#8208;established arginine&#8208;tryptophane combination K(RW)3 (P1) was chosen with an added lysine for siderophore attachment. This peptide is easy to prepare, modify, and possesses good anti&#8208;bacterial activity. On the vector part, we examined several moieties: (i) the natural siderophore deferoxamine (DFO); (ii) bidentate iron chelators based on the hydroxamate building block (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) ; (iii) the non&#8208;siderophore chelators deferasirox (DFX) and deferiprone&#8208;carboxylate (DFP&#8208;COOH). All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR&#8208;MS). 55Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor&#8208;mediated uptake for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c, DFP&#8208;COOH and DFO, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of DFO. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa compared to the parent peptide P1 alone when investigated in iron&#8208;depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for P1&#8208;DFP) on wild type P. aeruginosa. The activity of P1&#8208;DFO and P1&#8208;DFP was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the DFX vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by 55Fe uptake studies, the P1&#8208;DFX conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to P1 (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor&#8208;deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of P1 and DFX confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with P1&#8208;DFP and P1&#8208;DFX being the most potent conjugates.

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transitions of short peptide&#8208;based condensates are studied by TEM and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Structural modelling based on NMR distance restraints suggests that matured droplets are stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the fibril axis and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, pointing to the possible role of such noncovalent interactions in liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes.

     alt="Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide-Based Condensate Studied by Solid-State NMR**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase transitions of short peptide-based condensates are studied by TEM and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Structural modelling based on NMR distance restraints suggests that matured droplets are stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the fibril axis and side-chain &#960;-&#960; interactions, pointing to the possible role of such noncovalent interactions in liquid-to-solid transitions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid-liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid-to-solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid-liquid and subsequent liquid-to-solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid-like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR-based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side-chain &#960;-&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid-to-solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs To Generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;Tetracarbonyl Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligands</title>

The isolation of two isomeric pyridyl&#8208;MIC chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes, which were fully characterized by IR&#8208; and EPR&#8208;spectroscopy and compared with their electrochemical&#8208;generated analogues is presented. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were conducted to get detailed information about the electronic structure of these rare complexes. This is the first time Cr(I) complexes with &#960;&#8208;acceptor ligands have been isolated and crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
Here we present stable and crystalline chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC=mesoionic carbene) ligands and weakly coordinating anions (WCA=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, RF=C(CF3)3 and BArF=[B(ArF)4]&#8722;, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). The complexes were fully characterized via crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The influence of counter anions on the IR and EPR spectroscopic properties of the CrI complexes was investigated, and the electronic innocence versus non&#8208;innocence of WCAs was probed. These are the first examples of stable and crystalline [Cr(CO)4]+ complexes with a chelating 
accepting ligand, and the data presented here are of relevance for both the photochemical and the electrochemical properties of these classes of compounds.

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area Rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiosensitizer efficiency of gold nanoparticles from laser synthesis in liquids for proton therapy was tuned and factors maximizing the production of reactive oxygen species were identified. Here, I) high particle surface areas, II) the absence of surface ligands (citrate), III) alteration of surface chemistry for example higher defect densities were identified as main contributing factors.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently the most studied radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#8217; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields by using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in&#8197;vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.

         <title>SN2 versus E2 Competition of Cyclic Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses reveal how the ring size of cyclic ethers has opposite effects on SN2 and E2 pathways and thus on the SN2/E2 competition. The preferred reaction pathway switches from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different SN2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, HO&#8722;, H3CO&#8722;, HS&#8722;, H3CS&#8722;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6&#8208; to 5&#8208; to 4&#8208; to 3&#8208;membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the SN2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the SN2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive SN2 reaction.

Six Metal Interactions: This is the first isolated tellurium and mercury containing metallaazamacrocycle which exhibits unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation. It hosts two silver ions in the skeleton and displays intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te, Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions. The intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg mercurophilic interactions connect six atoms as Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te in non&#8208;linear fashion.







Abstract
Herein, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv. of AgOTf (OTf=trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Six Metal Interactions&lt;/b&gt;: This is the first isolated tellurium and mercury containing metallaazamacrocycle which exhibits unsymmetrical figure-of-eight conformation. It hosts two silver ions in the skeleton and displays intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te, Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions. The intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg mercurophilic interactions connect six atoms as Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te in non-linear fashion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-aminophenyl)telluride and bis(&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure-of-eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv. of AgOTf (OTf=trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which afforded greenish-yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as Te&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by &lt;sup&gt;199&lt;/sup&gt;Hg, &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non-covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Nitroxide Spin Labels for Structural and Conformational Studies of Biomolecules by Maleimide Treatment</title>

Stabilizing NO radical: The instability of NO radicals in cell lysates and cells limits its application in characterizing biomolecular activity by EPR. Maleimide is shown as an effective reagent of stabilizing the NO radicals in cell lysates by preserving the intracellular confinement, enables high fidelity of EPR measurement of NO spin labelled biomolecules in maleimide treated cell lysates.







Abstract
Nitroxide (NO) spin radicals are effective in characterizing structures, interactions and dynamics of biomolecules. The EPR applications in cell lysates or intracellular milieu require stable spin labels, but NO radicals are unstable in such conditions. We showed that the destabilization of NO radicals in cell lysates or even in cells is caused by NADPH/NADH related enzymes, but not by the commonly believed reducing reagents such as GSH. Maleimide stabilizes the NO radicals in the cell lysates by consumption of the NADPH/NADH that are essential for the enzymes involved in destabilizing NO radicals, instead of serving as the solo thiol scavenger. The maleimide treatment retains the crowding properties of the intracellular components and allows to perform long&#8208;time EPR measurements of NO labeled biomolecules close to the intracellular conditions. The strategy of maleimide treatment on cell lysates for the EPR applications has been demonstrated on double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on a number of NO labeled protein samples. The method opens a broad application range for the NO labeled biomolecules by EPR in conditions that resemble the intracellular milieu.

         <title>N&#8208;Oxides as Control Element for the Direction of a Sigmatropic Rearrangement: Application as a Switch for Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>

A simple change of solvent swaps the predominance of each of these two isomers: The high affinity of the N&#8208;oxide moiety for water and other hydroxylated solvents is responsible for this unprecedented &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;. The N&#8208;oxide fragment thus serves as an &#8216;on/off&#8217; switch for fluorescence and possibly several other applications.







Abstract
An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement between N&#8208;oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favour the N&#8208;oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favour the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A N&#8208;oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding N&#8208;oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.

Allyation: The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been reported. Experimental and DFT study has been carried out to probe the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been revealed here. Under established reaction conditions, C7&#8208;allylation of various indolines, including drug compounds, was accomplished with good selectivity and yields. Based on combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, the olefin insertion route was energetically favorable among four possible pathways. Experimental and DFT studies further revealed that the C&#8722;H activation is a reversible rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene/Furan metabolization: A model cytochrome P450 enzyme was used to demonstrate that thiophene substrates were oxidized via sulfoxidation before activation towards Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization. Replacing the thiophene ring with a furan resulted in oxidative ring opening to a hydroxybutanoyl derivative, using a whole&#8208;cell system, and this reaction was demonstrated to proceed via a reactive &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid and 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X&#8208;ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4&#8208;(Furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole&#8208;cell system. This reaction proceeded via a &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in&#8197;vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Carbonylative Self&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Boronic Acids Using a Confined Pd Catalyst within Melamine Dendron and Fibrous Nano&#8208;Silica: A CO Surrogate Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A confined Pd/DN&#8208;DFNS as a heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized and used for the oxidative carbonylative synthesis of symmetric biaryl ketones from various aryl boronic acids using N&#8208;formyl saccharine as a C1 source. This catalytic system implies the recyclability of up to five consecutive cycles without loss of catalytic activity, is free of moisture&#8208;sensitive ligands and uses molecular oxygen as an oxidant and CuI as a co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Development of heterogeneous catalysts with tunable activity and selectivity has posed a persistent challenge. This study addresses this challenge by fabricating a hybrid environment through the combination of mesoporous silica and N&#8208;rich melamine dendron via covalent grafting, allowing for controllable growth and encapsulation of Pd NPs. This catalyst presented an excellent catalytic activity for the oxidative carbonylative self&#8208;coupling of aryl boronic acids to afford symmetric biaryl ketones using N&#8208;formyl saccharin as a sustainable solid CO source and Cu as a co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was first observed and analyzed in this work. It was clarified that [3]rotaxane forms a hexagonal packing type aggregation derived from hydrogen bond formation among CD units in a similar manner to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type on dispersion treatment, axle end structures, and modification of CD.







Abstract
The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane has been observed and analyzed in detail for the first time in this work. Although the hexagonal packing aggregation of CD&#8208;based polyrotaxane is a well known phenomenon, corresponding studies in terms of rotaxanes without any polymer structure have not been conducted so far, probably owing to the difficulty of the molecular design. We synthesized a series of [3]rotaxane species by using a urea&#8208;end&#8208;capping method and evaluated their aggregation behavior by XRD and SEM measurements. [3]Rotaxane species containing native CD rings showed clear signals assigned to the hexagonal packing by XRD measurement as did polyrotaxane; this proved their aggregation capability. Because the corresponding per&#8208;acetylated derivatives did not show this aggregation behavior, the driving force of this aggregation was suggested to be hydrogen bond formation among CD units. The effect of axle end structures and partial acetylation of CDs were also studied.

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8211;Guest Complexation To Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#160;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>

Improving the ADMET: The stability of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug sold under the brand name Xeloda, in an acidic environment can be improved significantly by complexation with water&#8208;soluble pillararene derivatives. These host systems also modulate the enzymatic degradation of this clinically used anticancer prodrug.







Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem, and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here, we first evaluated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings could have implications on the clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and might affect the management of cancer patients.

Novel triene&#8208;yne systems with a benzofulvene moiety were prepared and applied in the field of gold catalysis. Cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes were obtained under mild conditions and easy steps synthesis.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes (CP&#8208;anthracenes) through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of easily available triene&#8208;yne systems bearing a benzofulvene substructure, is reported. The targets are of great interest due to the potential use as organic materials and the preparation of these compounds is gaining huge importance. The applied starting materials are readily available through a three&#8208;step synthesis, which further contributes to the advantages of this route. In addition, UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescent spectra of the obtained CP&#8208;anthracenes were recorded.

         <title>2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;Based Recyclable Electroauxiliaries for the Generation of Alkyl Radicals via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;based electroauxiliaries have successfully been developed as suitable reagents for the site&#8208;selective generation of alkyl radicals. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals could be generated and several free radical reactions could be studied. The platform has the advantage of recyclability, which makes these alkyl radical precursors superior compared to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.







Abstract
Alkyl radical precursors are essential for a wide variety of photocatalytic and 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Neutral organic heterocycles as electroauxiliaries such as 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters have become reliable tools for alkyl radical formation. Here we show that 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline&#8208;derived alkyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinolines act as competent radical precursors with the ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals. Hydroalkylation of benzalmalononitriles and N&#8208;Boc protected diazenes has been achieved through copper catalysis under mild conditions of 50&#8201;&#176;C with good to very good yields of up to 85&#8201;%. Furthermore, the dihydroquinolines&#8217; reactivity towards a denitrative alkylation of nitroolefins such as &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene was discovered. Most importantly, the released biquinoline can be recycled, which greatly improves the overall atom&#8208;economy of these alkyl radical precursors in comparison to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.

1,3&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;isoindoles have been synthesized by a novel cascade reaction of divinyl ethers with substituted anilines in HFIP. Thus obtained isoindoles have been derivatized to high&#8208;order nitrogen&#8208;containing polycycles including less accessible non&#8208;symmetrical benzo[a]ullazines.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;isoindoles have been synthesized by a cascade reaction of divinyl ethers, which are derived from easily available 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins, with substituted anilines in HFIP. This cascade reaction consists of a ring&#8208;opening step through addition&#8208;elimination mechanism and the following 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet type ring&#8208;closing step via the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. Thus obtained 2H&#8208;isoindoles have been derivatized to high&#8208;order nitrogen&#8208;containing polycycles including less accessible benzo[a]ullazines.

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coordination to a pyridine&#8208;based arylene ethynylene provides an expedient pathway to encapsulated molecular rotors or turnstiles. With the modularity of the synthetic design, this strategy provides access to a wide variety of encapsulated turnstile&#8208;type structures. X&#8208;ray crystallography, solution 1H&#8197;NMR, and solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR provide insight into the potential for rotation of the central unit.







Abstract
Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotators encapsulated within macrocyclic stators. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotators, X&#8208;ray crystallography of AgI&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for unobstructed rotation or wobbling of rotators within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR of PdII&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon the introduction of PdII to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.

A game&#8208;changing generation of new protease assay substrates have been developed by using the nitrobenzofurazane (NBD) fluorophore. With applications across different protease classes, this breakthrough promises to decisively improve fluorometric assays in protease drug discovery.







Abstract
Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50&#8197;years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Herein, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.

         <title>Cover Feature: Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes (Chem. Eur. J. 50/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane formed aggregation structures under the appropriate conditions, as was clearly observed for the first time. Detailed study of this phenomenon revealed that [3]rotaxane aggregated with hexagonal packing owing to hydrogen bond formation among CD units, in a manner similar to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type upon dispersion, through the axle end structures, and by modification of CD. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Akae and P. Theato (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301582).

The reversible oxidation of chromium tetracarbonyl complexes with bidentate &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands is a rare phenomenon, as the resulting electron deficiency at the metal center is often accompanied by subsequent CO dissociation. The incorporation of highly &#963;&#8208;donating pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbenes (py&#8208;MIC) facilitates the stabilization of highly reactive 17 VE species, while retaining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. In combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCA), it was possible to isolate for the first time stable and crystalline CrI tetracarbonyl complexes with &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Sarkar and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301205).

We've got you surrounded! Conjugated units that are encapsulated within the cavities of macrocycles can have unique properties often including the ability to rotate or wobble within an otherwise stationary crystal lattice. We introduce a strategy for forming macrocycles of this type in only a few synthetic steps using pyridine coordination to transition metals as the final, ring&#8208;closing step. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;P.&#8197;Bowling and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301745).

         <title>Materials for Electrochemiluminescence: TADF, Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, and Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 50, September 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances towards enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) using novel design strategies such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminophores (both donor&#8208;acceptor and multiresonance), hydrogen&#8208;bonding complexes, and aggregation&#8208; and crystallization&#8208;induced emission strategies. In many scenarios, the ECL enhancement is shown to be significant, thus suggesting future applications for thin film optoelectronics and sensing. These new avenues of intelligent ECL luminophore designs are expected to be of great importance for ECL&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single&#8208;molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry, which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this review, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.

         <title>The &#8220;How&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8221; Behind the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide by Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>

A controlled and orthogonal derivatization of the alkene groups of graphene oxide can be achieved by thiol&#8208;ene radical addition and thiol&#8208;ene Michael addition. The reaction is triggered by either the addition of radical initiators or base catalysts.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp2 hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO&#8208;based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer from low control and undesirable side reactions, including by&#8208;product formation and GO reduction. Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by&#8208;products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by&#8208;product formation. We anticipate that multi&#8208;functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Chelation in the p&#8208;Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been the subject of considerable study since the field&#8217;s inception. While much of the research into FLPs has centered around small molecule activation for diverse stoichiometric and catalytic transformations, intramolecular FLPs also show promise as chelating ligands. The cooperative action of Lewis basic and acidic moieties enables intramolecular FLPs to stabilize low oxidation state centers and (consequently) reactive molecular fragments through a donor&#8208;acceptor approach, making them an attractive ligand class in main group element chemistry. This review outlines the state of FLP chelation to date throughout the p&#8208;block, encompassing primarily groups 13&#8211;16.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges in the Direct Detection of Chirality&#8208;induced Spin Selectivity: Investigation of Foldamer&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect was reported in several experiments disclosing a unique connection between chirality and electron spin. Recent theoretical works highlighted time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (trEPR) as a powerful tool to directly detect the spin polarization resulting from CISS.
Here, we report a first attempt to detect CISS at the molecular level by linking the pyrene electron donor to the fullerene acceptor with chiral peptide bridges of different lengths and electric dipole moment. The dyads are investigated by an array of techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, steady&#8208;state and transient optical spectroscopies, and trEPR. Despite the promising energy alignment of the electronic levels, our multi&#8208;technique analysis reveals no evidence of electron transfer (ET), highlighting the challenges of spectroscopic detection of CISS. However, the analysis allows the formulation of guidelines for the design of chiral organic model systems suitable to directly probe CISS&#8208;polarized ET.</dc:description>

         <title>The origin of delayed polymorphism in molecular crystals under mechanochemical conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that mechanochemically driven polymorphic transformations can require
extremely long induction periods, which can be tuned from hours to days by changing
ball milling energy. The robust design and interpretation of ball milling experiments
must account for this unexpected kinetics that arises from energetic phenomena unique
to the solid state. Detailed thermal analysis, combined with DFT simulations, indicates
that these marked induction periods are associated with processes of mechanical
activation. Correspondingly, we show that the pre&#8208;activation of reagents can also lead
to marked changes in the length of induction periods. Our findings demonstrate a new
dimension for exerting control over polymorphic transformations in organic crystals.
We expect mechanical activation to have a much broader implication across organic
solid&#8208;state mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>PI and PIII ions supported by BZIMPY ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a class of compounds in which both PIII&#8208;X and PI forms featuring the same ligand are stable and readily cycled with each other. A series of PIII&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br, I) dicationic triflate salts supported by benzyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;substituted 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands is synthesized. Surprisingly, treatment of these with R3PO (R = Et, Oct) results in reduction to BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI monocationic triflate salts while treatment with Ph3P reduces but also substitutes the compound to produce Ph3P&#8208;BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI dicationic triflate salts. The mechanisms of these surprising reductions are probed experimentally and rationalized computationally. The PIII&#8208;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X+, PX, and P+ transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The PI mono&#8208; and dications are shown to be very effective P+ transfer agents when treated similarly. Oxidation from a monocationic PI salt back to the dicationic PIII&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) salt was achieved by treatment with N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). Full characterization is reported using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry where suitable crystals were isolated.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;activated and RGD&#8208;conjugated Ultrasmall Fe/PPy Nanopolymers for Enhanced Tumor Photothermal Ferrotherapy and MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown great promise for tumor ferrotherapy in recent years. However, nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis has low therapeutic efficacy owing to unsatisfactory Fenton reaction activity in a typical tumor microenvironment. We herein developed NIR light&#8208;activated Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD nanopolymers to combine photothermal therapy and ferrotherapy and achieve enhanced antitumor activity. Importantly, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD exhibited excellent therapeutic performance under NIR light activation both&#160;in vitro&#160;and in vivo. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also&#160;enhanced&#160;the release of iron ions and&#160;the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, by virtue of RGD conjugation and its ultrasmall size, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD could effectively accumulate at tumor sites in living mice after systemic administration and could be monitored via MR imaging. Hence, this study provides a promising approach for integrating ferrotherapy with photothermal therapy to achieve enhanced tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Hydroaminodifluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Undescribed aminosulfinates enabled the preparation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylamines in a photocatalyzed addition reaction of the corresponding aminodifluoroalkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient, electron&#8208;rich alkenes and vinylaryls or unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
The synthesis of undescribed &#946;&#8208;aminodifluoroethylsulfinates and their uses in the hydroaminodifluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported. This reaction is performed in the presence of a photocatalyst (4CzIPN, Ru complexes) and enables the direct incorporation of a &#946;&#8208;difluoroamine moiety into vinylic aryls, unactivated alkenes, and electron&#8208;rich, or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanism was studied, and the formation of a gem&#8208;difluoromethyl radical was observed after the selective oxidation of the sulfinate function.

         <title>Emissive Click Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click reaction has been used to make covalent organic cages with tetraphenyl ethylene and tetrabiphenyl ethylene AIEgens. The emissive cages exhibit enhanced aggregation induced emission and detect picric acid in nanomolar quantity in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of cofacial organic cage molecules containing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) through four&#8208;fold Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) &#8220;click&#8221; reactions. The shorter AIEgen, tetraphenylethylene (TPE), afforded two orientational isomers (TPE&#8208;CC&#8208;1A and TPE&#8208;CC&#8208;1B). The longer AIEgen, tetrabiphenylethylene (TBPE), afforded a single isomer (TBPE&#8208;CC&#8208;2). The click reaction employed is irreversible, yet it yielded remarkable four&#8208;fold click products above 40&#8201;%. The phenyl rings around the ethylene core generate propeller&#8208;shaped chirality owing to their orientation, which influences the chirality of the resulting cages. The shorter cages are a mixture of PP/MM isomers, while the longer ones are a mixture of PM/MP isomers, as evidenced by their x&#8208;ray structures. The newly synthesized cage molecules are emissive even in dilute solutions (THF) and exhibit enhanced AIE upon the addition of water. The aggregated cage molecules in aqueous solution exhibit turn&#8208;off emission sensing of nitroaromatic explosives, with selectivity to picric acid in the 25&#8211;38 nanomolar detection range.

         <title>Multiple Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts Enhance the Asymmetric Cyanation of Ketimines and Aldimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. This catalytic system is distinguished by its low catalyst loading (S/C up to 1000), high efficiency, extremely broad substrate scope, scalability and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. The catalytic strategy was characterized with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), easily accessible catalysts with diverse functional groups, and catalytic base additives. A wide range of imines, including the challenging N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.

         <title>5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as a Functional Platform for Peptide Stapling and Multicyclisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as a widely applicable scaffold for the stapling and multicyclisation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. A robust and peptide&#8208;compatible Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution between aromatic fluorides and cysteine thiols was performed with a library of peptides, leading to different cyclic species &#8211; one of which was biologically tested &#8211; and offering relevant synthetic insights.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated aromatic reagents readily react with thiolates via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and provide excellent scaffolds for peptide cyclisation. Here we report a robust and versatile platform for peptide stapling and multicyclisation templated by 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, opening the door to the next generation of functional scaffolds for 3D peptide architectures. We demonstrate that stapling and multicyclisation occurs with a range of non&#8208;protected peptides under peptide&#8208;compatible conditions, exhibiting chemoselectivity and wide&#8208;applicability. Peptides containing two cysteine residues are readily stapled, and the remaining perfluoroaryl groups permit the introduction of a second peptide in a modular fashion to access bicyclic peptides. Similarly, peptides with more than two cysteine residues can afford multicyclic products containing up to three peptide &#8216;loops&#8217;. Finally, we demonstrate that a porphyrin&#8208;templated stapled peptide containing the Skin Penetrating and Cell Entering (SPACE) peptide affords a skin cell penetrating conjugate with intrinsic fluorescence.

         <title>Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of fluorous polyaromatic hydrocarbons via the arene&#8208;fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction offers a fast and clean synthetic route to highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of interest for organic electronics. The development of long&#8208;range noncovalent arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions enables the formation of broader and thermally more stable mesophases than their hydrogenated counterparts, as well as supramolecular luminescent gels and films.







Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is described, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraalkoxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 3,4&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1&#8208;bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double&#8208;lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;6,7,10,11&#8208;tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetraalkoxybenzo[f]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16&#8208;octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17&#8208;octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[a,c,j,l]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacking driven by the establishment of non&#8208;covalent perfluoroarene&#8208;arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;&#8208;extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.

         <title>Synthesis of Hierarchical CdS/NiS Photocatalysts Using Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 as Template for Efficient Ethanol Conversion and Hydrogen Production under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8722;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The prepared photocatalyst can efficiently convert ethanol while producing a large amount of hydrogen gas and exhibits excellent photocatalytic stability.







Abstract
The conversion of ethanol into high&#8208;valuable chemicals and H2 by photocatalytic process provides a sustainable approach to produce carbon&#8208;chain&#8208;prolonged chemicals and hydrogen energy. In this article, Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8722;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst was subjected to photocatalytic ethanol conversion, and the hierarchical composite material CdS/NiS&#8722;N (100) formed by adding 100&#8197;mg of Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and stability in an ethanol aqueous solution with a water content of 10&#8201;%. Under visible light irradiation, the conversion rate of ethanol reached 15.2&#8201;% at the photocatalytic reaction of 5&#8197;h. The selectivity of 2,3&#8208;butanediol(2,3&#8208;BDO) was 25&#8201;%, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde(AA) was 63&#8201;%. Through various characterizations, it has been proven that a large specific surface area and the coupling interface between CdS and NiS are key factors in improving photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing photocatalysts with coupled cocatalysts/semiconductors and large specific surface areas.

An inspiring collaboration between pharmaceutical industry and academia enabled discovery, structure elucidation, and biosynthetic pathway analysis of streptnatamide A, a new cyclic peptide isolated from secondary metabolites of a marine invertebrate&#8208;associated Streptomyces sp. This study highlights the application of mass spectrometry tools that enables the rapid unambiguous structure elucidation of this complex molecule.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides have been excellent source of drug leads. With the advances in discovery platforms, the pharmaceutical industry has a growing interest in cyclic peptides and has pushed several into clinical trials. However, structural complexity of cyclic peptides brings extreme challenges for structure elucidation efforts. Isotopic fine structure analysis, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and detailed tandem mass spectrometry rapidly provided peptide sequence for streptnatamide A, a cyclic peptide isolated from a marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. Marfey's analysis determined the stereochemistry of all amino acids, enabling the unambiguous structure determination of this compound. A non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.

Direction signs show a driver which turn to take to reach the desired destination. In a similar manner, the course of triyne cyclization can be diverted by the appropriate choice of reaction conditions: catalysis promotes the [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization pathway, whereas high temperatures induce a dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hapke, M. Kotora, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301491).

         <title>Inhibition of Amyloid &#946; Aggregation and Cytotoxicity by Berbamine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibitory effects of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH) on A&#946; aggregation were comprehensively evaluated using several widely&#8208;used biophysical assays. Furthermore, the inhibitory mechanisms of BBMH were elucidated through SPR analysis and chemical kinetics analysis. These findings suggest that bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids hold great promise in the battle against Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking results further revealed that BBMH could bind to A&#946; fibrils, thereby hindering the aggregation process. This physical picture has been confirmed in a quantitative way by chemical kinetics analysis, which showed BBMH tends to bind with the fibril ends and thus prevents the transition from protofibrils to mature fibrils as well as the elongation process. Additionally, our MTT results showed that BBMH was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 on N2a cells. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of BBMH to inhibit A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity, offering a promising direction for further research and drug development efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Biochar&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Porous Carbon as Tellurium Host for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Tellurium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium ion battery is promising for its high abundance and low redox potential. As a conversion cathode, Te possesses high conductivity and theoretical volumetric capacity to couple with potassium. The stubborn issues of K&#8208;Te battery focus on the large volume change and rapid structure degradation of Te. Herein, we produce biomass carbon from mangosteen shell in a facile method, and obtain a hierarchical porous host with abundance of micropores and mesopores, which is beneficial for hosting Te during K+ storage in K&#8208;Te battery obviously. The specific capacity reach to 560 mAh g&#8208;1 in the initial cycle at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and remained 83.8% after 200 cycles. Impressively, at a high current density of 2.0 A g&#8208;1, the specific capacity still remained 62.6% after 5000 cycle. These results endow such strategy an efficient way for the development of K&#8208;Te batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fate of Oxidation States at Actinide Centers in Redox&#8208;Active Ligand Systems Governed by Energy Levels of 5f Orbitals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the formation of a NpIV complex from the complexation of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; = 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)iminomethyl]pyridine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the direct complexation&#8208;induced chemical reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV. In contrast, the complexation of UVIO22+ with tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+, not even after the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reduction of [UVIO2(tBu&#8208;pdiop)]. This contrast between the Np and U systems may be ascribed to the decrease of the energy of the 5f orbitals in Np compared to those in U. The present findings indicate that the redox chemistry between UVIO22+ and NpVIO22+ should be clearly differentiated in redox&#8208;active ligand systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Graphene Oxide: Unveiling Structural Properties and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical exfoliation method for the production of graphene oxide and its characterization by electrochemical techniques are presented here. Graphite rods are used as working electrode in a three&#8208;electrode electrochemical cell, and electro&#8208;exfoliation is achieved by applying anodic polarization in a sulfuric acid solution. The electrochemical process involved two steps characterized by an intercalation at lower potential and an exfoliation at higher potential. The electrochemical behavior of the produced GO is studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X ray Photoelectronic Spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize the structural and chemical properties of the synthesized GO. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical exfoliation method yieldsd GO materials with varying degrees of oxidation, defect density, and crystallite size, depending on the applied potential and acid concentration. The graphene oxide samples exhibite distinct electrochemical properties, including charge transfer resistance, interfacial capacitance, and relaxation times for the charge transfer, as revealed by CV and EIS measurements with a specifically selected redox probe. The comprehensive characterization provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of the GO materials synthesized through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable&#160;Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Transformation of White Phosphorous (P4) into&#160;P1&#160;Organo&#8208;compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental white phosphorous (P4) is a crucial feedstock for the entire phosphorus&#8208;derived chemical industry, serving as a common precursor for the ultimate preparation of high&#8208;grade monophosphorus (P1) fine chemicals. Whereas the corresponding manufacturing processes generally suffer from a deep reliance on hazardous reagents, inputs of immense energy, emissions of toxic pollutants, and the generation of substantial waste, which in turn contributes to negative impacts on the environment. In this context, sustainability and safety concerns maintain a consistent impetus for the urgent overall improvement of phosphorus cycles. &#160;In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent growth in photo&#8208; and electrochemical synthesis of P1&#160;organo&#8208;compounds from P4&#160;with special emphasis on sustainable features.&#160;The key aspects of innovations regarding activation mode and mechanism have been compressively analyzed. A preliminary outlook on the possible development of future direction is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Properties of Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies Made of N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the absorption spectra and photophysical properties of homo and hetero&#8208;aggregate assemblies of a strongly emissive N&#8208;annulated perylene dye (P) and of a dyad made of P and a methyl viologen derivative (P&#8208;MV), in ethanol&#8208;water solutions. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P, the strong &#960;&#8722;&#960;* fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is replaced by an excimer emission at lower energy, with a lifetime of 900 ps, due to excimer formation from the initially prepared excitons. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P&#8208;MV, photoinduced charge separation, with formation of P+&#8208;MV&#8208; species, occurs in 3 ps and with a charge recombination of 20 ps, close to the time constants of the same processes exhibited by P&#8208;MV isolated dyad in acetonitrile or ethanol solution. In mixed hetero&#8208;aggregate P/P&#8208;MV systems, the light energy absorbed by the P components is suggested to delocalizes (by exciton formation) over various P subunits, and when a P&#8208;MV unit is reached, charge separation occurs; however, excimer emission is still present, particularly for P/P&#8208;MV ratio larger than 3:1, indicating that delocalized excitons within the hetero&#8208;aggregate systems extend over a limited, small number of P chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing Nanozymatic Activity of Copper&#8208;Functionlized Mesoporous C3N5 for Sensing of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing unique nanomaterials for the selective sensing of biomolecules is of significant interest in the field of nanobiotechnology. In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of ordered and Cu nanoparticles functionalized mesoporous C3N5 with unique peroxidase like nanozymatic activity for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of glucose and glutathione.&#160; A nano hard&#8208;templating technique together with the in&#8208;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of Cu and high N&#8208;containing CN precursor was adopted to introduce mesoporosity as well as high N and Cu content in mesoporous C3N5. Due to the ordered structure and highly dispersed Cu in the mesoporous C3N5, a large enhancement of the peroxidase mimetic activity in the oxidation of a redox dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be obtained.&#160; Additionally, the optimized Cu functionalized mesoporous C3N5 exhibited excellent sensitivity to glutathione with a low detection limit of 2.0 ppm. The strong peroxidase activity of the Cu functionalized mesoporous C3N5 was also effectively used for the sensing of glucose with the detection limit of 0.4 mM through glucose oxidation with glucose oxidase. This unique Cu functionalized mesoporous C3N5 has the potential for detecting various molecules in the environment as well as for next&#8208;generation glucose and glutathione diagnostic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Biasing the Formation of Solution&#8208;Unstable Intermediates in Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the reversible nature of coordination bonds and solvation effect, coordination self&#8208;assembly pathways are often difficult to elucidate experimentally in solution, as intermediates and products are in constant equilibration. Herein, we showed that some of these transient and high&#8208;energy self&#8208;assembly intermediates can be accessed by means of ball&#8208;milling approaches. Among them, highly aqueous&#8208;unstable Pd3L11 and Pd6L14 open&#8208;cage intermediates of the framed Fujita Pd6L14 cage and Pd2L22, Pd3L21 and Pd4L22 intermediates of Mukherjee Pd6L24 capsule are successfully trapped in solid&#8208;state, where L1 = 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and L2 = 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene). Their structures are assigned by a combination of solution&#8208;based characterization tools such as standard NMR spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Collectively, our result highlights the opportunity of using mechanochemistry to access unique chemical space with vastly different reactivity compared to conventional solution&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assembly reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Crystallinity and Stability in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability pose significant challenges for practical applications. Although a growing number of robust COFs have been developed and employed for a broad scope of applications, the assessment of COF stability has primarily relied on qualitative descriptions, lacking a rational and quantitative assessment. Herein, we for the first time present a novel assessment method that enables visual and quantitative depiction of COF stability. By analyzing the PXRD patterns of chemically stable &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;based COFs (KEA&#8208;COFs), we establish two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters, the relative intensity (I2&#952;rel) and the relative area (A2&#952;rel) of the main peak (2&#952;), which are expected to establish a standardized criterion for assessing COF crystallinity. Based on these parameters, the crystalline changes after stability tests can be visually presented, which provides a rational and quantitative assessment of their stability. This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA&#8208;COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217;crystallinity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by low&#8208;valent main group compounds represent an attractive gateway toward their functionalization for stoichiometric transformations and catalytic applications. This review is aimed to cover the different pathways in C6 aromatic hydrocarbon activation that have been achieved in the past few decades.







Abstract
The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth's crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E=main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Luminescent Dyes: From Theoretical Insight to Experimental Evidence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ESPT, or not to ESPT: Efficient use of luminescent dyes requires understanding their excitation and relaxation pathways like Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT). Experimental demonstration is challenging due to competing phenomena. A holistic approach, merging experimental results, computational analysis, and diverse mechanism assessment, is vital for ESPT verification, affecting molecular probes, sensors, and related applications.







Abstract
The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes&#8242; shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding on the proton conductivity of COFs was investigated. It was shown that the extrinsic proton carriers could increase the proton conductivity of DaTta, which originally had negligible proton conductivity due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, to 0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#8201;&#176;C/98&#8201;% RH by breaking the intramolecular H&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta)&lt;&#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) under 100&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.

         <title>Interaction Between the Transferrin Protein and Plutonium (and Thorium), What's New?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloprotein: With a toolbox of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, this work sheds light on the binding interaction of plutonium and thorium (early actinides at oxidation state +IV) with iron transport transferrin protein and its tertiary structure.







Abstract
Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with metals other than Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics. We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M=Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8722;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of Deferoxamine&#8208;B (DFOB) in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered:holoTf&lt;M2Tf (M=Th, Pu)&lt;apoTf&lt;M2Tf&#8208;DFOB (M=Fe, Th, Pu).

         <title>Platinum(IV)&#8211;Gold(I) Agents with Promising Anticancer Activity: Selected Studies in 2D and 3D Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two are better than one, heterometallic anticancer agents continue to impress: A Platinum(IV)&#8211;gold(I) agent inhibits several TNBC cancer hallmarks with no decreased drug sensitivity in 3D spheroids versus 2D cell culture models, inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in cells at concentrations five times lower than the IC50 value.







Abstract
New heterometallic binuclear and trinuclear platinum(IV)&#8211;gold(I) compounds of the type [Pt(L)nCl2(OH){(OOC&#8208;4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PPh2)AuCl}x] (L=NH3, n=2; x=1, 2; L=diaminocyclohexane, DACH, n=1; x=2) are described. These compounds are cytotoxic and selective against a small panel of renal, bladder, ovarian, and breast cancer cell lines. We selected a trinuclear PtAu2 compound containing the PtIV core based on oxaliplatin, to further investigate its cell&#8208;death pathway, cell and organelle uptake and anticancer effects against the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. This compound induces apoptosis and accumulates mainly in the nucleus and mitochondria. It also exerts remarkable antimigratory and antiangiogenic properties, and has a potent cytotoxic effect against TNBC 3D spheroids. Trinuclear compounds do not seem to display relevant interactions with calf thymus (CT) DNA and plasmid (pBR322) even in the presence of reducing agents, but inhibit pro&#8208;angiogenic enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in TNBC cells.

         <title>A Tetradentate Ligand Enables Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Ketones in a CO&#8208; or Isocyanide&#8208;Free Fashion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton was reported. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.







Abstract
We herein reported the design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand that is featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Hydride donor lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) converted non&#8208;reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.

Hydride donor lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) converted non-reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Ammonia by Flow Plasma Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzene is demonstrated with a plasma microreactor. Using ammonia plasma, this process was optimized by studying the influence of temperature, residence time and power of the plasma. Various compounds were evaluated to study influence of double bond, conjugation, and aromaticity. Under optimized conditions, direct amination of benzene gave of total yield of 3.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a microreactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8&#8201;% and a selectivity of 49&#8201;% in various amino compounds.

         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;component tetrafluoroethylation reaction of alkenes induced by visible light has been developed using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylsulfonyl chloride and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a facile approach to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules under mild conditions, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active and drug molecules.







Abstract
1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.

         <title>Spontaneous Decoration of Ultrasmall Pt Nanoparticles on Size&#8208;Separated MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size of liquid exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets plays a crucial role in determining nanoparticle decoration densities in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid into ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles.







Abstract
Liquid exfoliation can be considered as a viable approach for the scalable production of 2D materials due to its various benefits, although the polydispersity in the obtained nanosheet size hinders their straightforward incorporation. Size&#8208;separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size&#8208;specific applicability. Herein, size&#8208;selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation&#8208;based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size&#8208;activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets was evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.

         <title>Revisiting sp2 Dilithio Methandiides: From Geometric Curiosity to Simple Bonding Description</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intriguing tetracoordinate geometry of a dilithio methandiide complex is probed from a coordination chemistry perspective, demonstrating the sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the methandiide carbon and the other (non&#8208;covalent) interactions responsible for its planarity.







Abstract
The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8722;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome lattice: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D covalent organic frameworks with kagome (kgm) topology are a promising class of crystalline frameworks that possess both triangular micropores and hexagonal mesopores. These dual&#8208;pore structures enable kgm COFs to exhibit unique advantages in selective separation, mass transfer, and targeted drug release. However, the synthesis of 2D kgm COFs has been hindered by the reliance on empirical methods. In this review, we systematically summarize the conventional macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework strategy, typical [4+2] co&#8208;polymerization synthetic strategy, and bifunctional molecules self&#8208;condensation approach for constructing 2D kgm COFs. We also survey the factors influencing formation of kgm lattice such as monomer type, solvent polarity, substrate concentration, etc., and highlight the representative examples on targeted synthesis. Additionally, we summarize the applications of 2D kgm COFs and the relationships between structure and performances. Finally, we propose key fundamental perspectives to accelerate the further development of this intriguing material.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The design of non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most essential issue to the realization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the pyridine&#8208;N and graphitized&#8208;N produced during calcination also could provide more active sites and increase the electrical conductivity. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (OER/ORR) based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon. Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows more advantageous &#916;E value (0.70 V) compared to Pt/C + RuO2 (0.73 V) and most reported catalysts. Additionally, the Zinc&#8208;Air Batterie (ZAB) employing Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC as air cathode shows excellent performance. The maximum power density of 203.48 mW cm&#8722;2, the cycling stability of more than 150 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Stereochemical Communication and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chiroptical Properties in Biphenyl&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical materials are gaining increasing interest due to their innovative character and their applications in optoelectronics and data encryption technologies. Fully harnessing the potential of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221; such as, for example, native cyclodextrins (CDs), as they often lack chromophores suitable for the construction of materials with significant chiroptical properties. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a two&#8208;level molecular stack consisting of a point&#8208;chiral element (CD) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in CDs into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Permethylated CDs were efficiently capped with two different 2,2&#8217;&#8208;difunctionalized 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl units. In CD derivatives containing the rigid 2,2'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl cap, two intramolecular hydrogen bonds act synergistically as stereoselective actuators, enabling effective communication between the two levels and the transfer of non&#8208;chromophoric stereochemical information from the cyclooligosaccharide to the atropoisomeric cap. The chiroptical properties can be finely tuned by external stimuli such as temperature and solvent. The way chirality is transferred from the CD platform to the biphenyl cap was revealed thanks to crystallographic and computational analyses, together with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Liposome Compartment with Size Exclusion Molecular Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cellular compartment plays an essential role in organizing the complex and diverse biochemical reactions within the cell. By mimicking the function of such cellular compartments, the challenge of constructing artificial compartments has been taken up to develop new biochemical tools for efficient material production and diagnostics. The important features required for the artificial compartment are that it isolates the interior from the external environment and is further functionalized to control the transport of target chemicals to regulate the interior concentration of both substrate and reaction products. In this study, we have constructed an artificial compartment with a size&#8208;selective molecular transport function by using a DNA origami&#8208;guided liposome prepared by modifying the method reported by Perrault et al. This completely isolates the liposome interior, including the DNA origami skeleton, from the external environment and allows the assembly of a defined number of molecules of interest inside and/or outside the compartment. By incorporating a bacterial membrane protein, OmpF, into the liposome, the resulting artificial compartment was shown to transport only the molecule of interest with a molecular weight below 600 Da from the external environment into the interior of the compartment.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis and Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Strained Carbo&#8208; and Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;organic synthesis has become an established and environmentally benign tool for initiating chemical transformations. This review summarizes the electrochemical synthesis and ring&#8208;opening reactions of three&#8208;membered strained rings, and particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis with biological importance. Moreover, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings leads to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization through C&#8208;&gt;C, C&#8208;&gt;N, and C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods for these molecules require the use of acid catalysts or transition metals. Recently, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.

Regioselectively controlled C&#8722;H&#8208;activated direct arylation reactions of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrroles (DTP) are presented providing novel regioselectively substituted DTPs with N&#8208;aryl, unprecedented &#946;&#8208;aryl and &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;diaryl, as well &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208;diaryl scaffolds depending on the catalytic system and substitution at the DTP nitrogen.







Abstract
In this study, regioselectively controlled direct arylation of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrroles (DTPs) is reported. By carefully selecting the catalytic system, Pd source, ligand, and additives, we achieved either selective N&#8208;arylation or unprecedented &#946;&#8208;arylation and &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;diarylation of the DTP core through C&#8722;H activation when reacting unsubstituted H&#8208;DTP with 9&#8208;anthracenyl halides. For N&#8208;substituted DTPs, we obtained regioselective carboxylate&#8208;assisted arylation of the &#945;&#8208;position(s). Consequently, depending on the catalytic system and substitution at the DTP nitrogen, we successfully synthesized novel regioselectively substituted DTPs, including N&#8208;aryl, rarely reported &#946;&#8208;aryl, &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;diaryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208;diaryl scaffolds. These compounds can be straightforwardly prepared and further functionalized for applications as organic electronic materials.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred molecular recognition of aromatics in spherical M12L8 metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) has been studied in consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions combining single&#8208;crystal&#8208;XRD (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis, DFT calculations, and solid&#8208;state NMR. Computed DFT host&#8211;guest energy interactions (Ehost&#8211;guest) showed a good match with the observed molecular recognition and the rotational behaviour of the pyridine rings in the M12L8 nanocages (low rotational energy barrier &#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Considering the structure&#8211;function properties observed in M12L8, the metal&#8211;organic structures could be used in sensing applications.







Abstract
In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8211;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.&#8201;e., spherical) M12L8 MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported. The guest absorption was monitored directly in the solid&#8208;state by consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas&#8208;solid environment, in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments.

Combining SC&#8208;XRD, DFT and solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M12L8 cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties were rationalized by considering the presence of mechanical bonds (efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine's rotor&#8208;like behaviour (with 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8211;function properties of M12L8 makes 1 a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.

     alt="Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The preferred molecular recognition&lt;/b&gt; of aromatics in spherical M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) has been studied in consecutive single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) reactions combining single-crystal-XRD (SC-XRD) analysis, DFT calculations, and solid-state NMR. Computed DFT host&#8211;guest energy interactions (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;host&#8211;guest&lt;/sub&gt;) showed a good match with the observed molecular recognition and the rotational behaviour of the pyridine rings in the M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; nanocages (low rotational energy barrier &#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Considering the structure&#8211;function properties observed in M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, the metal&#8211;organic structures could be used in sensing applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8211;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.&#8201;e., spherical) M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; MOCs within poly-[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]-catenane (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is reported. The guest absorption was monitored directly in the solid-state by consecutive single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas-solid environment, in single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) experiments. The preferential guest uptake was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8211;guest interaction energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;host&#8211;guest&lt;/sub&gt;) with a nitrobenzene (NB)&#8811;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xy)&#8811;&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-dichlorobenzene (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-DCB) trend (i.&#8201;e., from 44 to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC-XRD, DFT and solid-state &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties were rationalized by considering the presence of &lt;i&gt;mechanical bonds&lt;/i&gt; (efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine's &lt;i&gt;rotor-like&lt;/i&gt; behaviour (with 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8211;function properties of M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; makes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Designing chiral ligands with an axial symmetry higher than C2&#8208;rotational symmetry is one of the most crucial approaches to improving enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, we report C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution using a Nickel&#8208;based Calixpyrrole Complex: Controlling the Secondary Coordination Sphere on an Electrode Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating design elements from homogeneous catalysts to construct well defined active sites on electrode surfaces is a promising approach for developing next generation electrocatalyst for energy conversion reactions. Furthermore, if functionalities that control the electrode microenvironment could be integrated into these active sites it would be particularly appealing. In this context, we report a square planar nickel calixpyrrole complex, Ni(DPMDA) (DPMDA= 2,2'&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)bis(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5,2&#8208;diyl))bis(methaneylylidene))bis(azaneylylidene))dianiline) with pendant amine groups that forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. The supported Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was surprisingly robust and displayed fast reaction kinetics with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900 s&#8208;1 or 366,000 s&#8208;1&#183;cm&#8208;2. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies revealed a KIE of 5.7, and this data, combined with Tafel slope analysis, suggested that a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was rate&#8208;limiting. While evidence of poor electronic coupling between the electrode and the Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was observed, it is hypothesized that the control over the secondary coordination sphere provided by the pendant amines facilitated such high TOFs and enabled the PCET mechanism. The results reported herein provide insight into heterogeneous catalyst design and approaches for controlling the secondary coordination sphere on electrode surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Qubit in a 2D&#160;GdIIINaI&#8208;based Oxamato Supramolecular Coordination Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Qubits are the basic unit of quantum information and computation. To realize quantum computing and information processing, the decoherence times of qubits must be long enough. Among the studies of molecule&#8208;based electron spin qubits, most of the work focused on the ions with the spin S = 1/2, where only single&#8208;bit gates can be constructed. However, quantum operations require the qubits to interact with each other, so people gradually carry out relevant research in ions or systems with S &gt; 1/2 and multilevel states. In this work, we selected a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIIINaI&#8208;based oxamato supramolecular coordination framework, Na[Gd(4&#8208;HOpa)4(H2O)]&#8729;2H2O (1, 4&#8208;HOpa = N&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenyloxamate), as a possible carrier of qubit. The field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation shows this system has&#160;phonon bottleneck (PB) effect at low temperatures with a very weak magnetic anisotropy. The pause electron paramagnetic resonance studies show the spin&#8208;lattice and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times are T1 = 1.66 ms at 4 K and Tm = 4.25 &#956;s at 8 K for its diamagnetically diluted sample (1Gd0.12%). It suggested that the relative long decoherence time is mainly ascribed to its near isotropic and the PB effect from resonance phonon trapped for pure sample, while the dilution further improves its qubit performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Additive Manufacturing of Hydrazone linked Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous organic materials. Recent studies have demonstrated novel processing strategies for COFs to form adaptable architectures, but these have focused primarily on imine&#8208;linked COFs. &#160;In this work, we present a new synthesis and processing route to produce crystalline hydrazone&#8208;linked COF gels and aerogels with hierarchical porosity. &#160;We implemented this method to produce a series of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs with different alkyl side&#8208;chain substituents and demonstrate that we can control the hydrophilicity of the final aerogel. Variation in the length of the alkyl substituents yielded materials with controllable form factors that can preferentially adsorb water or nonpolar organic solvents. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for additive manufacturing of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs using hydroxymethylcellulose as a sacrificial additive. &#160;This work demonstrates an effective and simple approach to the fabrication of hydrazone COF aerogels and additive manufacturing to produce hydrazone COFs of desired shape.</dc:description>

         <title>Is Enol Always the Culprit? The Curious Case of High Enantioselectivity in a Chiral Rh(II) Complex Catalyzed Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4&#160;catalyzed carbene insertion into C(3)&#8211;H of indole is investigated using DFT methods. Previously proposed mechanisms involved a metal&#8208;free enol intermediate, which&#160;naturally raises a conundrum regarding the mode of chiral induction. We now propose a new mechanistic pathway involving a metal&#8208;associated enol intermediate and stereochemical model to solve this puzzle. We show how the catalyst bowl&#8208;shaped structure along with substrate&#8208;catalyst binding is crucial for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity. The water molecules are held together by H&#8208;bonding interactions with the carboxylate ligands that is reminiscent of enzyme catalysis. Till date there is no transition state model that can explain the high enantioselectivity with such chiral Rh complexes. The metal&#8208;associated enol pathway is currently underrepresented in catalytic cycles and may play a crucial role in catalyst design. Since the enol pathway is commonly adopted in other metal&#8208;catalyzed X&#8211;H insertion reactions involving a diazoester, our results are not specific to the current reaction. Therefore, our study could provide the direction for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity which is otherwise difficult to achieve with a single metal catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Hydrolysis of Imidazolinium Chlorides (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors) Under Basic Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experi&#173;mental parameters were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of&#160;&#947;&#8208;amino&#173;formamides starting from twelve symme&#173;trical substrates with alkyl or aryl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and five unsym&#173;metrical 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#173;imidazol&#173;in&#173;ium chlorides. NMR and XRD analyses showed that the cleavage of unsymmetrical salts led to&#160;&#947;&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#173;formamides with a high regio&#173;selec&#173;ti&#173;vity and that bulky alkyl or aryl groups on the formamide moiety led to the isolation of the (E)&#8208;isomer in high stereoisomeric purity (&gt;95%), whereas smaller and more flexible alkyl substituents afforded mixtures of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;rotamers. Control experiments showed that the hydrolysis of 1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#173;imidazolinium chloride (SIMes&#183;HCl) did not occur readily in pure or acidic water and that the presence of bulky aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms of 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#173;imidazol&#173;inium chloride (SIDip&#183;HCl) efficiently slowed down its hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Most strikingly, this work highlighted the critical influence of the counteranion on the reactivity of imidazolinium cations. Indeed, the chloride salts underwent a facile hydrolysis in the presence of water and Na2CO3, whereas various other NHC&#183;HX derivatives reacted much slower or remained essentially inert under these conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Oxidative Addition Routes of Alkali Metal Aluminyls to Dihydridoaluminates and Reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct methods have been studied to convert alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)] (AM=Li&#8722;Cs) to dihydridoaluminates AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2], which in turn reduce CO2 to bis&#8208;formates AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2]. Diverting from its usual proton&#8208;hydride releasing behaviour, 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene undergoes a remarkable oxidative addition in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric reaction with Cs[Al(NONDipp)] yielding the inverse sandwich compound [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)] (pictured).







Abstract
Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM=Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM=Li&#8722;Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8722; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8722;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes were hydration under bench type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents) thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium. This Fe&#8208;DES was recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent.

An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones has been developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/Gly (3&#8201;:&#8201;1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i)&#8197;under mild (45&#8201;&#176;C) and bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (air); and ii)&#8197;in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30&#8197;min, and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated by simply decanting the liquid FeIII&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle the FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to eight consecutive times. Furthermore, the FeIII&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the possibility of recycling this system up to three consecutive times. Preliminary investigations into a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seem to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones.

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico designed N&#8208;modified tripeptide PEP1 (yellow) imitating TIN2 peptide (green) can modulate interaction of TIN2 with TRF1 telomeric shelterin protein (gray) as shown in the figure and in consequence cause biological effects in cancer cells leading to senescence.







Abstract
In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed &#8220;peptidomimetic&#8221; molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in&#8197;vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.

         <title>Formation of a Hexaphosphido Cobalt Complex through P&#8722;P Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[4+2] condensation reaction of diphosphene [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf and diphosphanide [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] with the cyclo&#8208;P4 cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] forms a CoP6 complex, featuring an unusual hexaphosphido ligand composed of a cyclo&#8208;P5 ring and an exocyclic (ClImDipp)P moiety. 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that at ambient temperature, this CoP6 complex undergoes disproportionation into more stable CoP7 and CoP5 complexes.







Abstract
The reaction between diphosphorus derivatives [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf (1[OTf]) and [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] (1[Cl]) with the cyclotetraphosphido cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] (2) leads to the formation of complex [(PHDI)Co{&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P6(Dipp)(ClImDipp)}] (3), which features an unusual hexaphosphido ligand [ClImDipp=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, 18c&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, PHDI=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diimine]. Complex 3 was obtained as a crystalline material with a moderate yield at low temperature. Upon exposure to ambient temperature, compound 3 slowly transforms into two other compounds, [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P7Dipp)] (4) and [(PHDI)Co{cyclo&#8208;P5(ClImDipp)}] (5). The novel complexes 3&#8211;5 were characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. To shed light on the formation of these compounds, a proposed mechanism based on 31P&#8197;NMR monitoring studies is presented.

         <title>Synergistic Promotion of Large&#8208;Current Water Splitting through Interfacial Engineering of Hierarchically Structured CoP&#8722;FeP Nanosheets with Rich P Vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam is constructed through impregnation and phosphorization. It demonstrates excellent hydrogen evolution performance and has practical application prospects in high&#8208;current overall water splitting. The catalyst&#8216;s unique hierarchical nanosheet structure, plentiful P vacancies and synergistic effect of CoP and FeP accelerate HER kinetics, resulting in its superior performance.







Abstract
The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. This study investigates a CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and displaying robust durability (50&#8197;h @ 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76&#8197;V at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst&#8216;s outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. This study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Hybrid Prodrug for the Self&#8208;Immolative Delivery of an Anticancer Agent and Hydrogen Sulfide with Turn&#8208;on Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorogenic prodrugs are advantageous for the targeted drug delivery enabling real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive monitoring with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. We report herein the dual&#8208;stimuli (ROS and CA)&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based prodrug (AM&#8208;TCB) for the turn&#8208;on fluorogenic delivery of the naphthalimide&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide along with the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). A carbamate&#8208;based prodrug AM&#8208;CB was also designed, capable of releasing the anticancer agent amonafide without any H2S. The prodrugs were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis. UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic studies revealed selective reactivity of the boronate ester group of prodrugs towards ROS (primarily H2O2) with the release of amonafide and COS/CO2 via self&#8208;immolative processes. Hydrolysis of the generated COS by carbonic anhydrase (CA) produces H2S. While the prodrug AM&#8208;TCB retained the anticancer activity of free amonafide in cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HeLa), unlike amonafide, it enhanced the cellular viability of the non&#8208;malignant cells (HEK&#8208;293). Fluorescence imaging in HeLa cells revealed the simultaneous delivery of the anticancer agent and H2S from AM&#8208;TCB with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Western blot studies further revealed the cytoprotective effects of the released H2S from AM&#8208;TCB. The present adjuvant strategy therefore would be helpful in future for ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.</dc:description>

         <title>The Calculation of Both Electrostatic and Van der Waals Effects to Probe the Efficiency of Solvent Extraction of Heterocyclic Aromatics from Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the complex composition and similar structure, the extraction denitrification of aromatic rich oil is faced with the contradiction problem of denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss which cannot be efficiently solved by experiments. However, the complex interactions involved can be analyzed from the perspective of calculation, and the prediction criteria and methods are proposed. Based on rigorous density functional theory calculation data, we have established and validated simple models based on electrostatic potential (ESP) and Van der Waals potential (VdWP)&#8208;based calculations. The twofold model provided the best prediction for interactions between extractants and nitrogen compounds and between extractants and aromatics, which determines denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss, respectively, due to the most complete description of both electrostatic and VdW force. This provides a powerful tool for evaluating the non&#8208;covalent interactions and thence tuning the efficiency of the separation process. Thus, high denitrification efficiency (43.2~66.3%) and moderate aromatic loss (1.7~4.4%) were obtained using screened deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This ideal observation provided the potential for mild hydrodesulfurization and manufacture of high&#8208;grade carbon materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Chlorosilanes into Hydrosilanes with &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenging metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl chlorides to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using an inverse frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), combining a mild Lewis acid (Cy2BCl) and a strong phosphazene base (BTPP) in mild conditions (10&#160;bar of H2, r.t.). In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of the base, the hydrosilanes R3SiH (R&#160;=&#160;Me, Et, Ph) are generated in moderate to high yields (up to 95%) from their chlorinated counterparts. A selective formation of the valuable difunctional monohydride Me2SiHCl is also obtained from Me2SiCl2. A mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations; it highlights the critical role of borohydride species generated by the heterolytic splitting of H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Crystallization of Calcium Phosphates by Light&#8208;Induced Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medical treatment options for bones and teeth can be significantly enhanced by taking control over the crystallization of biomaterials like hydroxyapatite in the healing process. Light&#8208;induced techniques are particularly interesting for this approach as they offer tremendous accuracy in spatial resolution. However, in the field of calcium phosphates, light&#8208;induced crystallization has not been investigated so far. Here, we establish a proof of principle to successfully induce carbonate&#8208;hydroxyapatite precipitation by light irradiation. Phosphoric acid is released by a photolabile molecule exclusively after irradiation, combining with calcium ions to form a calcium phosphate in the crystallization medium. 4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate (4NPP) is established as the photolabile molecule and the system is optimized and fully characterized. We successfully crystallize a calcium phosphate by irradiation in aqueous solution and identify it as carbonate apatite. Control over the localization and stabilization of the carbonate apatite is achieved by a pulsed laser, triggering precipitation in calcium and 4NPP&#8208;containing gel matrices. We anticipate that the results of this communication will open up a wide range of new opportunities; both, in the field of chemistry for more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes, as well as in the field of medicine for enhanced treatment of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions involves the application of organozinc reagents and is a highly versatile reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. The transmetallation step plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of these types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Herein, we present our mechanistic investigations, indicating, that higher&#8208;order zincates are the transmetallating active species in Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings are supported by halide salt addition experiments and by obtaining a single X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincate&#160;[1&#8208;NaphthylZnX3]2&#8211;Mg(THF)22+. The procedure developed in this work was further applied to the synthesis of various monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates, after which their synthetic usefulness in terms of high reactivity towards transmetallation in Negishi cross&#8208;couplings, as well as stability, was exemplified in several reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Organosulfur Compounds to Alkynes and Alkenes: Catalysis and Catalyst Poisons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of heteroatom compounds to alkynes and alkenes is an atom&#8208;efficient method of carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond formation and is widely used as a fundamental synthetic method for the construction of functional molecules. Nevertheless, examples of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition reactions of group 16 heteroatom compounds to carbon&#8211;carbon unsaturated bonds have been limited due to the widespread belief that organic sulfur and selenium compounds are representative catalyst poisons. In recent decades, however, several seminal catalytic reactions of sulfur compounds have been developed, providing important insights into catalysis and poisons. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes, gain comprehensive insights into the catalysis and catalyst poisons, and propose concepts for the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of group 16 heteroatom compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfone/Carbonyl&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorescent Dyes: Synthesis, Structures, Photophysical Properties and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;accepting units play vital roles in constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated organic optoelectronic materials, the electronic structures and functions of the acceptors are needed to carefully unveil to controllably tailor the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we synthesized two D&#8208;A conjugated organic fluorophores (named TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO) with similar molecular skeletons based on sulfone or carbonyl contained polycyclic aromatic acceptors. For strong intramolecular charge transfer processes, both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO display obvious solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties and large Stokes shift of over 100 nm. The experimental evidences indicate sulfone group in TPA&#8208;SO merely serves as a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, and TPA&#8208;SO shows yellowish&#8208;green emission with an emission peak at 542 nm and absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98% in solution, while the carbonyl group in TPA&#8208;CO can act as both electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and spin transition convertor, so TPA&#8208;CO displays red emission with a low absolute PLQY of 0.32% in solution. Impressively, from solution to aggregate state, TPA&#8208;SO nanoparticles keep high PLQY of 9.5% and good biocompatibility, which are good nanoprobes for cellular fluorescence imaging. The results reveal that the inherent characteristic of acceptors acts as a crucial effect in the photophysical properties and applications of the organic fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Improvement in Edge Roughness of Supramolecular Nanosheets by Using a Dummy Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are formed through nucleation (i.e., initiation) and polymerization processes, and kinetic control over the nucleation process has recently led to the realization of living supramolecular polymerization. Changing the viewpoint, herein we focus on controlling the polymerization process, which we expect to pave the way to further developments in controlled supramolecular polymerization. In our previous study, two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization was used to produce supramolecular nanosheets with a controlled area; however, these had rough edges. In this study, the growth of the nanosheets was controlled by using a &#8216;dummy&#8217; monomer to produce supramolecular nanosheets with smoothed edges.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phenothiazinone as Fluorophore and its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenothiazinone is a promising yet underutilized fluorophore, possibly due to the lack of a general accessibility. Herein, we report a robust and scalable TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrochemical method to access a variety of phenothiazinones from 2&#8208;aminothiophenols and quinones. The electrosynthesis proceeds in a simple cell architecture under mild condition, and notably carbon&#8211;halogen bond in quinones remains compared to conventional methods, enabling orthogonal downstream functionalization. Mechanistic studies corroborate that TEMPO exert a protective effect in avoiding product decomposition at the cathode. In particular, benzophenothiazinones show intriguing luminescence in the states of both solid and solution, and thus their photophysical properties are scrutinized in detail. Further bio&#8208;imaging of the lipid droplets in living cells highlights the considerable promise of benzophenothiazinones as fluorescent dye in the biomedical fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Molecular Clips To Build &#960;&#8208;Stacks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature utilizes an intimate stacking of aromatic motifs to construct functional structures, as demonstrated in protein folding and polynucleotide assembly. However, organized &#960;&#8208;stacks of artificial molecules are difficult to build, primarily due to the weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive nature of van der Waals forces. To overcome these challenges, chemists have invented ingenious architectural designs to construct &#960;&#8208;stacked supramolecular assemblies using clip&#8208;like molecules. This CONCEPT article focuses on molecular clips that offer precise spatial control over assembly patterns, beyond the scope of simple host&#8211;guest chemistry. We analyze and compare different design strategies that leverage non&#8208;covalent interactions to create multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacks. Particular emphasis is placed on the choice of spine units as they play a crucial role in controlling the (i) spacing, (ii) orientation, and (iii) conformational pre&#8208;organization of linked aromatics to achieve long&#8208;range spatial ordering.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiocontrol via Electronics: Insights into a Ru&#8208;Catalyzed, Cu&#8208;Mediated Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Isoquinolones via a C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8208;catalyzed, Cu&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective, C3/C4&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved. The reaction pathway is characterized by open&#8208;shell singlet and triplet energy pathways arising from the bimetallic complex. Regioselectivity arises from the energies of the two states. While the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily afford the unprecedented C(4)&#8208;isomer, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups show an inclination towards the C(3)&#8208;product.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/Cu(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, whereas the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8208;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet pathways for the C(3)&#8208; and C(4)&#8208;product formation. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.

3&#8208;Benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones are of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry. These compounds have been extensively reported for their biological properties, but have hardly been studied concerning their photochemical activity. Here, we present 3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones as a promising class of photoswitches with high yields, robust photochemical switching, and quantum yields reaching up to 50&#8201;%.

3&#8208;Benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones play a prominent role in the pharmaceutical industry due to the diverse biomedical applications of oxindole heterocycles.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel route using Schreiner thiourea mediated organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with diverse azides is devised to furnish high yield of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl glycoconjugates. The method has some notable features including metal&#8208;free, straightforward, acid&#8208;free, excellent regioselectivity operationally simple, wide substrate scope and high yielding. The Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea organocatalyst, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of diverse 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields with excellent regioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel route using Schreiner&lt;/b&gt; thiourea mediated organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with diverse azides is devised to furnish high yield of 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazolyl glycoconjugates. The method has some notable features including metal-free, straightforward, acid-free, excellent regioselectivity operationally simple, wide substrate scope and high yielding. The Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Metathesis for the Synthesis of Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis is a type of carbon&#8208;carbon forming reaction involving the construction a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a carbonyl group in one transformation. Herein, a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis protocol has been developed to make densely substituted &#947;&#8208;butenolides from propargyl &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. It features 100% atom economy, excellent substrate flexibility and benign functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the coordinative interaction between the gold catalyst and the alkyne might initiate the transfer of an oxygen atom and the formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. By using this gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis as a key step reaction, four naturally occurring butenolide&#8208;type compounds including decumbic acid (45% yield for 3 steps), deoxyisosporothric acid (32% yield for 5 steps), lichesterinic acid (34% yield for 5 steps) and isomuronic acid (6% yield for 8 steps) have been accessed starting from commercially available starting materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Gas separation: A novel organic cage with excellent film&#8208;forming tendencies was processed into transparent, mechanically robust, self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to their peculiar features, the membranes of the neat cage were successfully tested for gas permeation (e.g., with CO2), with behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides being reported.

         <title>In silico investigation of the thermochemistry and photoactivity of pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution of NaCl</title>

         <dc:description>
Ab&#8197;initio study of the hydrated and non&#8208;hydrated forms of pyruvate in NaCl aqueous solution emphasizes the influence of sodium on the chemical equilibrium of hydration and photoactivity of the anion.







Abstract
The photochemistry of oxocarboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions, influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab&#8197;initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2&#8197;kJ/mol at 300&#8197;K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+ coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.

Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.

         <title>Unravelling the Mystery of COVID&#8208;19 Pathogenesis: Spike Protein and Cu Can Synergize to Trigger ROS Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How COVID&#8208;19 damage DNA: Severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules in COVID&#8208;19&#8208;infected lungs has been reported. Our study shows that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein fragments coordinate Cu(II) ions, forming three&#8208;nitrogen complexes in the lung environment. Using various methods, we demonstrated that these complexes generate ROS, leading to single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand DNA breaks.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549&#8197;cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinidene Oxide, Imide and Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidene conducts an auction for the best P=X bond: Cyclic phosphinoamidinate&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P is a natural precursor to base&#8208;stabilized PIII compounds (NP)P=X (X=O, NR, S). Interestingly, for the stronger P=O and P=N bonds, the respective compounds (NP)P=O and (NP)P=NTol are labile and cannot be isolated, but can be intercepted by isocyanate TolNCO to give the urea compound (NP)P&#8208;(NTol)2CO. In contrast, the sulfide (NP)P=S, prepared by a reaction of (NP)P with sulfur, is isolable. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;F. Vyboishchikov, G.&#8197;I. Nikonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301842).

         <title>EPR Sensing of a Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the use of aza&#8208;crown ethers containing a stable nitroxide acting as selective sensor of inorganic and organic cations is described. The radical is deeply involved in the coordination complex generating peculiar EPR spectral pattern also depending on non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of the metal cation. The wheel was employed also in the preparation of a rotaxane structure.







Abstract
New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8211;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to the non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8901; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust sensor: A robust methodology for the fabrication of electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor biosensors is presented. Single walled carbon nanotubes are hybridized with bovine serum albumin allowing the transistor fabrication from aqueous solution. The sensor functionality is demonstrated for the detection of cortisol in solution after immobilization of antibodies on the gate surface. Analysis of the signal allows the extraction of binding parameters.







Abstract
Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts Are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicationic diiminium pyridine adducts distinctively concentrate their positive charges at the diiminium carbon atom, a characteristic vividly portrayed in their molecular electrostatic potential. They are easily handled and synthesized. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302089), F.&#8197;F. Mulks and co&#8208;workers showcase the adducts&#8217; prominence as potent Lewis acids, particularly in facilitating dehydration reactions like amide and imide couplings. Artwork: F.F.M., &#8220;FM009&#8221;, digital and acrylic on paper.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified&#8208;GO and GO&#8208;dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8208;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to GO were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non&#8208;cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>The Challenging World of Simple Inorganic Rings: Revisiting Roesky&#8217;s Ketone and Roesky&#8217;s Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surprising differences between the experimental solid&#8208;state and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiazole (Roesky&#8217;s ketone, 1) and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,3,5&#8208;trithiadiazole (Roesky&#8217;s sulfoxide, 2), identified and studied in a series of papers published between 2004 and 2010 but then never satisfactorily explained, have been revisited, making use of the more advanced computational possibilities currently available. The previous calculations&#8217; considerable overestimations of the C&#8211;S and S&#8211;S bond lengths in 1 and 2, respectively, have been partly explained based on the results of periodic calculations and the application of Valence Bond (VB) Theory. In the case of 1, the crystal environment appears to stabilize a structure with a highly polarized C=O bond, which features a C&#8211;S bond with considerable double&#8208;bond character &#8211; an effect which does not exist for the isolated molecule &#8211; explaining the much shorter bond in the solid state. For 2, a similar conclusion can be drawn for the S&#8211;S distance. For both compounds, though, packing effects are not the sole source of the differences: the inability of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to properly deal with the electronic structures of these apparently simple main&#8208;group systems remains a contributing factor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Coating the Separator with a Cation&#8208;Selective Polymer Layer&#160;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are believed to possess the feasibility to power electric vehicles in the future ascribed to the competitive energy density. However, soluble polysulfides continuously shuttle between the sulfur electrode and lithium anode across the separator, which dramatically impairs the battery&#8217;s capacity. Herein, the surface of a polypropylene separator (PP film) is successfully modified with a delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer layer to suppress the transport of polysulfides. In principle, since bis&#8208;sulfonimide anions groups on the backbone of the polymer are immobilized, only cations can pass through the polymer layer. Furthermore, plenty of ethoxy chains in the polymer can facilitate lithium&#8208;ion mobility. Consequently, in addition to obstructing the movement of negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsive force of fixed anions, the coated multi&#8208;functional layer on the PP film also guarantees the smooth conduction of lithium ions. The investigations demonstrate that the battery with the pristine PP film only delivers 228.5 mAh g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles at 2 C with a high capacity fading rate of 60.9%. By contrast, the polymer&#8208;coated sample can release 409.4 mAh g&#8208;1 under the identical test condition and the capacity fading rate sharply declines to 43.2%, illustrating superior cycle performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] bismolyl Bitet (C4Me4Bi) contact ion pair 1 is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bitet anion of 1 features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the Bi(I) center, and delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated C4Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)22. The latter results from salt metathesis reaction of KBitet with Cptet2Y(BPh4) (Cptet = C5Me4H). The Y&#8211;Bi bonding interaction in 2 of 16.6% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Truncation on Optoelectronic Properties of Azaborole Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report configurationally stable singly&#8208;truncated (ST) and structurally flexible doubly&#8208;truncated (DT) helically chiral compounds derived from azabora[7]helicenes by a hypothetical removal of a single or two C=C double bonds. The singly&#8208;truncated constitutional isomers were synthesized from either benzoisoquinoline (BIQ) or phenantherene building blocks and the corresponding biaryls in excellent yields to give azabora[5]helicenes with a pendant phenyl ring at a sterically hindered position. These systems highlight the electronic impact of the nitrogen donor substitution position. The compounds with a disrupted BIQ moiety (STN) possess remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and a blue emission in solution with dissymmetry factors of up to ca. 3 &#215; 10&#8211;3. Upon cooling to 79 K all compounds exhibit phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ca. 0.5 s. A methyl complex of azabora[7]helicene showing excellent configurational stability was used as a chiral inducer embedded in an emissive polymer (F8BT) to produce circularly polarized organic light emitting diodes with an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor gEL of up to 0.54.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP = N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776; 4 bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5a, R = Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5b, R = Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that 5a/H2 as well as 6a enable the photo&#8208;induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Increasing the Air&#8208;stability of Phosphines Including Primary Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given recent reports of structurally diverse air&#8208;stable primary phosphines lacking kinetic stabilization, the stability against oxidation was difficult to rationalize and attributed to the specific electronic nature of the phosphine group. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n = 0,1,2,3; and Fc = ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. The collected information suggests that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect which was experimentally confirmed using other established singlet oxygen quenchers as well, demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of N,N&#8208;difunctionalized anilines into formamides derivatives (up to 89&#8201;% yield) under mild operative conditions is described herein. In this reaction, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) acts as a robust and fully recyclable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst that was easily recovered and reused up to five times without any significant drop in yield.







Abstract
The use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches, is reported herein. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as an oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption, which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2 via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Dimer of an Alcohol with the Derived Carboxylic acid Triggering their Sorption by Nanoporous&#8208;crystalline PPO Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO) films do not absorb benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA) separately from dilute aqueous solutions while exhibiting selective uptake of a BAL/BA equimolar compound, if BA is obtained by oxidizing BAL. Quantitative FTIR evaluations and structural information indicate uptake of a BAL/BA hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer in PPO intrahelical crystalline channels.







Abstract
Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c&#8869; orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces. High and fast sorption of a hydrogen bonded dimer and negligible sorption of the two separate compounds is possibly unprecedented for absorbent materials.

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). &#160;However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#1060;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8208;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new isoorotamide (Io) containing PNA nucleobases were designed for A&#8208;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA 9&#8208;mers for binding A&#8208;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly&#8208;modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen&#8208;hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyc Hydrodecarboxylation of Fatty Acids for Drop&#8208;In Biofuels Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild, practical, and environmentally friendly method for the hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using an acridine&#8208;based photoredox catalyst and thiophenol was developed. Cn&#8208;1 alkanes were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 99%) from C9&#8208;C18 saturated fatty acids under visible light irradiation (405 nm). The developed protocol was employed for a mixture of fatty acids obtained from the hydrolysis of Licuri oil, affording a mixture of C9&#8208;C17 hydrocarbons in quantitative yield, which demonstrates the potential application of the method to produce drop&#8208;in biofuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Assisted Arylation of Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of Lewis bases with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls allows the in situ generation of enolates without the need for strong Br&#248;nsted bases. Recently developed synthetic methods employ this approach for arylation followed by elimination of the Lewis base, regenerating the alkene. This strategy has been deployed for formal &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H arylation in different contexts, namely (a) transition metal catalysis, (b) rearrangement reactions utilizing hypervalent main group elements and (c) organocatalysis. This concept article provides an overview of the developed strategies highlighting and contextualizing their features.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring&#8208;sizes of meta&#8208; or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate&#8208;analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring&#8208;contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P4O112&#8722;, was selectively obtained and then ring&#8208;opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.</dc:description>
