         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal transience. A highly adaptive coacervate is reported that can be formed transiently under the influence of two different triggers, pH and redox. The cumulative effect of both triggers results in the coacervation and the transient cycles can be operated sequentially for multiple cycles.







Abstract
An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea&#8208;urease/gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the above&#8208;mentioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for protein/drug delivery purposes in the future.

         <title>Conjugating Coumarin with Tetraphenylethylene to Achieve Dual&#8208;State Emission for Reversible Mechanofluorochromism and Live Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived dual&#8208;state luminogens (DSEgens) with bright emission in both dilute solutions and the solid state have been synthesized by finely tuning electronic structures and molecular conformations. Experimental results suggest that a favorable electron transfer within the highly twisting molecules is essential for the DSE properties. The DSEgens were demonstrated applicable as dual&#8208;state probes for reversible mechanofluorochromism and live cell imaging.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission luminogens (DSEgens) are receiving research interest in the construction of multifunctional materials due to their inherent advantage of high emission efficiency in both the molecularly dispersed solution state and the solid state. However, it remains challenging in synthesizing DSEgens via a delicate manipulation of the molecular structures. This work presents an example of bright DSEgen synthesis by tuning the molecular electronic structures and conformations. Three coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecules with a donor&#8208;acceptor electronic structure and highly twisting conformations have been synthesized. While compound resulting from direct conjugation of coumarin with a TPE unit shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission, compound with an N,N&#8208;diaminoethyl modification on the 7&#8208;position of coumarin and compound with a further phenyl linker between coumarin and TPE units feature strong dual&#8208;state emission. Benefiting from their strong solid emission and twisting conformations, these fluorophores display reversible mechanofluorochromism. Finally, applications for rewritable information storage in the solid state and live&#8208;cell imaging in the solution state were demonstrated.

         <title>Functionalized MOF&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent improved strategies on the pure MOF and various MOF&#8208;based composites photocatalysts are summarized here. An insight into the absorption edges is proposed, CO2 adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activities of these newly developed photocatalysts are highlighted to provide fundamental guidance to rational design of efficient MOF&#8208;based photocatalyst materials for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have become a research forefront in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction attributed to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, adjustable structure, and abundant catalytic active sites. Particularly, MOFs can be facilely tuned to match CO2 photoreduction by utilizing post&#8208;modification of metal nodes, functionalization of organic linkers, and combination with other active materials. Herein, the recent advances in the construction strategy of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts materials for CO2 reduction are highlighted. Some systematic modification strategies on MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts are also discussed, such as modification of metal sites and organic ligands, construction of heterojunction, introduction of single/dual&#8208;atom, and strain engineering. Finally, the future development directions of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts in the field of CO2 reduction are presented.

Nanopalladium on cellulose catalyzes hydroborations: A highly efficient and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydroboration reaction. The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and recyclability, providing vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90&#8201;%).







Abstract
A highly efficient regio&#8208; and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydroboration reaction. The nanopalladium particles were shown by HAADF&#8208;STEM to have an average size of 2.4&#8197;nm. The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and provides vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90&#8201;%). The nanopalladium catalyst can be efficiently recycled and it was demonstrated that the catalyst can be used in 7 runs with a maintained high yield (&gt;80&#8201;%). The vinylboron compounds prepared from enallenes are important synthetic intermediates that can be used in various organic synthetic transformations.

         <title>Theoretical Calculations on Metal Catalysts Toward Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction: a Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in theoretical calculations (structural characteristics, reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics) of metal catalysts toward water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction are summarized and highlighted in this review with special emphasis on the properties of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy and metal&#8208;support interaction.







Abstract
Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction offers a dominating path to hydrogen generation from fossil fuel, in which heterogeneous metal catalysts play a crucial part in this course. This review highlights and summarizes recent developments on theoretical calculations of metal catalysts developed to date, including surface structure (e.&#8201;g., monometallic and polymetallic systems) and interface structure (e.&#8201;g., supported catalysts and metal oxide composites), with special emphasis on the characteristics of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy, and metal&#8208;support interaction. A systematic summarization on reaction mechanism was performed, including redox mechanism, associative mechanism as well as hybrid mechanism; the development on chemical kinetics (e.&#8201;g., molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic simulation) was then introduced. At the end, challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction are discussed and some perspectives on the future advance of this field are provided.

At the end, challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction are discussed and some perspectives on the future advance of this field are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evaluation by Experimentation and Simulation of a FRET Pair Comprising Fluorescent Nucleobase Analogs in Nucleosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Minimal modification and orientation dependency: Nucleobase FRET pair was incorporated into nucleosome and its ability was examined by experimentation and simulation. Experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies showed similar trends suggesting orientation dependency of the FRET pair.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an attractive tool for understanding biomolecular dynamics. FRET&#8208;based analysis of nucleosomes has the potential to fill the knowledge gaps between static structures and dynamic cellular behaviors. Compared with typical FRET pairs using bulky fluorophores introduced by flexible linkers, fluorescent nucleoside&#8208;based FRET pair has great potential since it can be fitted within the helical structures of nucleic acids. Herein we report on the construction of nucleosomes containing a nucleobase FRET pair and the investigation of experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies through steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy and calculation based on molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. Distinguishable experimental FRET efficiencies were observed depending on the positions of FRET pairs in nucleosomal DNA. The tendency could be supported by theoretical study. This work suggests the possibility of our approach to analyze structural changes of nucleosomes by epigenetic modifications or internucleosomal interactions.

Abstract
Skeletal editing via single&#8208;atom insertion reactions involving nitrogen heterocycles have been reported by two innovative and complementary methods for the conversion of pyrroles and indoles to pyridines, quinolines and quinazolines. The use of electrophilic carbonyl cation equivalents and in&#8197;situ generated nitrenes enables molecular editing to transform heterocycles forming the foundation of best&#8208;selling pharmaceuticals. Considering the importance of heterocycles in medicinal chemistry, biology and natural products, these methods offer innovative approach to complex molecular structures by heterocycle diversification and peripheral editing.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution of CrOx/Rh Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) was investigated as a model cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. A 2&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ultrathin CrOx layer on RhNP (CrOx/RhNP) significantly improves HER activity. DC and AC electrochemical measurements revealed that a CrOx/RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process on HER, and H+ reaches the RhNP surface via the H+&#8208;hopping process inside the CrOx layer.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) coated with an ultrathin layer of Cr&#8208;oxides (CrOx) was investigated as a model electrode for the Cr2O3/Rh&#8208;metal core&#8208;shell&#8208;type cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. The CrOx layer was electrodeposited over RhNP on a transparent conductive fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The CrOx layer on RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process at the CrOx/RhNP interface, leading to the increased current density for the HER. Impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CrOx layer transferred protons via the hopping mechanism to the RhNP surface for HER. In addition, CrOx restricted electron transfer from the FTO to the electrolyte and/or RhNP and suppressed the backward reaction by limiting oxygen migration. This study clarifies the crucial role of the ultrathin CrOx layer on nanoparticulate cocatalysts and provides a cocatalyst design strategy for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Zwitterionic Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the significance of the charged biomacromolecule incorporation for mineralization control, gel&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from different gelatin hydrogels are examined. The charged groups on gel networks play crucial roles in controlling the single&#8208;crystallinity and the crystal morphology. The gel&#8208;incorporation greatly enhances the charge effects because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to the crystallization fronts.







Abstract
The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge concentrations along the gel networks are examined. It is found that the bound charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, gelatin&#8208;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, gelatin&#8208;COO&#8722;) play crucial roles in controlling the single&#8208;crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the incorporated gel networks force the bound charged groups on them to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8722;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because the balance of attachment/detachment make them more difficult to be incorporated. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and efficient electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol is developed for the direct conversion of readily available aliphatic carboxylic acids into chiral alkyl nitriles. Electrophotochemical Ce catalysis enables mild reaction conditions for radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical Cu catalysis for the construction of C&#8722;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective manner.







Abstract
In contrast to the rapid growth of electrophotocatalysis in recent years, enantioselective catalytic reactions powered by this unique methodology remain rare. In this work, we report an electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for direct asymmetric decarboxylative cyanation of aliphatic carboxylic acids. The synergistic merging of electrophotochemical cerium catalysis and asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis permits mild reaction conditions for the formation and utilization of the key carbon centered radicals by combining the power of light and electrical energy. Electrophotochemical cerium catalysis enables radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis for the construction of C&#8722;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective fashion. This environmentally benign method smoothly converts a diverse array of arylacetic acids into the corresponding alkyl nitriles in good yields and enantioselectivities without using chemical oxidants or pre&#8208;functionalization of the acid substrates and can be readily scaled up.

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First check your solvent: In a dinuclear dimethylglyoxime copper(II) complex, hydrolysis of one ligand is facilitated by the cooperative effect of both CuII ions. Hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH; depending on the solvent used, the latter is either oxidized to N2O (in CH3CN) or reduced to NH4+ (in ethanol). A combined approach of experimental, theoretical, and spectroscopic methods allowed the reaction mechanism to be suggested.







Abstract
In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1), which, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increases the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that, depending on the solvent, is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as the oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.

         <title>The Full Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine Base Paring: Self&#8208;Assembly and Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual multiple cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring pattern (named full C&#8201;:&#8201;C base pairing) and i&#8208;motif structure in self assembly complexes induced by the regulation of solvent condition and pH values.







Abstract
The synthesis of self&#8208;assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed self&#8208;assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring pattern (named full C&#8201;:&#8201;C base pairing) has been successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid&#8208;state combined with crystal structure analysis.

         <title>A Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Photo&#8208;Electrode to Promote NH3 Yield in Sustainable N2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to address current NH3 yield challenge of NRR by achieving low H* coverages at appreciable current densities based on the unique SPR effect and established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance. The specifically designed ZnSe(Au) electrode achieves a high FE and NH3 yield rate of 27.3&#8201;% and 12.2&#8197;&#956;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
A key challenge for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) is the difficulty for conventional catalysts to achieve high currents at low H* coverage to produce appreciable NH3. Herein, we specially designed an Au nanoparticle&#8208;embedded ZnSe photo&#8208;electrode to solve the problem. As&#8208;designed photo&#8208;electrode achieves excellent NRR performance with a high NH3 yield (12.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (27.3&#8201;%). Our work reveals that the unique plasmon resonance effect of embedded Au nanoparticles plays a key role in increasing catalytic current when the H* coverage is decreased. Moreover, we successfully established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance based on theoretical calculations and experimental observations. This work paves the path for the future design of catalytic materials to overcome the selectivity and yield challenge of sustainable NH3 production.

         <title>The Role of the Transient Atropisomerism and Chirality of Flurbiprofen Unveiled by Laser&#8208;Ablation Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two most stable conformers of flurbiprofen (FB) have been isolated. They only differ in the dihedral angle that defines the arrangement of the phenyl group revealing FB atropisomerism. Analysing the recognition of FB by COX isoforms, it comes out that only one of these atropisomers is specifically selected for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; enantiomer.







Abstract
The combination of atropisomerism and chirality in flurbiprofen is shown to be relevant concerning its pharmacological activity. The two most stable conformers of a total of eight theoretically predicted for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; flurbiprofen enantiomers have been isolated in the cooling conditions of a supersonic jet and structurally characterized by laser ablation Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The detected conformers, whose structure is mainly defined by three dihedral angles, only differ in the sign of the phenyl torsion angle giving rise to Sa and Ra atropisomers. A comparison with the structures available for the R&#8208; and S&#8208; enantiomers complexed to COX isoforms reveals that the enzymes select only the Sa atropisomers, resulting in a diastereoisomer&#8208;specific recognition. The most stable gas phase conformer is exclusively selected when using the S&#8208; enantiomer while the second is recognized only for the R&#8208; enantiomer. These experimental results highlight the importance of atropisomerism in drug design.

         <title>Secondary Orbital Effect Involving Fluorine is Responsible for Substrate&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergence in the Catalyzed syn&#8208;aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitroalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence for a secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;activated azomethine (C=N) is found to be a driving force for fluorine&#8208;induced diastereodivergence observed in a rare syn&#8208;selective aza&#8208;Henry reaction. This study examines BAM catalysis in detail, but the phenomenon is expected to be more general given similar observations in enantioselective phase transfer catalysis.







Abstract
The fluorine atom is a powerful, yet enigmatic influence on chemical reactions. True to form, fluorine was recently discovered to effect diastereodivergence in an enantioselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction, resulting in a very rare case of syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane products. More bewildering was the observation of an apparent hierarchy of substituents within this substrate&#8208;controlled behavior: Ph&gt;F&gt;alkyl. These cases have now been examined comprehensively by computational methods, including both non&#8208;fluorinated and &#945;&#8208;fluoro nitronate additions to aldimines catalyzed by a chiral bis(amidine) [BAM] proton complex. This study revealed the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions that dictate anti&#8208; (&#945;&#8208;aryl) versus syn&#8208;selectivity (&#945;&#8208;alkyl) using &#945;&#8208;fluoronitronate nucleophiles, and an underlying secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and the activated azomethine.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evidence for a secondary orbital interaction&lt;/b&gt; between fluorine and a hydrogen-bond-activated azomethine (C=N) is found to be a driving force for fluorine-induced diastereodivergence observed in a rare &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-selective aza-Henry reaction. This study examines BAM catalysis in detail, but the phenomenon is expected to be more general given similar observations in enantioselective phase transfer catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluorine atom is a powerful, yet enigmatic influence on chemical reactions. True to form, fluorine was recently discovered to effect diastereodivergence in an enantioselective aza-Henry reaction, resulting in a very rare case of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-amino nitroalkane products. More bewildering was the observation of an apparent hierarchy of substituents within this substrate-controlled behavior: Ph&amp;gt;F&amp;gt;alkyl. These cases have now been examined comprehensively by computational methods, including both non-fluorinated and &#945;-fluoro nitronate additions to aldimines catalyzed by a chiral bis(amidine) [BAM] proton complex. This study revealed the network of non-covalent interactions that dictate &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;- (&#945;-aryl) versus &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity (&#945;-alkyl) using &#945;-fluoronitronate nucleophiles, and an underlying secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and the activated azomethine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defects&#8208;Abundant Ga2O3 Nanobricks Enabled Multifunctional Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3 nanobricks were applied as multifunctional fillers to construct a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the multifunctional feature of Ga2O3 filler, this composite electrolyte not only broadens the electrochemical stability window but also improved the ionic conductivity and thereby attaining a superior rate capability.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the low ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rationally designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3 nanobricks as multifunctional fillers and constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects feature of Ga2O3 filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window (over 5.3&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) but also in&#8197;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte has good interface compatibility with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained an excellent cycling performance of 146&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3 nanobricks can form in&#8197;situ a Li&#8722;Ga alloy layer at the polymer/anode interface. This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte, which can improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Broad&#8208;scope Syntheses of [11C/18F]Trifluoromethylarenes from Aryl(mesityl)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Treatment of aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts with 11C or 18F&#8208;labeled copper CF3 gives broad scope rapid and high yield access to radiolabled aryl trifluoromethyl arenes for PET imaging applications







Abstract
Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad&#8208;scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2=20.4&#8197;min) or fluorine&#8208;18 (t1/2=109.8&#8197;min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3. The mesityl group acts as a spectator allowing radiolabeled trifluoromethylarenes to be obtained with very high chemoselectivity. Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at meta&#8208; or para&#8208; position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96&#8201;%). Ortho&#8208;substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34&#8201;%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially useful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminopyridine, as examples of small drug&#8208;like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81&#8201;%).

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade biotransformations involving styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement via a stereospecific and trans&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;H or 1,2&#8208;methyl shift were developed for versatile and high&#8208;yielding chemical synthesis, including enantioselective synthesis of valuable chiral molecules from easily available alkenes or racemic epoxides and sustainable synthesis of useful natural products from bio&#8208;based substrates or renewable feedstock.







Abstract
Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines was achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8722;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids, and esters.

         <title>Rhodamine&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Photon Activation of a Red Light&#8208;Absorbing BODIPY Photocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very few rhodamine photocages exist and two&#8208;photon activation of BODIPY is not possible. A new rhodamine&#8208;BODIPY dyad combines the favorable properties of both chromophores and allows to liberate a target molecule by two&#8208;photon irradiation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent read&#8208;out enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Liberation of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitroaniline (PNA) upon one-photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent read-out enabled the detection of two-photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;Pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The building blocks that form the complex structures of the new phosphorus oxide nitrides P40O31N46 and P74O59N84 can be intergrown with further compounds. They are comparable to silicates in the Earth's crust, which is symbolized by a cutout of the disordered crystal structure. The background shows a typical diffraction pattern acquired with microfocused synchrotron radiation as used for the structure elucidation. More information can be found in the Research Article by W. Schnick, O. Oeckler and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203892).

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) depends on orientation. The DNA helix is depicted as a spiral staircase on which chromophore people stand. The CPL intensity, which is shown as helical light, varies depending not only on the distance between chromophores but also on their relative orientation. Helical structures of DNA duplexes are also illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300182).

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational flexibility between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain of the kinase Akt1 was investigated using multilateration of double electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) distance restraints. Detailed structural data of wild&#8208;type Akt1 and the cancer&#8208;associated E17K mutation in the apo and ligand&#8208;bound states are presented, yielding deep insights into the conformational plasticity of Akt1.







Abstract
The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3&#8197;K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analyzed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.

         <title>TBAI&#8208;Catalysed Formal [4+4]&#8208;Cycloaddition: Easy Access to Oxa&#8208;Bridged Eight&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economical approach for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles has been developed via TBAI&#8208;catalysed oxidative formal [4+4] cyclization of hydrazones with anthranils. This transformation involves the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in a one&#8208;pot manner, which breaks a limitation of anthranils in organic synthesis.







Abstract
TBAI&#8208;catalysed [4+4]&#8208;cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8197;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic set of triggering events is reported. The scaffold was applied to design a chemiluminescent probe that is activated by the enzymes &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase. The ability of the probe to detect the two enzymatic activities in bacteria was successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that chemiexcitation under physiological conditions. A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized. The probe emitted intense light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of responding to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule. We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in the preparation of chemiluminescent probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.

         <title>Coinage Metal Bis(amidinate) Complexes as Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Assembled One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different self&#8208;assembled one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymer types were synthesized by combining newly designed metalloligands with [Zn(hfac)2] or [M(acac)2] (M=Ni/Co) as linker. These polymers show either a linear or zig zag structure in the solid state.

The pyridyl functionalized amidinate [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)2]n was used to synthesize a series of bis&#8208;amidinate complexes [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M=Cu, Ag, Au) with fully supported metallophilic interactions. These metalloligands were then used as building blocks for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymers using Zn(hfac)2 (hfac=hexaflouroacetylacetonate) for self&#8208;assembly. Interestingly, the three coordination polymers [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2][Zn(hfac)2] (M=Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit a zig zag shape in the solid state. To achieve linear coordination geometry other connectors such as M&#8217;(acac) (M&#8217;=Ni, Co) (acac=acetylacetonate) were investigated. The thus obtained compounds [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2][M&#8217;(acac)2] (M&#8217;=Ni, Co) are indeed linear heterobimetallic coordination polymers featuring a metalloligand backbone with fully supported metallophilic interactions.

         <title>Bringing Machine&#8208;Learning Enhanced Quantum Chemistry and Microwave Spectroscopy to Conformational Landscape Exploration: the Paradigmatic Case of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been attracting increasing attention, but their structure in the gas&#8208;phase has not been investigated yet. Fluorination has a negligible impact on steric properties, but has a dramatic effect on the electronic properties. 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine has been efficiently synthesized in large amount and its conformational landscape has been disentangled through a combination of experiment and theory beyond the state of the art.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine, the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid. Fluorination of the methyl group significantly increases the conformational complexity with respect to the parent amino acid threonine. The conformational landscape has been characterized in great detail, with special attention given to the inter&#8208;conversion pathways between different conformers. This led to the identification of 13 stable low&#8208;energy minima. The equilibrium population of so many conformers produces a very complicated and congested rotational spectrum that could be assigned through a strategy that combines several levels of quantum chemical calculations with the principles of machine learning. Twelve conformers out of 13 could be experimentally characterized. The results obtained from the analysis of the intra&#8208;molecular interactions can be exploited to accurately model fluorine&#8208;substitution effects in biomolecules.

         <title>White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Approach All&#8208;Phosphorescent Device Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6&#8201;%, which is comparable with that obtained from all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple device architecture, low operation voltage, and insensitivity to the electrode work functions such that they have high potential in low&#8208;cost display and lighting applications. In this work, novel white LECs based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are proposed. The emissive layer of these white LECs is composed of a blue&#8208;green phosphorescent host doped with a deep&#8208;red TADF guest. Efficient singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) on the phosphorescent host and the subsequent F&#246;rster energy transfer from the host triplet excitons to guest singlet excitons can make use of both singlet and triplet excitons on the host. With the good spectral overlap between the host emission and the guest absorption, 0.075&#8197;wt.% guest doping is sufficient to cause substantial energy transfer efficiency (ca. 40&#8201;%). In addition, such a low guest concentration also reduces the self&#8208;quenching effect and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 84&#8201;% ensures high device efficiency. The phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs indeed show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6&#8201;%, which is comparable with all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs. By employing diffusive substrates to extract the light trapped in the substrate, the device efficiency can be further improved by ca. 50&#8201;%. In the meantime, the intrinsic EL spectrum and device lifetime of the white LECs recover since the microcavity effect is destroyed. This work successfully demonstrates that the phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs are potential candidates for efficient white light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial since most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared, in high yields, through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550 nm and the studies suggest an efficient spin orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet non&#8208;planar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements while DFT calculations enable to define a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether&#8208;Based Ion Transporters in Bilayer Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress of crown ether&#8208;based transmembrane ion transporters is summarized in this Review. The molecular design principles, working mechanism, dynamic regulation and biomedical applications of the crown ether&#8208;derived ion transporters are systematically analyzed. Additionally, future opportunities and challenges facing this field are discussed.







Abstract
Bilayer membranes that enhance the stability of the cell are essential for cell survival, separating and protecting the interior of the cell from its external environment. Membrane&#8208;based channel proteins are crucial for sustaining cellular activities. However, dysfunction of these proteins would induce serial channelopathies, which could be substituted by artificial ion channel analogs. Crown ethers (CEs) are widely studied in the area of artificial ion channels owing to their intrinsic host&#8211;guest interaction with different kinds of organic and inorganic ions. Other advantages such as lower price, chemical stability, and easier modification also make CE a research hotspot in the field of synthetic transmembrane nanopores. And numerous CEs&#8208;based membrane&#8208;active synthetic ion channels were designed and fabricated in the past decades. Herein, the recent progress of CEs&#8208;based synthetic ion transporters has been comprehensively summarized in this review, including their design principles, functional mechanisms, controllable properties, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this review has been concluded by discussing the future opportunities and challenges facing this research field. It is anticipated that this review could offer some inspiration for the future fabrication of novel CEs&#8208;derived ion transporters with more advanced structures, properties, and practical applications.

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;efficiency Bi&#8208;functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, waxberry&#8208;liked MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this core&#8208;shell structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface of MnS to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed excellent catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotential of it is only 320 mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81 V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3 mA cm&#8208;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300 h.</dc:description>

         <title>A Playground for Heavy Atom Tunnelling: Neutral Substitutional Defect Rearrangement from Diamondoids to Diamonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many diamond properties are defined by substitutional defects (i.e. a carbon atom replaced by another element), which may involve the formation of structural isomers that can interconvert. Herein, we analysed by computational means the structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of substitutional nitrogen, boron, and oxygen from small diamondoids up to the diamond bulk, focusing on the possibility of heavy atom quantum tunnelling rearrangement between the isomers. The large range of threshold energies and bond lengths lead to a variety of intriguing behaviours, including cage size dependent thermally activated tunnelling of nitrogen, and quantum delocalization of boron. In addition, we predict that applying an external electric field makes it possible to control the rearrangement thermodynamics and kinetics through tunnelling, which lets us hypothesize that these systems can potentially be used as atomic memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused in the last years.&#160;However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescent property and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phenolic/POSS Hybrids Provide Highly Ordered Mesoporous Structures Templated by High Thermal Stability of PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP Diblock Copolymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic living polymerization was used to prepare a diblock copolymer of poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl pyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP), and a phenolic resin with a double&#8208;decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) cage structure was used to form a phenolic/DDSQ hybrid (PDDSQ&#8208;30 with 30 wt% DDSQ). Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding could be confirmed through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block in PDDSQ&#8208;30/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, where increasing PDDSQ concentrations resulted in a higher proportion of hydrogen&#8208;bonded pyridine groups. After thermal polymerization at 180 oC, the self&#8208;assembled structures of these PDDSQ/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends were revealed by data from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the d&#8208;spacing increased with raising PDDSQ concentration. Because relatively higher thermal stability of the PDDSQ hybrid than pure phenolic resin and PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, we can obtain the long ranger order of mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids after removing the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, which reveals the high surface area and high pore volume with cylindrical and spherical structures corresponding to the PDDSQ compositions that are rarely observed by using pure phenolic resin as the matrix and could be used in supercapacitor application.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate additive for efficient and stable methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells by gas&#8208;quenching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, gas&#8208;quenching is considered to be a promising technique for perovskite film fabrication. However, when handling with methylammonium&#8208;free (MA&#8208;free) perovskites, it is often difficult to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films by gas&#8208;quenching. Herein, formate additives are employed to regulate the crystallization of MA&#8208;free perovskite, and improve the quality of perovskite films. Different additives of formamidine formate (FAFO) and potassium formate (KFO) is compared to investigate the role of formate groups in the crystallization of perovskite films prepared by gas&#8208;quenching. The FAFO additive facilitates the perovskite crystallization in (001) orientation whereas KFO favors for (111) orientation. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94%, compared to that of 20.14% for KFO devices. In addition, FAFO device also exhibits improved thermal stability in ambient condition without encapsulation, extending the T80 lifetime by 18 times compared to the pristine device.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Sulfoxidation Catalyzed by a Photoswitchable Iron Salen Phosphate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral iron(III) salen complex with a chiral photo&#8208;switchable phosphate counterion is reported for the sulfoxidation of alkenes in a stereoselective manner. Irradiation with light allows access to either enantiomer of the sulfoxide.







Abstract
Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)&#8208;configuration in up to 75&#8201;% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)&#8208;sulfoxides in up to 43&#8201;% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118&#8201;%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described Mn1 catalyst. This iron&#8208;based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may be used in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)-axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)-configuration in up to 75&#8201;% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)-axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)-sulfoxides in up to 43&#8201;% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118&#8201;%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described &lt;b&gt;Mn1&lt;/b&gt; catalyst. This iron-based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may be used in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutral Monodentate and Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Bis(enones): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). This study mainly explores two modes: ChB catalyst act on the promoter or reactant in the RC reaction. And the path of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction.







Abstract
Recently, the green and high efficient of chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been aroused great interest. In this work, the ChB catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). The mechanism was divided into four processes: the promoter addition process, the carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling process, the hydrogen transfer process, and the promoter elimination process. This study shows that the ChB catalyst could act on the promoter and reactant in the RC reaction, respectively. And the path 2 of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction due to a lower energy barrier. In addition, all six catalysts could achieve good catalytic effect. Analysis of the properties shows that the formation of chalcogen bond mainly promotes the charge transfer of LP(O)&#8722;BD*(C&#8722;Se) in the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation (key step), so that the charge of C(4) atom become more positive, thereby accelerating the reaction.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of the Structures and Magnetic Relaxation in Triangular Dy3 Complexes Based on a Tricompartmental Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tritopic hydrazone ligand provides a set of Dy3 complexes with similar overall topology but distinctly different binding modes of exogenous co&#8208;ligands, translating into very different magnetic properties. An energy barrier of &#8764;340&#8197;K and magnetic hysteresis up to 3.5&#8197;K are reached in the best case, and magnetostructural correlations are rationalised by ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Using a novel tricompartmental hydrazone ligand, a set of trinuclear Dy3 complexes has been isolated and structurally characterized. Complexes Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl, Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Br, and Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4 feature a similar overall topology but different anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or ClO4&#8722;) in combination with exogenous OH&#8722; and solvent co&#8208;ligands, which is found to translate into very different magnetic properties. Complex Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl shows a double relaxation process with fast quantum tunneling of the magnetization, probably related to the structural disorder of &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8722; and &#956;2&#8208;Cl&#8722; co&#8208;ligands. Relaxation of the magnetization is slowed down for Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Br and Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4, which do not show any structural disorder. In particular, fast quantum tunneling is suppressed in case of Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4, resulting in an energy barrier of 341&#8197;K and magnetic hysteresis up to 3.5&#8197;K; this makes Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4 one of the most robust air&#8208;stable trinuclear SMMs. Magneto&#8208;structural relationships of the three complexes are analyzed and rationalized with the help of CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations.

         <title>Synthesis and Densification of Mo/Mg Co&#8208;Doped Apatite&#8208;type Lanthanum Silicate Electrolytes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing the Mo6+ and Mg2+ dopants into the lanthanum silicate structure can increase the amount of interstitial oxygen and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures and expand the migration channel of oxygen ions to improve the ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Herein, a new co&#8208;doped method is reported to prepare highly purified polycrystalline powders of Mg&#8722;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+ and Mg2+ ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98&#8201;% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h with a grain size of about 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the pristine LSO to 33.94&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948; at 800&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+ doping contents was investigated systematically, in which La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948; possessed the highest ionic conductivity and relative density. The proposed Mo/Mg co&#8208;doped method in this work is one step forward in developing apatite&#8208;structured electrolytes offering excellent potential to address the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable electrolytes for solid oxide electrolysers and fuel cells.

         <title>An Atropisomerism Study of Large Cycloarylenes: [n]Cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;Pyrenylenes&#8217; Case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes of various ring sizes were obtained by coupling reactions at the 5,9&#8208;diiodo&#8208;pyrene. Since systematic studies of macrocyclic atropisomerization dependent on their ring&#8208;size remain challenging, these large cycloarylenes from 6mer to 8mer were investigated as illustrative examples according to simple assumptions.







Abstract
An atropisomerism of large cycloarylenes was studied using [n]cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes (n=6&#8211;21) as an illustrative example with two simple assumptions: (1) alternating configurations (R,S,R,S,&#8230;) are thermodynamically most stable, and (2) three consecutive identical configurations (R,R,R or S,S,S) are prevented. Ni&#8208;mediated coupling of a 5,9&#8208;diiodopyrene gave a series of directly&#8208;linked cyclic pyrene oligomers in one&#8208;pot reaction. As&#8208;synthesized cyclic hexamer was assigned as an (R,S,S,R,R,S) structure, converted into an (R,S,R,S,R,S)&#8208;form upon heating. Cyclic heptamer consists of two types of C2 symmetric structures predicted from assumption (2), one of which was convergent to one another by heating. Three atropisomers of cyclic octamer were analyzed from the possible five candidates by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the conversion process to (R,S,R,S,R,S,R,S) configurations upon heating was investigated. In total, according to two simple rules, the analysis of atropisomerism could be performed smoothly.

         <title>Thiophosphinoyl&#8208;Tethered Ylide&#8208;Substituted Heavier Carbenes: Synthesis, Structures and Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; X=Cl or Br) with a thiophosphosphinoyl&#8208;tethered ylide is reported. Their relative stabilities were determined by ylide transfer reactions and the first unsymmetrical heavier diylidylcarbenes accessed from chloro(ylidyl)tetrylenes.







Abstract
The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; X=Cl or Br) using a thiophosphinoyl&#8208;tethered metallated ylide (Y=Ph2P(S)&#8722;C&#8722;P(pip)Ph2 with pip=piperidyl) is reported, amongst the first ylide&#8208;substituted plumbylenes. The tetrylenes feature distinct trends in the spectroscopic and structural properties of the ylide ligand with increasing atomic number of the tetrel element. For instance, an increasingly high&#8208;field shifted signal for the thiophosphinoyl group is observed in the 31P{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum as a consequence of the increasing polarity of the element&#8208;carbon bond, which likewise results in a shortening of the ylidic C&#8722;P bond in the solid&#8208;state structure. The diylidyltetrylenes are unstable towards transylidation forming the mono(ylide)tetrylenes when treated with the tetrel dihalides according to the stability trend: Y2Pb&lt;Y2Sn&lt;Y2Ge&lt;YPbBr&lt;YSnCl&lt;YGeCl. Starting from the monoylide&#8208;substituted chlorotertrylenes the first unsymmetrical diylidyltetrylenes of type YEY&#8217; can be accessed, whose solid&#8208;state structures revealed that not the C&#8722;E but the S&#8722;E bond to the thiophosphinoyl group is most affected by the second ylide substituent.

         <title>Process Engineering and Glycosyltransferase Improvement for Short Route Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of GM1 Gangliosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1 gangliosides: Combined process engineering and biocatalyst improvement strategies are developed for chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1 gangliosides from (S)&#8208;Garner's aldehyde. Two key glycosyltransferases are improved on their soluble expression in E. coli and enzyme stability. The multistep one&#8208;pot multienzyme (MSOPME) process with the addition of a detergent in the latter glycosylation steps have been found to be highly efficient for obtaining GM1 gangliosides containing different sialic acid forms.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale synthesis of GM1, an important ganglioside in mammalian cells especially those in the nervous system, is needed to explore its therapeutic potential. Biocatalytic production is a promising platform for such a purpose. We report herein the development of process engineering and glycosyltransferase improvement strategies to advance chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1. Firstly, a new short route was developed for chemical synthesis of lactosylsphingosine from the commercially available Garner's aldehyde. Secondly, two glycosyltransferases including Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4GalNAcT (CjCgtA) and &#946;1&#8211;3&#8208;galactosyltransferase (CjCgtB) were improved on their soluble expression in E. coli and enzyme stability by fusing with an N&#8208;terminal maltose binding protein (MBP). Thirdly, the process for enzymatic synthesis of GM1 sphingosines from lactosylsphingosine was engineered by developing a multistep one&#8208;pot multienzyme (MSOPME) strategy without isolating intermediate glycosphingosines and by adding a detergent, sodium cholate, to the later enzymatic glycosylation steps. Installation of a desired fatty acyl chain to GM1 glycosphingosines led to the formation of target GM1 gangliosides. The combination of glycosyltransferase improvement with chemical and enzymatic process engineering represents a significant advance in obtaining GM1 gangliosides containing different sialic acid forms by total chemoenzymatic synthesis in a short route and with high efficiency.

         <title>Effective SrWO4/TiO2 Heterojunction with Enhanced Carriers Separation and Transfer for Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly effective SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated for photocatalytic methane oxidation into oxygenates with O2 under mild conditions. The high&#8208;speed transfer channel between SrWO4 and TiO2 on SrWO4/TiO2 photocatalysts promoted separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, which enhanced the generation of oxygenates with high selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic methane oxidation to oxygenates with promising performance remains as a grand challenge due to the low productivity and severe overoxidation. Herein, SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction was developed for photocatalytic methane oxidation with O2 to liquid oxygenates ( Please replace &#8220;oxygenates&#8221; with &#8220;oxygenated&#8221;)products under mild reaction conditions. The optimized SrWO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high productivity of 13365&#8197;&#956;mol/g with high selectivity of 98.7&#8197;% for oxygenates. Benefited from the intimate heterojunction interface of SrWO4/TiO2, the constructed I&#8208;type heterostructure improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, and a high&#8208;speed transfer channel for photogenerated carriers was fabricated. Simultaneously, the special band structure can increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes on the TiO2 surface, which promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species to enhance liquid oxygenates productivity.

         <title>Exploring the Electroluminescent Applications of Imidazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole emitters: In recent years, electroluminescent devices have flourished, and maximizing the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) has become the driving force and goal of a great deal of research. Imidazole derivatives have developed many excellent electroluminescent devices due to their structural diversity. This Review article discusses imidazole derivatives for fluorescent emitters and ligands as phosphorescent emitters and demonstrates their properties.







Abstract
Recently, the fields of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have improved tremendously with regard to tunable emission, efficiency, brightness, and thermal stability. Imidazole derivatives are excellent deep blue&#8208;green light&#8208;emitting layers in the OLED or LEC devices. This Review summarizes the major breakthroughs of various electroluminescence (EL) layers with imidazole&#8208;containing organic or organometallic derivatives, the molecular design principles, and their light&#8208;emitting performances as effective EL materials. The highly tunable chemical structures and flexible molecular design strategies of imidazole&#8208;based compounds are advantages that provide great opportunities for researchers. They can provide a good basis for the design and development of new EL materials with narrower emission and higher efficiency. Moreover, imidazole compounds have demonstrated breakthrough performances in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties where triplet excitons are utilized to inhibit anti&#8208;intersystem quenching, showing great promise in breaking the theoretical external quantum efficiencies (EQE) limits in traditional fluorescent devices.

The synthesis of spiroketals has gained attention because of their importance in chemical and biological reactions. Yet, the mechanistic investigation of mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization remains elusive and less explored in the literature and speculated that such transformations may proceed through the oxocarbenium ion intermediate; however, the existence of such species in mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization is not documented. The computational study has been performed at M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to examine the kinetically controlled product formation for such reactions and the intrinsic reaction coordinates of 1&#8201;d suggest that the reaction proceeds via a &#8220;one&#8208;step, two&#8208;stage&#8221; mechanism with the formation of transient oxocarbenium as a &#8220;hidden intermediate&#8221; in the reaction. This study reveals that stereoelectronic interactions devoid the formation of stable oxocarbenium ion intermediate after the proton transfer transition state in the mild acid catalyzed spiroketalization process.

Efficient methods for the synthesis of two types of furan&#8208;fused tricyclic compounds were developed based on a regiodivergent intramolecular carbometalation strategy using 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;alkynylaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;iodofurans as a common substrate. The methods involving the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;anti carbocupration or the formal intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;anti carbopalladation provide new access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized polysubstituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]furans and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>In situ H2O2 Generation and Corresponding Pollutant Removal Applications: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to offer a full&#8208;scale lens to discuss recent developments including fundamental process, design principles, and performance for pollutants removal from three perspectives like photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and chemical activation. Furthermore, the review try to analyze the challenges, and further envision the prospects of the H2O2 generation for pollutants removal in the future.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation from oxygen and water enables a sustainable environment to operate in an effective and green energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion way, which has attracted increasing interest in the fields of energy production and environment treatment. In light of this, tremendous progresses and developments have been made during the past decades in catalytic H2O2 production for pollutant removal from three perspectives including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis or chemical activation. Herein, we critically review the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments over various procedures of H2O2 generation and its further application, with the existence of photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and catalysts, respectively. Benefiting from extensively experimental and theoretical investigations, the performance and stability of H2O2 generation and its utilization can be maneuvered by devising catalytic platform based on numerous catalysts with predominant electronic, chemical and physical properties, which endow the catalysts with efficient electrons transportation, abundant active sites, and sufficient oxygen adsorption for H2O2 generation. Furthermore, this review also discusses the formation mechanism of H2O2 by 2e&#8208;ORR and 2e&#8208;WOR, as well as its functional process of activating and removing pollutants, and summarizes the design principles of various catalysts by focusing on the formation of H2O2. We finally highlight the specific challenges and prospects related to the utilization of catalysts and envision the possible future development trends in the fields of pollutant removal.

         <title>Carbonylmetallates as Versatile 2&#8208;, 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;Electron Donor Metalloligands in Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes and Clusters: A Global Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of various heterometallic carbonyl clusters containing metals that do not follow typical electron&#8208;counting rules can be readily explained by considering their constitutive 18e metal carbonyl fragment [m]&#8722; as a pseudo&#8208;halide, also similar to phosphido or allyl ligands.







Abstract
Carbonylmetallates [m]&#8722;, such as [MoCp(CO)3]&#8722;, [Mn(CO)5]&#8722;, [Co(CO)4]&#8722;, have long been successfully used in the preparation of hundreds of metal&#8208;metal bonded carbonyl complexes and clusters, in particular of the heterometallic type. We focus here on situations where [m]&#8722; can be viewed as a terminal, doubly or even triply bridging metalloligand, developing metal&#8208;metal interactions with one, two or three metal centers M, respectively. With metals M from the Groups&#8197;10&#8211;12, it is not straightforward or even impossible to rationalize the structure of the resulting clusters by applying the well&#8208;known Wade&#8208;Mingos rules. A very simple but global approach is presented to rationalize structures not obeying usual electron&#8208;counting rules by considering the anionic building blocks [m]&#8722; as metalloligands behaving formally as potential 2&#8208;, 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;electron donors, similarly to what is typically encountered with for example halido ligands. Qualitative and theoretical arguments by using DFT calculations highlight similarities between seemingly unrelated metal complexes and clusters and also entail a predicting power with high synthetic potential.

         <title>Columnar Liquid Crystalline Glasses by Combining Configurational Flexibility with Moderate Deviation from Planarity: Extended Triaryltriazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three curved aryl arms attached by rotation&#8208;allowing single bonds to a triazine core, together with only short alkyl chains, lead to a glass transition that yields a solid alignable hexagonal columnar mesophase at room temperature.







Abstract
Triply phenanthryl&#8208; and tetrahelicenyl&#8208;substituted triazine&#8208;hexaalkyl esters with short alkyl chains show glass transitions conveniently above room temperature within the hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline state, resulting in a solid columnar order at room temperature. As the hexagonal columnar mesophase is easily aligned with the director perpendicular to a solid substrate, such glassy columnar liquid matrices are aimed at for the orientation of guest emitters, to obtain anisotropic emission. A condition for face&#8208;on alignment on substrates are attainable melting and clearing temperatures, which is achieved with the moderately nonplanar tetrahelicenyl derivatives in spite of their short alkyl periphery. An unusual phase transition between two columnar mesophases of same hexagonal symmetry, but very different long&#8208;distance regularity of the column lattice, is found in one phenanthryl homolog.

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetric Conjugate Addition to Cyclobutanone: An Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of [6,5,4]&#8208;Fused Carbocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic desymmetrisation of 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanone through intramolecular cyclisation. This study allowed us to access the architecturally fascinating [6,5,4]&#8208;fused carbocyclic skeleton with excellent selectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 96&#8201;% ee) and yields. Finally, high&#8208;value products like &#947;&#8208;lactone and indan&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives have been synthesised.







Abstract
The first organocatalytic, non&#8208;destructive desymmetrisation of 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanone followed by intramolecular cyclisation is described. Owing to the slow activation of the pronucleophile by the weak Br&#248;nsted base, the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of ketones with tertiary&#8208;amine&#8208;derived Br&#248;nsted base catalysis has been chemically challenging in asymmetric transformations. Herein, we demonstrate that the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalyst works effectively for the intramolecular Michael addition of cyclobutanone to enones and affords the architecturally fascinating [6,5,4]&#8208;fused carbocyclic skeleton in good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 96&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, as a synthetic application, this method provides an alternative pathway to enantioenriched high&#8208;value products like &#947;&#8208;lactones and indan&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives.

         <title>Coexistence of Three Different Spin States in a Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Iron(III) Complex with an Unusual Fe III &#160;to Ligand Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a trinuclear iron(III) cyanido&#8208;bridged complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 (2[PF6]4) as the oxidation product of binuclear complex [CpMe3(dppe)FeIICN&#8208;FeIII(LN4)][PF6] (1[PF6]) (CpMe3 = 1, 2, 4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclo&#8208;pentadienyl, dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, LN4 = pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione&#8208;bis(S&#8208;methylisothiosemicarbazonato). Complex 1[PF6] possesses an intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S = 3/2) which couples antiferromagnetically to the &#960;&#8208;radical ligand (L&#8226;N4)2&#8208; and shows a LMCT (ligand to metal charge transfer) transition from (L&#8226;N4)2&#8208; to FeIII and the FeII &#8594; FeIII MMCT transition. Upon oxidation of 1[PF6], (L&#8226;N4)2&#8208; loses one electron to be the strong electron&#8208;attracting ligand (LOxN4)&#8208; and the intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S = 3/2) becomes a low&#8208;spin six&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S = 1/2) in 2[PF6]4. Also interestingly, 2[PF6]4 presents the coexistence of three different spin states (one S = 3/2 and two S = 1/2) and an uncommon FeIII &#8594; (LOxN4)&#8208; MLCT transition , confirmed by the experimental results and supported by the TDDFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Caffeine biodegradation by cytochrome P450 1A2. What determines the product distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and synthetic insights on oxidative homocouplings of alkynes mediated by alkali&#8208;metal manganates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting bimetallic cooperation alkali&#8208;metal manganate(II) complexes can efficiently promote oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes furnishing an array of conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes. The influence of the alkali&#8208;metal on these C&#8208;C bond forming processes has been studied by preparing and structurally characterizing the alkali metal tetra(alkyl) manganates [(TMEDA)2Na2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] and [(PMDETA)2K2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4]. Reactivity studies using phenylacetylene as a model substrate have revealed that for the homocoupling to take place initial metalation of the alkyne is required. In this regard, the lack of basicity of neutral Mn(CH2SiMe3)2 precludes the formation of the diyne. Contrastingly, the tetra(alkyl) alkali&#8208;metal manganates behave as polybasic reagents, being able to easily deprotonate phenylacetylene yielding [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4]. Controlled exposure of [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4] to dry air confirmed their intermediary in formation of 1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiyne in excellent yields. While the Na/Mn(II) partnership proved to be the most efficient in stoichiometric transformations, under catalytic regimes, the combination of MC&#8801;CAr (M= Li, Na) and MnCl2 (6 mol%) only works for lithium, most likely due to the degradation of alkynylsodiums under the aerobic reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;Iodanes: Substituent Effects and Pseudorotation/ Hypervalent Twisting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine (III and V) compounds exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivities of &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes. By judicious exploitation of sterics, the twisting process in iodanes can be facilitated to promote reactivity. For example, ortho&#8208;substitution in &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes accelerates &#945;&#8208;tosyloxylation of ketones and oxidation of alcohols. The enhancement of reactivity arises from sterically&#8208;induced non&#8208;planarity and the resultant weakening of the 3c&#8208;4e bonds involving the hypervalent iodine atom. The ortho&#8208;substitution constitutes an important strategy to maneuver reactivity, control selectivity, and develop new catalysts, including chiral, for diverse reactions. This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconjugated pterins are ubiquitous molecules participating in countless enzymatic processes and potentially involved in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen, amino acids, and nucleotides. Following electronic excitation with UV&#8208;A light, some of these pterins degrade, producing hydrogen peroxide as the main side product. This process, that is known to take place in vivo, contributes to oxidative stress and melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. In this work, we present for the first time mechanistic insight to the formation of transient triplet species which simultaneously trigger Type I and Type II photosensitizing processes and the initiation of degradation processes. Our calculations reveal that photodegradation of 6&#8208;biopterin, which accumulates in the skin of vitiligo patients, leads to 6&#8208;formylpterin via retro&#8208;aldol reaction, and subsequently to 6&#8208;carboxypterin through a water&#8208;mediated aldehyde oxidation. Additionally, we show that the changes in the photosensitizing potential of these systems with pH come from the modulation of their excited&#8208;state redox potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Long Persistent Phosphorescence in Coumarin&#8208;Phosphine&#8208;Based Coinage Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A coumarin functionalized aminodiphosphine has been introduced as a bidentate ligand in coinage metal chemistry. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trimetallic copper and silver complexes were synthesized by using this ligand. A hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with rich luminescence properties. These include coumarin&#8208;based blue fluorescence, observed as a sole emission in solution at room temperature, and green phosphorescence which is efficient at low temperatures and dominates the spectra of the metal complexes. In the rigid environment of frozen solutions, the green phosphorescence shows an unusually long (for metal complexes) decay on the time scale over seconds in high quantum yields. In addition, a red phosphorescence, which may be assigned to the triplet state localized in the phosphine&#8208;M3Cl2 (M = Cu, Ag), is observed for the trinuclear complexes at low temperature. Neither the second&#8208;long phosphorescence nor the red emission, are observed for coumarin ligand and thus, are a result of the coordination to coinage metal clusters. The excited states in these compounds were also investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ketyl Radicals Generated from Magnesium(I) Compounds: Useful Reagents for C&#8722;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pop the ketyl on. A variety of magnesium ketyls and related compounds have been prepared from the reduction of ketones with dimagnesium(I) compounds. These have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and EPR spectroscopy. The utility of ketyl radicals in both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208; C&#8722;C coupling reactions has been demonstrated (see picture).







Abstract
The aryl ketones, 9&#8208;fluorenone (fluor), 9&#8208;xanthenone (xanth) and 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone (anth), were reacted with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8722;, Ar=mesityl (Mes) or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dip)). This gave stable magnesium ketyl complexes which are monomeric, [(ArNacnac)(DMAP)Mg(fluor&#8901;)] (Ar=Mes or Dip, DMAP=4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) and [(MesNacnac)Mg(xanth&#8901;)(xanth)]; dimeric, [{(MesNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;fluor&#8901;)}2], or tetrameric, [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;anth&#8901;)}4]. In contrast, di&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylketone (OCPy2) is doubly reduced with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] (Xyl=xylyl) to give a diamagnetic alkoxy/amido complex, [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OCPy2)]. These complexes have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and in three cases, EPR spectroscopy. Regioselective C&#8722;C hetero&#8208;coupling reactions between magnesium ketyls and phenanthroline (phen) have yielded the alkoxy compounds, [(MesNacnac)Mg(OCR2&#8208;2&#8208;phen)] (OCR2=xanth, OCPh2 or OC(Ph)(2&#8208;Me&#8722;Ph)). In addition, homo&#8208; C&#8722;C couplings of the enones, chalcone (chalc) and dibenziylideneactetone (DBA), using magnesium(I) reducing agents, have afforded dimagnesium enolates, [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;chalc2)] (Ar=Mes or Xyl) and [{(DipNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;DBA2)]. A pinacol coupling reaction between [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] and 2&#8208;adamantanone (OAd) yielded [{(DipNacnac)(OAd)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OAd2)], presumably via a ketyl intermediate. This study further highlights the utility magnesium(I) compounds have as selective reducing agents in organic transformations.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Calix[6]arene Pseudorotaxane Empowered by Fluorophoric Dansyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, composed by a dansyl calix[6]arene and a bipyridinium axle, is presented. The disassembly of this complex can be triggered by: i) protonation of the dansyl units (chemical stimulus); ii) electrochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit (electrochemical stimulus); iii) photochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit, enabled by photoinduced electron transfer from the dansyl units (light stimulus). Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be employed to control the stability of this novel pseudorotaxane.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization, by means of NMR and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques, of a dansyl calix[6]arene derivative and of its pseudorotaxane complex with a bipyridinium&#8208;based axle. This novel macrocycle shows remarkable complexation ability, in analogy with parent compounds, while the dansyl moieties impart valuable features to the system. Indeed, these units: i) signal the state of the system by fluorescence; ii) can be reversibly protonated, enabling the modulation of the complexation abilities of the macrocycle; iii) participate in photoinduced electron transfer processes, which may be exploited to tune the stability of the supramolecular complex. Therefore, in this multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, the threading and de&#8208;threading motions of the molecular components can be modulated either by protonation of the calixarene host or by reduction of the bipyridinium guest, which can be accomplished both by electrochemical reduction and via photoinduced electron transfer. Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be used to induce molecular movements of the pseudorotaxane components.

Two heterometal polyphosphorus compounds with cyclo&#8208;P3 and norborane&#8208;P7 skeletons were formed by intramolecular cooperative yttrium hydride/LiPPh2 mediated activation of P4, while a pyramid&#8208;like P(PH)3 moiety was constructed from P4 functionalization using single metal specie (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2.







Abstract
The rare&#8208;earth/lithium cooperative effect on functionalization of white phosphorus has been investigated. The reaction of diazabutadiene&#8208;supported yttrium hydride chelated a LiPPh2 molecule (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2[&#956;&#8208;PPh2(Li)] (1, L=N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene) with P4 gave two novel mixed Y/Li multinuclear polyphosphorus complexes (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2[cyclo&#8208;P3]Li(THF)3 (2) and [Li(THF)4]+[(LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(norborane&#8208;P7)Li(THF)]&#8722; (3), accompanied with the elimination of diphosphorus compound Ph2PPPh2 (4) and H2. However, the comparative reaction of yttrium hydride (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2 with P4 afforded a trinuclear yttrium pyramid&#8208;P4 complex (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(&#956;3&#8208;P(PH)3) (5). Further investigations show that 5 cannot continuously react with LiPPh2 to form 2 and 3, and LiPPh2 reacted with P4 to form a Zintl&#8208;P7 lithium complex (TMEDA&#8901;Li)3(Zintl&#8208;P7) (6) and 4. These results indicated that the cooperation of Y/Li for activation of P4 is a key for the formation of 2 and 3. All new compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>{V6} Ring Sandwiched Polyoxoniobate as Molecular Electrocatalyst for Oxidant&#8208;Free Synthesis of Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A recyclable molecular electrocatalyst, sandwich&#8208;type Na2K6H14[(VIVO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;31H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.5&#8197;C2H8N2 has been successfully assembled, which can efficiently promote the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides with high selectivity and Faraday efficiency.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules to value&#8208;added chemicals has attracted recent attention. Although a series of transition metal based electrocatalytic materials have been developed, the lack of precise structure information generates great challenges in understanding the catalytic mechanism at a molecular level. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a molecular electrocatalyst, Na2K6H14[(VO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;31H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.5&#8197;C2H8N2 (abbreviated as V6(TeNb9)2), where a reduced {V6} ring is sandwiched by two trivacant Keggin&#8208;type {&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33}. V6(TeNb9)2 as heterogeneous electrocatalyst can selectively convert 95&#8201;% of thioanisole to sulfoxide with the Faraday efficiency up to 98&#8201;%. Notably, the important role of the embedded {V6} ring in the electrocatalytic oxidation was illustrated by comparing with {Nb6} ring sandwiched catalyst, Na5K7H4[(NbO)6(&#945;&#8208;TeNb9O33)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;17H2O (abbreviated as Nb6(TeNb9)2). Mechanism studies reveal that during the electrocatalytic oxidation process water is the only oxygen source and a key intermediate PhCH3S+&#8901; is involved.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Helicene&#8208;Containing Arenes for Optical Limiting Devices
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially helicene&#8208;containing arenes, are of great interest because of their important potential in organic devices. Two novel isomers including a helicene unit and a linear one have been prepared, where the helicene&#8208;containing arene exhibits a positive optical limiting response to its linear one.







Abstract
A helicene&#8208;containing arene and its linear analogue have been successfully synthesized and characterized, where the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the former can arrange in an offset packing style with a &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap. The introduction of pentagon&#8208;rings into the parent skeletons in the resulting compounds can boost the stability, and such helicene&#8208;containing molecule possesses higher solubility in organic solvent than the linear analogue. The structural difference has significantly influenced the optical limiting performance. The former in solution and in doped gel glass presents higher optical limiting response towards 532&#8197;nm laser than the latter. This study can enrich the functionalization of helicene, which can possess a positive effect in terms of nonlinear optical property.

         <title>Azo Appended Modified Lawsone Derived Ru&#8208;Systems with Multi&#8208;Redox Entities. Competitive Electronic Form and the Question of Azo Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bidirectional noninnocence of azo&#8208;appended modified lawsone (L1&#8722;/L2&#8722;) and its insensitivity towards azo reduction with special reference to that of pap has been addressed on multi&#8208;redox centre derived diverse Ru platforms.







Abstract
The article dealt with the ruthenium complexes of redox active azo appended modified lawsone L1&#8722; (HL1: (E)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyldiazenyl)naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione))/L2&#8722; (HL2:5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;p&#8208;tolylazobenzo[a]phenazine) derived [RuIII(acac)2(L1&#8722;)]/[RuIII(acac)2(L2&#8722;)] 1/5, [RuII(bpy)2(L1&#8722;)]ClO4/[RuII(bpy)2(L2&#8722;)]ClO4 [2]ClO4/[6]ClO4, ctc&#8208;[RuII(pap)2(L1&#8722;)]ClO4/ctc&#8208;[RuII(pap)2(L2&#8722;)]ClO4 [3]ClO4/[7]ClO4 and [RuII(CO)(H)(PPh3)2 (L1&#8722;)]/[RuII(CO)(Cl)(PPh3)2(L2&#8722;)] 4/8 (acac=acetylacetonate, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, pap=2&#8208;phenylazopyridine). The ligands L1&#8722; and L2&#8722; differed with respect to the para&#8208;quinone versus phenazine moieties linked to the azo function. Structural analysis of the complexes established unreduced state of the azo (N=N) group of coordinated L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; or pap as well as unprecedented para&#8208;quinone form of L1&#8722;. The involvement of selective redox center(s) towards the accessible redox steps of the complexes encompassing multiple redox active entities i.&#8201;e. Ru, phenolate (L1&#8722;/L2&#8722;), para&#8208;quinone (L1&#8722;), phenazine (L2&#8722;), azo (L1&#8722;/L2&#8722;, pap), diimine (bpy) was analyzed by combined experimental and DFT calculations. It revealed that under the prevailing competitive scenario oxidation was mostly dominated by the phenolate group of L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; (phenolate&#8594;phenoxide), while successive reductions were taken place either at the para&#8208;quinone/phenazine units of L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; or azo/diimine functions of pap/bpy. Though the azo function of pap in 3+/7+ underwent facile reduction, the same azo function associated with L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; conspicuously remained unreduced in all occasions. The frontier molecular orbital analysis revealed that the propensity of pap for the azo reduction with special reference to that in L1&#8722;/L2&#8722; could be correlated with its relatively lower energy &#960;* orbital (LUMO). Complexes displayed intense LMCT (1/5) and bpy (2+/6+), pap (3+/7+), L (4/8) targeted MLCT transitions in the visible region.

         <title>SnS&#8722;SnO2 Heterostructures Anchored on GO as a High&#8208;Performance Anode for Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work aims to improve conductivity and cycle stability of bare SnO2 through constructing special p&#8208;n heterostructures and graphene oxide (GO) modification to promote charge transfer and electrochemical reversibility, protect the intrinsic materials and alleviate volume expansion. Further, the band structure and charge state density of SnS&#8722;SnO2@GO were simulated by first principles, whose accuracy was verified in the practical experiments subsequently.







Abstract
SnO2 is a theoretically excellent transformed anode material with high theoretical capacity for SIBs. However, SnO2 faces serious volume effect and high resistance, which greatly damages its electrochemical performance. Given that, the SnS&#8722;SnO2 heterostructures is constructed with special internal electric field, which is beneficial to promote the transfer ability of sodium ions. Besides, the graphene oxide (GO) modification is carried out to isolate the intrinsic materials from direct contact with electrolyte, and alleviate volume expansion of the anode, ultimately promote the electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the structure and the conductivity characteristics of SnS, SnO2, SnS&#8722;SnO2 and SnS&#8722;SnO2@ GO are simulated respectively by first principles and are compared with the correspondence experiment results to verify the accuracy of established models. Owing to the special p&#8208;n junction in SnS&#8722;SnO2@GO heterostructures, the resistance of SnS&#8722;SnO2@GO can be reduced to 36.23&#8197;&#937;, much lower than that of SnO2 (Rct=341.9&#8197;&#937;). Notably, the combination of GO has effectively alleviated the volume expansion of SnS&#8722;SnO2@GO electrodes, and present excellent capacity higher than 384.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles. Thus, the efficient synthesis of SnS&#8722;SnO2@GO heterostructure electrodes with excellent performance for sodium storage is expected to provide valuable direction for SIBs anode materials.

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow in Fluoranthene&#8208;Containing Dopant&#8208;Matrix Systems: From Conventional Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence to Efficient Red TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the transformation from conventional room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence to efficient red TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. Red TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials with afterglow efficiency up to 13.1&#8201;% and afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s have been achieved, which paves the way for afterglow materials&#8217; applications in diverse areas.







Abstract
It remains challenging to fabricate highly&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;lived organic afterglow materials, especially in the case of red afterglow systems. Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5&#8197;eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red&#8208;shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1&#8201;% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s. Such high&#8208;performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemosensors: The combined effect of ESIPT and C=N isomerization in benzimidazole and the substituted aminobenzoic acids bearing Schiff base probes is responsible for different spectral output in solid and solution states. Furthermore, these ESIPT active chemosensors can sense Cu2+ through the inhibition of keto&#8208;enol tautomerisation.







Abstract
Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8211;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8722;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2 N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.

We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BIdm&lt;/b&gt; which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8722;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; N of benzimidazole group whereas in &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BIdm&lt;/b&gt;, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIo&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BIdm&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BIp&lt;/b&gt; selectively sense Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in semi aqueous medium with nano-molar detection limit and in HuH-7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Automated Glycan Assembly of Mycobacterial Hexaarabinofuranoside and Docosasaccharide Arabinan (Araf23) Motifs found on Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated assembly of oligo&#8208;arabinoses proves access to important tools useful in studying the cell surface of mycobacterium tuberculosis. Key to a robust process is protected orthogonal thiofuranoside building blocks that will be helpful for the synthesis of other arabinose containing glycans found in the envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.







Abstract
Mycobacteria are covered in a thick layer of different polysaccharides that helps to avert the innate immune response. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG) are ubiquitously contained in these envelopes, and rapid access to defined oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides is essential to elucidate their structural and biological roles. Arabinofuranose (Araf) residues in LAM and AG are connected either via &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans linkages that are synthetically straightforward to install or the more challenging &#946;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;cis) linkages. Herein, it was demonstrated that automated glycan assembly (AGA) can be used to quickly prepare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Araf as illustrated by the assembly of a highly branched arabinan hexasaccharide and a docosasaccharide arabinan (Araf23) motif.

         <title>Co Nanoparticles Confined in Mesoporous Mo/N Co&#8208;Doped Polyhedral Carbon Frameworks towards High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Co nanoparticles were confined in the mesoporous Mo/N co&#8208;doped polyhedral carbon frameworks, which showed enhanced ORR performances due to the formation of mesoporous structures induced by PMo.







Abstract
Exploiting effective non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we designed and fabricated Co nanoparticles confined in Mo/N co&#8208;doped polyhedral carbon frameworks (Co&#8208;NP/MNCF) derived from polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsuled metal&#8211;organic framework, which showed comparable ORR performance with commercial Pt/C and a larger diffusion&#8208;limited current density. Moreover, the Co&#8208;NP/MNCF also exhibited excellent ORR stability and methanol tolerance. These appealing performances can be attributed to the porosity regulation and heteroatom doping of metal&#8211;organic framework derived polyhedral carbon frameworks, which could be beneficial for the exposure of more active sites, the optimization of electronic structure and the mass transfer of electrolyte/electron/ion.

         <dc:description>CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M = Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (~20 m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c&#8208;axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Intermediates in the Reaction Pathway of SO2 on the CaO Surface: From Physisorption to Sulfite to Sulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, three surface sulfur oxide species were IR&#8208;spectroscopically detected on a CaO(001) single crystal surface. Polarisation dependent infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory were used to identify the chemical nature of the adsorbates as a physisorbate and two different chemisorbates.







Abstract
The interaction of CaO and Ca(OH)2 with solvated or gaseous SO2 plays a crucial role in the corrosion of urban infrastructure by acid rain or in the removal of SO2 from flue gas. We carried out a combined spectroscopic and theoretical investigation on the interaction of SO2 with a CaO(001) single crystal. First, the surface chemistry of SO2 was investigated at different temperatures using polarization&#8208;resolved IR reflection absorption spectroscopy. Three species were identified, and an in&#8208;depth density functional theory study was carried out, which allowed deriving a consistent picture. Unexpectedly, low temperature exposure to SO2 solely yields a physisorbed species. Only above 100&#8197;K, the transformation of this weakly bound adsorbate first to a chemisorbed sulfite and then to a sulfate occurs, effectively passivatating the surface. Our results provide the basis for more efficient strategies in corrosion protection of urban infrastructure and in lime&#8208;based desulfurization of flue gas.

         <title>C versus O Protonation in Zincate Anions: A Simple Gas&#8208;Phase Model for the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why do organozinc reagents survive instantaneous protolysis in protic media? A gas&#8208;phase model shows that the protonation of the organyl group, although thermodynamically strongly favored, is outcompeted by the protonation of a hydroxy ligand.







Abstract
For better understanding the intrinsic reactivity of organozinc reagents, we have examined the protolysis of the isolated zincate ions Et3Zn&#8722;, Et2Zn(OH)&#8722;, and Et2Zn(OH)2Li&#8722; by 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol in the gas phase. The protonation of the hydroxy groups and the release of water proceed much more efficiently than the protonation of the ethyl groups and the liberation of ethane. Quantum&#8208;chemical computations and statistical&#8208;rate theory calculations fully reproduce the experimental findings and attribute the lower reactivity of the more basic ethyl moiety to higher intrinsic barriers, which override the thermodynamic preference for its protonation. Thus, our minimalistic gas&#8208;phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.

         <title>Enhancement of NIR&#8208;Absorbing Ability of Bis(diarylmethylium)&#8208;Type Dicationic Dyes Based on an Ortho&#8208;Substitution Strategy.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ortho&#8208;substitution strategy is key for controlling both steric and electronic effects of bis(diarylmethylium)&#8208;type dicationic dyes. It was proven to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning of their LUMO levels, resulting in the red&#8208;shift and enhancement of NIR&#8208;absorbing abilities (see picture).







Abstract
Electrochromic systems capable of switching near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are fascinating from the viewpoint of applications in the materials and life sciences. Although 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethanes (AQDs) with a folded form undergo one&#8208;stage two&#8208;electron oxidation to produce twisted dicationic dyes exhibiting NIR absorption, there is a need to establish a design strategy that can enhance the NIR&#8208;absorbing abilities of the corresponding dicationic dyes. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of AQD derivatives with various substituents introduced at the ortho&#8208;position(s) of the 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl group. X&#8208;ray and spectroscopic analyses revealed that NIR&#8208;absorbing properties can be changed by introduction of the ortho&#8208;substituents. Thus, control of the steric and electronic effects of the ortho&#8208;substituents on the 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups was demonstrated to be an effective strategy for fine&#8208;tuning of the HOMO and LUMO levels for neutral AQDs and twisted dications, respectively, resulting in the modification of electrochemical and spectroscopic properties under an &#8220;ortho&#8208;substitution strategy&#8221;.

         <title>Dynamic Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles Stimulated by Neutral Lewis Base and Anion Co&#8208;ordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dynamic metalloporphyrin [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles comprising of bis&#8208;functionalised Zn(II) porphyrin axle and pyridyl functionalised macrocycle components are prepared in high yield via active metal template synthetic methodology. Extensive variable temperature 1H NMR and quantitative UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titration studies demonstrate dynamic macrocycle translocation is governed by an inter&#8208;component co&#8208;ordination interaction between the macrocycle pyridyl and axle Zn(II) metalloporphyrin, which serves to bias a &#8216;resting state&#8217; co&#8208;conformation. The dynamic shuttling behaviour of the interlocked structures is dramatically inhibited by the addition of a neutral Lewis base such as pyridine, but can also be tuned via post&#8208;synthetic rotaxane demetallation of the porphyrin axle core to give free&#8208;base, or upon subsequent metallation, Ni(II) [2]rotaxane analogues. Importantly, the Lewis acidic Zn(II) porphyrin axle component is also capable of coordinating anions which induces mechanical bond shuttling behaviour resulting in a novel optical sensing response.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN = Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylides YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8208; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8208; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through pi bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8208;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Photodynamics of Fluorescence Emission and Singlet Oxygen Generation of Fluorogen Activating Protein&#8208;Malachite Green Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malachite green will rapidly decay to ground state via internal conversion after excitation, since the free rotation significantly decreases the energy level of the excited state. However, after binding with the fluorogen activating protein, the interaction will greatly restrict the excited&#8208;state rotation and allow the fluorescence turn&#8208;on and 1O2 generation.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled fluorogen activating protein (FAP)&#8208;malachite green (MG) complex is a well&#8208;established protein&#8208;ligand system, which can realize binding&#8208;caused fluorescence turn&#8208;on of MG and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation by MG iodination. To clarify the mechanism of fluorescence activation and 1O2 generation, the photodynamics of different halogen&#8208;substituted MG derivatives and their corresponding FAP&#8208;MG complexes were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The results show that the rotation of MG is restricted by FAP binding, which prevents a rapid internal conversion to allow a longer lifetime for the excited MG to undergo fluorescence emission and intersystem crossing. Moreover, these FAP&#8208;MG complexes exhibit notably varied fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL) and 1O2 yields. The study on the decay pathways indicates that such an anti&#8208;heavy atom effect predominately stems from the lifetimes of the excited&#8208;state species. The photodynamic mechanism study here will lead to more advanced FAP&#8208;MG systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Selective Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Desulfurative C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated bioconjugation reaction that enables direct installation of a range of desired moieties into peptide and protein scaffolds via C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation is described. The method is rapid, operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere and can be utilized to incorporate general tools for chemical biology, including effective PTM mimics, via a stable, biogenic hydrocarbon linkage.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated reaction is described that enables the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM&#8208;mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.

         <title>Ge32Co9&#8722;x: Creating &#8220;Empty&#8221; Space by High Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable phase Ge32Co9&#8722;x has been synthesized at high&#8208;pressure and temperature. It adopts a new structure type with three&#8208;core heteroclusters and unique chemical bonding. Units of three condensed cubes interconnect by sharing vertices and edges. As a result, two congruent frameworks interpenetrate while being separated by &#8220;empty space&#8221; housing lone pairs and covalent Ge&#8722;Ge bonds.







Abstract
The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x=0.54(6), a=10.9861(3)&#8197;&#197;, space group Im
m) prepared under high pressure and at high temperature is metastable under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8722;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real&#8208;space methods revealed three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8722;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms. The electrical conductivity is metal&#8208;like.

Abstract
Herein, we report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951;1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl2(PPh3)2 and biomass material &#946;&#8208;pinene via C&#8722;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapor deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;&#951;,1&#8208;&#963;)&#8208;methylene(2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)](&#951;5&#8208;methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.&#8201;e. (seco&#8208;pinene)(MeCp)Co) is well suited for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Co3O4 and CoS2 thin films, and the deposited Co3O4 and CoS2 films are able to conformally cover trench structures with a fairly high aspect ratio of 10&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Two Rings Around One Ball: Stability and Charge Localization of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] Complex Ions of [10]CPP and C60/70[*]</title>

Stability and charge distribution of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complex ions of [10]cycloparaphenylene with C60 and C70 are studied in energy resolved gas&#8208;phase collision experiments. The novel [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in solution. Thermodynamic insight is obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. DFT analyses as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data.







Abstract
We investigate the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of noncovalent complexes of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with C60 and C70 by means of atmospheric pressure photoionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The literature&#8208;known [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, namely [10]CPP&#8835;C60 and [10]CPP&#8835;C70, are observed as radical cations and anions. Their stability and charge distribution are studied using energy&#8208;resolved collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ER&#8208;CID). These measurements reveal that complexes with a C70 core exhibit a greater stability and, on the other hand, that the radical cations are more stable than the respective radical anions. Regarding the charge distribution, in anionic complexes charges are exclusively located on C60 or C70, while the charges reside on [10]CPP in the case of cationic complexes. [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes of the ([10]CPP2&#8835;C60/70)+&#8901;/&#8722;&#8901; type are observed for the first time as isolated solitary gas&#8208;phase species. Here, C60&#8208;based [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are less stable than the respective C70 analogues. By virtue of the high stability of cationic [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes show a strongly reduced stability of the radical cations. DFT analyses of the minimum geometries as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data. Furthermore, our novel gas&#8208;phase [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Insights into the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process as well as the species distribution are derived from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements.

         <title>Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.

Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block&#8208;localized wavefunction method (BLW&#8208;ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi&#8208;open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&#8722; to I&#8722;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi&#8208;open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi&#8208;open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.

     alt="Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.

         <title>Enhancing the Magnetization Blocking Energy of Biradical&#8208;Metal System by Merging Discrete Complexes into One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>

The pentanuclear fragments and one&#8208;dimensional chains of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f are achieved using a new nitronyl nitroxide biradical through changing reaction temperature. The different magnetic relaxation features are observed for two Dy derivatives, in which the enhanced magnetic relaxation behavior of 1D compound could be attributed to the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic interaction.







Abstract
The reaction of nitronyl nitroxide biradical NITPhMeImbis [5&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;oxido&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene] with Ln(hfac)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O and Cu(hfac)2 (hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate), led to two series of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f complexes, namely, nona&#8208;spin clusters, [Ln2Cu3(hfac)12(NITPhMeImbis)2] (Ln=Gd 1, Dy 2), or one&#8208;dimensional chains [LnCu2(hfac)7(NITPhMeImbis)] (Ln=Y 3, Dy 4, Tb 5) depending on the temperature of the reaction. All five complexes contain a biradical&#8208;Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the LnIII ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.&#8201;e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)2 links two biradical&#8208;Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical&#8208;Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)2 unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, a terminal Cu(hfac)2 unit is coordinated to the imidazole&#8208;N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2, whereas 4 and 5 exhibit a typical single&#8208;chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.

         <title>Probing Peptidylprolyl Bond cis/trans Status Using Distal 19F NMR Reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine in model peptides provides an accurate and non&#8208;biased reporter of peptidylprolyl cis&#8208;trans conformational status by 19F NMR at physiological pH, even when several residues away from proline. In simple models, the prolyl bond conformational populations are predominantly governed by the amino acids local to proline and are conserved across different model systems.







Abstract
A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH&#8197;7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.

         <title>Fabricating Robust Pt Clusters on Sn&#8208;Doped CeO2 for CO Oxidation: A Deep Insight into Support Engineering and Surface Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported on a simple Sn&#8208;doped CeO2 approach to create oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, and investigated the impact of such vacancies on the CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalysts. The oxygen vacancies were found to limit Pt agglomeration and promote a smaller particle size of the Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalyst. The smaller particle size led to more exposed active sites, which enhanced the ability to activate oxygen and improve the catalytic activity towards CO oxidation.







Abstract
The size effect on nanoparticles, which affects the catalysis performance in a significant way, is crucial. The tuning of oxygen vacancies on metal&#8208;oxide support can help reduce the size of the particles in active clusters of Pt, thus improving catalysis performance of the supported catalyst. Herein, Ce&#8722;Sn solid solutions (CSO) with abundant oxygen vacancies have been synthesized. Activated by simple CO reduction after loading Pt species, the catalytic CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO was significantly better than that of Pt/CeO2. The reasons for the elevated activity were further explored regarding ionic Pt single sites being transformed into active Pt clusters after CO reduction. Due to more exposed oxygen vacancies, much smaller Pt clusters were created on CSO (ca. 1.2&#8197;nm) than on CeO2 (ca. 1.8&#8197;nm). Consequently, more exposed active Pt clusters significantly improved the ability to activate oxygen and directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CSO catalysts in vehicle emission control applications.

         <title>l&#8208;Serine is the Direct Precursor for the Pyrazine Ring Construction in the Biosynthesis of 3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;Methoxypyrazine in Bell Pepper Fruits (Capsicum annuum L.)</title>

The biosynthetic pathway of 3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) was investigated in plants using in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. It has been demonstrated that photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine serves as a C2&#8208;builing block and an N&#8208;donor in IBMP&#8208;biosynthesis.







Abstract
3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is an extremely potent odorant and responsible for the specific aroma of many fruits and vegetables. Especially bell pepper contains high levels of IBMP, which is the character impact compound of its typical aroma. However, since the discovery of methoxypyrazines in plants in the 1960s the biosynthesis of their pyrazine ring motif remained so far unknown. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP was investigated by feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. For the first time it could be shown that l&#8208;serine plays a key role in the pyrazine ring construction of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs). Based on HS&#8208;SPME&#8208;GCxGC&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analysis, it is shown that the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP is closely linked to photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine.

         <title>Tin Active Sites Confined in Zeolite Framework as a Promising Shape&#8208;Selective Catalyst for Ethylene Oxide Hydration</title>

Topotactic conversion of germanosilicate UTL into stannosilicates Sn&#8208;PCR with various Sn contents have been realized through post&#8208;synthesis strategy. The Sn&#8208;PCR&#8208;20 (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for eco&#8208;efficient production of glycol.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;selective stannosilicates have been post&#8208;synthesized for the hydration of epoxide to diols. A simple acid treatment has been employed to remove extensively the interlayer double four ring units, converting the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UTL germanosilicate into a 2D layered IPC&#8208;1P intermediate. Isomorphous incorporation of tetrahedrally coordinated Sn active centers was realized via solid&#8208;liquid treatment of IPC&#8208;1P with diammonium hexachlorostannate aqueous solution, which was accompanied by the spontaneous condensation of neighboring silica&#8208;rich cfi layers upon calcination and structural construction of a 3D PCR structure. Sn&#8208;PCR stannosilicates with tunable Sn contents were thus prepared. With Sn&#8208;derived robust Lewis acidity confined in the intersecting 10&#8208; and 8&#8208;ring channels, the Sn&#8208;PCR (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for the hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) into ethylene glycol (EG), exhibiting a remarkable EO conversion (99.5&#8201;%) as well as a steady EG selectivity (&gt;98.4&#8201;%) at greatly reduced H2O/EO molar ratio and near&#8208;ambient reaction temperature.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Behavior of 7&#8208;Azaindole for Mechanistic Investigation of Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling and Application to 7&#8208;Azaindole Based Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system, Chan&#8208;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;azaindole is discussed. A new mechanism confirming the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species for the cross&#8208;coupling pathway is proposed by identifying and characterizing key reaction intermediates through detailed spectroscopic, crystallographic investigations, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. A 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor, important in the medical field, is synthesized via sequential arylation.







Abstract
Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system for the N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically. A suitable mechanism has been proposed using the dimeric copper(II) complex as a catalyst for the coupling reactions. The role of DBU as a base and also as an auxiliary ligand in the course of the reaction has been established. The transmetalated monomeric aryl&#8208;copper(II) species generated from the dimeric unit is oxidized by another equivalent of copper(II) to yield an aryl&#8208;copper(III) intermediate for facile N&#8208;arylation, which has been authenticated with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The regeneration of the copper(II)&#8208;catalyst by aerial oxidation of colorless copper(I) species (generated via reductive elimination and disproportionation step) is confirmed by mass and absorption spectroscopy. Detailed DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations help to rationalize the proposed reaction intermediates and their corresponding electronic transitions. Moreover, the confirmation of copper(I)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole intermediate via HRMS reaffirmed the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species in the Chan&#8208;Lam type of coupling. A medicinally&#8208;important 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor has been synthesized via sequential arylation.

Introduction of the Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(B)&#8208;determinant into a versatile Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose precursor followed by mono&#8208; or difucosylation afforded, after deprotection, the B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide and the B&#8208;hexasaccharide structures, which were conjugated to BSA to yield glycoconjugates. Initial inhibition studies investigates the dependence of the binding to H. pylori strains on loading and the presence of B (Gal) and Lewis (Fuc) determinants.







Abstract
Infecting the stomach of almost 50&#8201;% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions between bacterial membrane&#8208;bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, the synthesis of a B&#8208;antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof is reported to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B&#8208;determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B&#8208;determinant in the Bleb7&#8208;conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6&#8208;conjugate.

         <title>Role of Counterions in the Structural Stabilisation of Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks

Revealing the role of counterions: Redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic frameworks often rely on counterions to access specific charge states of the components. We show, through a quantum chemical investigation, that the counterion can play an important steric role in the structural stabilisation of such frameworks beyond pure charge balancing effects.







Abstract
The crystal structures of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox&#8208;active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox&#8208;active ligand 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, V2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full&#8208;potential first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride&#8208;like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.

         <title>Effect of Mini&#8208;PEGs Modification on the Enzymatic Digestion of D&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Peptides under the Action of PROK
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mini&#8208;PEGs modified D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides were synthesized. It was determined that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification promoted the enzymatic cleavage of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides under the action of serine&#8208;like proteases.







Abstract
It was previously reported that D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides exhibited the ability to resist enzymatic hydrolysis. This study investigated the influence of mini&#8208;PEGs modification on enzymatic hydrolysis ability of D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides. The results showed that PEGylation promoted enzymatic hydrolysis of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide, especially, the cleavage rate of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide 6&#8208;w with PEG3 modification at the N&#8208;ends was up to 17 times higher in the presence of proteinase K (PROK) compared to those without PEG3 modification. Moreover, analysis of the enzymatic cleavage sites demonstrated a similar cleavage pattern of the PEGylated D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide to that of the unmodified peptide. The computational simulations further showed that the enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis ability can be attributed to the strong interaction between PROK and the peptide after PEG3 modification and the resulting formation of a mature catalytic triad structure.

         <title>Bimetallic Nickel Complexes Supported by a Planar Macrocyclic Diphosphoranide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel promotes the formation of a highly unusual planar dinucleating macrocycle PONNOPONNO. Bimetallic dinickel complexes of PONNOPONNO contain direct metal&#8208;metal interactions and trans reactive sites. Control over the ligand architecture is obtained by tuning the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or traditional pincer architectures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal cooperativity is emerging as an important strategy in catalysis. This requires appropriate ligand scaffolds that can support two metals in close proximity. Here we report nickel&#8208;promoted formation of a dinucleating planar macrocyclic ligand that can support bimetallic dinickel(II) and dinickel(I) complexes. Reaction outcomes can be tuned by variation of the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or conventional pincer architectures.

Four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C Chelates are used as fluorescence dyes in biological environment. Their excited&#8208;state properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. Two chromophores show different features in cellulo depending on the nature of the anchored PEG chains. These findings underline that our approach can extend the information from FLIM and evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of functional fluorophores in a complex biological environment.







Abstract
Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360&#177;170&#8197;ps) as compared to in DMSO (&#8764;960&#8197;ps) at 600&#8197;nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced processes in functional dyes.

An isolable linear aminoborylene: A dicoordinate cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene isoelectronic with an allene undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation under photolytic conditions, intramolecular aryl migration in the presence of acetonitrile, one&#8208;electron oxidation with copper(I) halides to the corresponding haloboryl radicals, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like binding of CO and reduction of N2O, sulfur and selenium, the latter yielding a terminal boraselenone.







Abstract
A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP=2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An isolable linear aminoborylene&lt;/b&gt;: A dicoordinate cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)-stabilized aminoborylene isoelectronic with an allene undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation under photolytic conditions, intramolecular aryl migration in the presence of acetonitrile, one-electron oxidation with copper(I) halides to the corresponding haloboryl radicals, transition-metal-like binding of CO and reduction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, sulfur and selenium, the latter yielding a terminal boraselenone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)-stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TMP)] (TMP=2,6-tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR-spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation, leading to a doubly-fused C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron-bound allylamino ligand. One-electron oxidation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)-stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with chalcogens led, in the case of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;CAAC&lt;/sub&gt; bond and formation of the 2,4-diamino-1,3,2,4-dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC-chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8208;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to better spectra: Dynamic nuclear polarization, sparse isotope labeling, and methyl dynamics have been combined to yield site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein. For L7Ae protein in complex with guide RNA from box C/D complex, a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact can be spectroscopically isolated.







Abstract
Sensitivity and specificity are both crucial for the efficient solid&#8208;state NMR structure determination of large biomolecules. We present an approach that features both advantages by site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This approach uses modern biochemical techniques for sparse isotope labeling and exploits the molecular dynamics of 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups exclusively present in the protein. These dynamics drive heteronuclear cross relaxation and thus allow specific hyperpolarization transfer across the biomolecular complex's interface. For the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact is responsible for most of the polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Tandem Coupling Method for the Short&#8208;Step Formal Synthesis of Riccardin C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of riccardin C was achieved by a sequential five&#8208;steps four&#8208;component one&#8208;pot tandem coupling method. By optimizing each step, four individual units were connected by two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by diimide reduction and acid deprotection.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot reactions reduce reagent amounts and circumvent process treatments, such as work&#8208;up and purifications in multi&#8208;step reactions. In this study, we achieved the formal total synthesis of riccardin C through a one&#8208;pot reaction by simultaneously linking four units through two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by reduction and deprotection. Thus, this one&#8208;pot method comprised five steps and did not require the purification of intermediate reaction mixtures, which saves resources, such as reagents and solvents, and expedites the work process.

         <title>A Versatile Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization Route to Functional Polyesters from an Activated Diester Monomer</title>

Step&#8208;by&#8208;step: A versatile and efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization route is described for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined functional polyesters with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity by organocatalyzed transesterification of activated pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester of adipic acid with structurally diverse diols under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
This work describes a versatile and efficient condensation polymerization route to aliphatic polyesters by organo&#8208;catalyzed (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) transesterification reactions between an activated pentafluorophenyl&#8208;diester of adipic acid and structurally different diols. By introducing &#8220;monofunctional impurity&#8221; or &#8220;stoichiometric imbalance,&#8221; this methodology can afford well&#8208;defined end&#8208;functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non&#8208;activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring&#8208;opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.

         <title>Diverse Cooperative Reactivity at a Square Planar Aluminium Complex and Catalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural constraint imparted by a sterically demanding pincer ligand results in an unusual tetracoordinate aluminium Lewis acid that undergoes multiple modes of metal&#8208;ligand cooperative reactivity with ketones and CO2. Adding HBpin allows for the catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl&#8208;containing substrates and the reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent.







Abstract
The use of a sterically demanding pincer ligand to prepare an unusual square planar aluminium complex is reported. Due to the constrained geometry imposed by the ligand scaffold, this four&#8208;coordinate aluminium centre remains Lewis acidic and reacts via differing metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathways for activating ketones and CO2. It is also a rare example of a single&#8208;component aluminium system for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent at room temperature.

Due to the constrained geometry imposed by the ligand scaffold, this four-coordinate aluminium centre remains Lewis acidic and reacts via differing metal-ligand cooperative pathways for activating ketones and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also a rare example of a single-component aluminium system for the catalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a methanol equivalent at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Metallodrugs application: We delineate the main features of an experimental&#8208;theoretical integrated approach based on the use of metallodrugs to solve protein structures.







Abstract
Inorganic drugs are capable of tight interactions with proteins through coordination towards aminoacidic residues, and this feature is recognized as a key aspect for their pharmacological action. However, the &#8220;protein metalation process&#8221; is exploitable for solving the phase problem and structural resolution. In fact, the use of inorganic drugs bearing specific metal centers and ligands capable to drive the binding towards the desired portions of the protein target could represent a very intriguing and fruitful strategy. In this context, a theoretical approach may further contribute to solve protein structures and their refinement. Here, we delineate the main features of a reliable experimental&#8208;theoretical integrated approach, based on the use of metallodrugs, for protein structure solving.

         <title>Asymmetrical Platinum and Rhodium Dinuclear Complex Strongly Bound to Filled d
 Complexes by Unbridged Pt&#8722;Metal Bonds: Toward Heterometallic&#8208;Extended Metal Atom Chains</title>

Line up, line up! HOMO&#8208;LUMO interactions between metal d
 orbitals were used to synthesize hetero&#8208;xtended metal atom chains (EMACs) for tuning the number of nuclei and metal species. Mixing an asymmetrical Pt&#8722;Rh dinuclear complex with a LUMO in the &#963;* orbital and a mononuclear complex with a HOMO in the d
 orbital allows two&#8208;step multinucleation, affording hetero&#8208;EMACs with three well&#8208;aligned metal species.







Abstract
Heterometallic extended metal atom chains (EMACs) aligned with three types of metal were rationally synthesized by forming unbridged metal&#8722;metal bonds based on the interactions between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals at the d
 orbital. These chains form pentanuclear structures aligned as Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;M&#8722;Pt&#8722;Rh with relatively large formation constants of 5.0&#215;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pt and 6.3&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pd, while retaining their backbones in solution. In the case of M=Cu, the original Cu(+2) atoms were reduced to Cu(+1) during the synthetic process. Cu(+1) has an unprecedented trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The reported synthesis based on asymmetrical dinuclear complexes provides a guideline for the synthesis of hetero&#8208;EMACs to allow several analogs through judicious combinations realized by tuning the number of metal nuclei and metal species.

         <title>Pd/Co Catalyst with High Pd Atom Utilization Efficiency for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation at Room Temperature: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Put to good use: A Pd&#8208;doped Co (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was designed and prepared for hydrogenation of nitroarenes. Its catalytic activity was much better than commercial Pd powder (&gt;150 times) in nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction. This work might provide a simple and low&#8208;cost methodology to design and synthesize highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
Enhancing catalytic performance as well as reducing catalyst cost are the eternal pursuit for the catalysis community. Herein, a simple and effective palladium&#8208;doped cobalt (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was synthesized via galvanic replacement reaction for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with H2 at room temperature, delivering &gt;99&#8201;% yield of aniline with up to 158 times higher catalytic activity than commercial palladium powder. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that Co&#8722;Pd interaction leads to a decrease in electron density of Pd and the distance between Pd atoms that results in the enhanced catalytic performance. Further experiments indicated that the Pd/Co catalyst serves as a highly efficient, selective, and recyclable catalyst for a range of nitroarene substrates. This work might provide a green and sustainable methodology to design and synthesize highly active catalysts with high utilization efficiency of the noble metals in fundamental and applied research.

Essential structural features of the high&#8208;pressure phase Ge32Co9&#8722;x: The atomic arrangement is built from a uniquely distorted cubic primitive arrangement of Ge atoms. Ordered occupation of neighboring cubes by Co atoms forms heteroatomic three&#8208;core clusters Co3Ge16. These units condense to form two interpenetrating frameworks interlinked by covalent Ge&#8722;Ge bonds. The homopolar germanium bonding creates characteristic six&#8208;membered germanium rings.

         <title>Frontispiece: Detection of the Dark States in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Process of Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads: Insights from Optical Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unraveling the complicated photophysics of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compounds is not a trivial task, although it is critical to improve the performance of TADF emitters in OLED. In the Review by Zhao and colleagues (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203737), recent developments of using the transient optical spectroscopic methods to study the photophysics of TADF emitters are summarized, e.&#8201;g. the manifestation of the theoretically proposed spin&#8208;vibronic coupling effect and the three&#8208;state model describing the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) in time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra.

Like bright stars in a dark sky, sparsely 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups in the protein domain &#8220;illuminate&#8221; the binding pocket of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex for specific solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy of the interaction surface by localized transfer of their hyperpolarization to 13C&#8208;labeled adenosines in the RNA domain. This is enabled by specific cross&#8208;relaxation enhancement by active motions under dynamic nuclear polarization (SCREAM&#8208;DNP) in combination with homonuclear dipolar recoupling.

The construction of efficient biosensors for miRNA assay is essential for disease diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. CRISPR/Cas system possesses high fidelity, precise localization capability, and efficient cleavage activity, making it attractive in biosensing applications. In this review, the recent advances in the development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNAs assay are discussed.







Abstract
As important post&#8208;transcriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play irreplaceable roles in diverse cellular functions. Dysregulated miRNA expression is implicated in various diseases including cancers, and thus miRNAs have become the valuable biomarkers for disease monitoring. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas) system has shown great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation biosensors because of its precise localization capability, good fidelity, and high cleavage activity. Herein, we review recent advance in development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNA detection. We summarize the principles, features, and performance of these miRNA biosensors, and further highlight the remaining challenges and future directions.

         <title>Detection of the Dark States in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Process of Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads: Insights from Optical Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads type of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, the energy level matching of charge transfer singlet and triplet excited state (1CT and 3CT) and locally triplet excited state (3LE) is crucial for occurrence of TADF. Transient absorption spectroscopy is a useful method to study the dark states (3CT and 3LE) involved in TADF process.







Abstract
The photophysical processes involved in the electron donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are complicated and controversial. The recent consensus is that at least three states are involved, i.&#8201;e. the singlet charge transfer state (1CT), the triplet localized excited state (3LE) and the triplet CT state (3CT). It is clear the very often used steady state and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopic methods are unable to present direct evidence for the dark states, i.&#8201;e. the 3LE and 3CT states, as well as the interconversion of these states. Concerning this aspect, the femtosecond&#8208;nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic methods are in particular interests. Both the emissive state and the dark state can be detected in these spectra, and interconversion of the states involved in TADF process can be also revealed. This review article focuses on the recent development of using the transient absorption spectra to study the photophysics of the TADF emitters.

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8211;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 16, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In our study, we combined biochemical sparse isotope&#8208;labeling techniques, a unique DNP method, and well&#8208;established dipolar recoupling in order to create isolated polarization transfer chains that, for the first time, allow us to follow the polarization transfer chain from the protein to the RNA.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202203443).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Alexander Marchanka at the Leibniz University of Hannover and Bj&#246;rn Corzilius at the University of Rostock. The image depicts the local generation of nuclear spin hyperpolarization, which selectively &#8220;illuminates&#8221; the interaction surface of a ribonuclear protein complex for solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxynitrogenation of Carboxylic Acids with Cyanamides to Access Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, we describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;based Terpyridine Complexes as Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver complexes bearing substituted terpyridine or tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine ligands have been prepared and structurally characterised. The study of the anticancer properties of silver complexes with this type of ligands is scarce, despite the possibilities of combining the properties of the metal and the ability of the ligands for DNA binding. Here, the antiproliferative activity, stability, CT&#8208;DNA binding and mechanism of cell death of these types of derivatives are studied. High cytotoxicity against different tumour cells was observed, and, more important, a great selectivity index has been detected between tumour cells and healthy Lymphocytes T for some of these compounds. The CT&#8208;DNA interaction study has shown that these derivatives are be able to interact with CT&#8208;DNA via moderate intercalation. Furthermore, cell death studies indicate that these derivatives promote the apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic liquid&#8208;mediated approach for the synthesis of site&#8208;specific thioether conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.</dc:description>

Reacting 1 with group 14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R = tBu; 3: R = Me). With group 15 nucleophiles, first isolatable monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R = Cy, H; 5: R = Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8208;5 were isolated and electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes. These complexes bear formal chains of P5R&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217; (6: R&#8217; = tBu, R&#8217; = Me) in a 1,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern or P6R&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; units (7: R&#8217; = Cy, R&#8217;&#8217; = H, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = Me; 8: R&#8217; = Me, R&#8217;&#8217; = Ph, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = Me) in a 1,1,3&#8208;substitution as middle&#8208;decks stabilized by one {Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co} and one {Cp*Fe} fragment. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2, 3 or 5 by AgBF4 gave access to paramagnetic triple&#8208;decker complexes bearing P5R middle&#8208;decks in various coordination fashions (R = tBu (10), R = PPh2 (12)). For R = Me (11) a dimerization is observed revealing a diamagnetic tetranuclear cluster containing a unique dihydrofulvalene&#8208;type P10R2 ligand.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxyphosphoranes, Ph2P(OR)(O2C6Cl4) and the borane B(C6F5)3 generate zwitterions which act as FLPs to effect the alkylation of nucleophiles affording C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;H and C&#8722;Cl coupling products. A DFT study confirms these reactions proceed via FLP activation pathway, generating an alkoxyphosphonium intermediate and effecting alkylation of the nucleophiles, akin to the Mitsunobu reaction.







Abstract
The combination of the alkoxyphosphoranes, Ph2P(OR)(O2C6Cl4) and the borane B(C6F5)3 generates the zwitterions 3 which act as FLP to effect the alkylation of several nucleophiles affording C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;H and C&#8722;Cl coupling products. A DFT study shows the reaction proceeds via an FLP activation pathway generating an alkoxyphosphonium intermediate which effects the alkylation of the nucleophiles, akin to the Mitsunobu reaction.

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution from Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Triply Donor&#8208;Substituted Tristriazolotriazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accelerating effect of heavy sulfur atoms on intersystem crossing leads to phosphorescence at room temperature even in solution from tristriazolotriazines decorated via thiophene bridges with three bulky peripheral donor units.







Abstract
Most organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters do not show their RTP in solution. Here, we incorporated sulfur&#8208;containing thiophene bridges between the donor and acceptor moieties in D3A&#8208;type tristriazolotriazines (TTTs). The thiophene inclusion increased the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with the radiative T1&#8594;S0 pathway, allowing RTP to be observed in solution for all compounds, likely assisted by protection of the emissive TTT&#8208;thiophene core from the environment by the bulky peripheral donors.

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Alkaline&#8208;Earth Metal Amides Applying the In Situ Grignard Reagent Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. In addition, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups proved to be beneficial for the synthesis of calcium bis(amides). The addition of hydryl bromides or iodides to suspensions of calcium and imines in THF allows straightforward conversion to silyl&#8208;free calcium bis(amides) with bulky substituents.







Abstract
Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. For the synthesis of bulky amides alternative strategies are required and in the past, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups have been used to ease metalation reactions. The in&#8197;situ Grignard reagent formation in stirred suspensions of magnesium or calcium with hydryl halide and imine in THF allows the synthesis of a plethora of amides with bulky silyl&#8208;free substituents. Ball milling protocols partially favor competitive side reactions such as aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reactions. Calcium is the advantageous choice for the in&#8197;situ Grignard reagent formation and subsequent addition onto the imines yielding bulky calcium bis(amides) whereas the stronger reducing heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metals strontium and barium are less selective and hence, the aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reaction becomes competitive. Exemplary, the solid&#8208;state molecular structures of [(Et2O)Mg(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] and [(Et2O)2Ca(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] have been determined.

This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications.

The dually protonated intermediate produced from the Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#183;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp&#8208;lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is still wreaking havoc all over the world with surging morbidity and high mortality. The main protease (Mpro) is essential in the replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, enabling itself an active target for antiviral development. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a new class of peptidomimetics&#8208;constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AApeptides, based on which a series of aldehyde and ketoamide inhibitors of the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were prepared. The lead compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity in the FRET&#8208;based Mpro enzymatic assay not only for the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 but also for SARS&#8208;CoV and MERS&#8208;CoV, along with HCoVs like HCoV&#8208;OC43, HCoV&#8208;229E, HCoV&#8208;NL63 and HKU1. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic results demonstrated that our compounds form a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145. They also demonstrated effective antiviral activity against live SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Overall, the results suggest that &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AApeptide could be a promising molecular scaffold in designing novel Mpro inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other coronaviruses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8208;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#8710;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such a strategy required innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture, and its dependence on classical alkylation/acylation strategies to install reporter tags has restricted its applications on non&#8208;covalent compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8208;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H olefination with a arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#8710;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4db, a &#8710;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with probe 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#8710;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8208;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale probing of the supramolecular assembly in a two&#8208;component gel by near&#8208;field infrared spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. We introduce here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel to assess the system&#180;s heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides Enabled by Selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy has been used to cyclized of N&#8208;propargylamides. This method offers readily access to oxazole aldehydes under chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions with low catalyst loadings, where air acts as a terminal and gratuitous oxidant. The reaction is demonstrated with a range of substrates, including aryl and alkyl propargyl amides, and in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several amide&#8208;containing drug molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the acridinium catalyst is able to oxidize diselenide and generate singlet oxygen (1O2), which is responsible for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exchange Interactions and Magnetic Properties of a Molecular Mn18&#8208;Ring Complex</title>

         <dc:description>[Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#183;xAcOH (x = 6&#8211;9) represents a rare example of a compound containing molecular Mn18&#8208;rings. These are formed by Mn3(&#181;3&#8208;O) subunits in which the high&#8208;spin Mn(III) centers are bridged by three pairs of acetate anions (AcO&#8722;). An AcOH molecule coordinates to one of the Mn atoms leading to [Mn3(&#181;3&#8208;O)(&#181;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units, designated in short as Mn3&#8208;units, that are interconnected by acetate anions via the other two Mn atoms to form Mn18&#8208;rings. Magnetic measurements show weak ferromagnetic interactions between them that are suppressed in strong magnetic field. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on Mn3 model complexes using independently DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) show a correlation between the orientation of the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller axes of pairs of Mn(III) magnetic centers and corresponding exchange coupling energies. Weak coupling between Mn3&#8208;units within the Mn18&#8208;ring allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility vs temperature dependence in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;unit within the ring.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. The prospective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs have been presented here on my own opinions of the end of this concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions are examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). Then, the aromaticity is addressed via the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208; conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208;risking S&#8208;F bond formation:A gas cylinder&#8208;free strategy to access S(IV) and S(VI) fluorinated compounds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;fluorine partnership occupies a privileged position in fluorine chemistry given the functional versatility that it imparts to organic structures. Despite this, available methodologies to forge S&#8211;F bonds are limited compared to C&#8211;F bond formation. Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF4Cl, SO2F and SF3 derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)&#8211;F or S(VI)&#8211;F compounds is achieved by employing bench&#8208;stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. DFT calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF4Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox&#8208;free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine&#8208;tuning. Furthermore, first&#8208;in&#8208;class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF4Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post&#8208;transformations that allow accessing highly complex SF4&#8208;bridged scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Parameters by Rapid Colorimetric Assessment: Evaluation of Structural Components Found in Biological Ligands and Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding is a key molecular interaction in biological processes, drug delivery, and catalysis. This report describes a high throughput UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity using a pyrazinone sensor. This colormetric sensor reversibly binds to a hydrogen bond donor, resulting in a blue shift as additional equivalents of donor are added. Titration with excess equivalents of donor is used to determine the binding coefficient, ln(Keq). Over 100 titrations were performed for a variety of biologically relevant compounds. This data enabled development a multiple linear regression model that is capable of predicting 95% of ln(Keq) values within 1 unit, allowing for the estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement. To show the effectiveness of the single point measurements, hydrogen bond strengths were obtained for a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres. The values from the single point measurements were validated with full titrations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8209;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8209;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8209;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8209;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation State Tuning of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic dimers consisting of combinations of butterfly&#8208;shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and its chemically oxidized form phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (PTZSO2) have been synthesized. A twist is imposed across the dimers by ortho&#8208;substituents including methyl ethers, sulfides and sulfones. X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy, underpinned by computational studies, have been employed to study the interplay between the oxidation state, conformational restriction, and emission mechanisms including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). While the PTZSO2 dimers are simple fluorophores, the presence of PTZ induces triplet&#8208;mediated emission with a mixed PTZ&#8208;PTZSO2 dimer displaying concentration dependent hallmarks of both TADF and RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural complexity in the apparently simple crystal structure of Be2Ru</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural features of the hexagonal layered crystal structure of Be2Ru (a = 5.7508(3) &#197;, c = 3.0044(2) &#197;, space group P &#8208;62m) were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The residual electron density and high&#8208;resolution TEM images show that the real structure can be described as an intergrowth of the main hexagonal matrix of the Fe2P type with minor orthorhombic inclusions of its stacking variants. Such atomic arrangement is stabilized by the charge transfer from Be to Ru and by a system of polar three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic bonds involving both components. The calculated electronic density of states (DOS) of Be2Ru revealed, contrarily to typical intermetallic compounds, a pseudo gap (dip) in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of Be2Ru shows metal behavior in agreement with the non&#8208;zero DOS at the Fermi level.</dc:description>

         <title>HAV&#8208;peptides attached to colloidal probes faithfully detect E&#8208;cadherins displayed on living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological&#160;processes, including wound healing, barrier formationand tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin&#160;which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelialcells. To identify this molecule on the surface of&#160;cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical aminoacid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized&#160;and attached to solid supported membranes coveringcolloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies&#160;were established, one based on complexation of DOGSNTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the&#160;other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide usingin situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were&#160;performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attachto the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent&#160;attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield bylipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with&#160;HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of Ecadherinson living cells either using video particle tracking&#160;or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examinedconfirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide&#160;with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods werealso used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures&#160;and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essentialfor the development of novel biosynthetic materials&#160;given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medicalapplications.</dc:description>

Two different functionalization strategies&#160;were established, one based on complexation of DOGSNTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine-tagged HAV-peptide and the&#160;other one relying on the formation of a HAV-lipopeptide usingin situ maleimide-thiol coupling. Binding studies were&#160;performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attachto the membrane surface. Compared to the non-covalent&#160;attachment via the His-tag, we achieved a higher yield bylipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with&#160;HAV-peptides were employed to measure the presence of Ecadherinson living cells either using video particle tracking&#160;or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examinedconfirming the specific interaction of the HAV-peptide&#160;with the E-cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods werealso used to determine the number of single-bond ruptures&#160;and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essentialfor the development of novel biosynthetic materials&#160;given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medicalapplications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diverse Roles of ScSERF in Modifying the Fibril Growth of Amyloidogenic Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms SERF acted on different amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS&#8208;LC, FUS&#8208;Core, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal they share similar interaction sites on the N&#8208;terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while the fibrosis of FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC protein is inhibited by ScSERF. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin in organic cocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic spintronics has caused a huge revolution in creating highly&#8208;efficient low&#8208;power circuits. Spin manipulation in organic cocrystals has become a promising strategy to uncover more chemicophysical properties for diverse applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements of spin properties in organic charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals, and briefly describe the possible mechanisms behind them. Beside the known spin properties (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) in binary/ternary cocrystals, other spin phenomena in radical cocrystals and spin transport are also summarized and discussed. Hopefully, deep understanding of current achievements, challenges and perspectives will offer the clear direction for the introduction of spin in organic cocrystals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amides and esters with aromatic amines as nucleophiles. This method features high regiocontrol, diastereospecific SN2 reaction pathway, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions, furnishing a wide range of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives in a highly enantioselective manner. Notably, the selective nucleophilic attack to the C&#8208;4 position of epoxides is controlled by the directing effect of the pendant carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Approach to Synthetic Lectin for Glucose with Boosted Binding Affinity through C&#8211;H Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8208;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8208;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8208;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208; responsive materials and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 cd A&#8208;1 and 36.06 cd A&#8208;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#1060;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Bi bimetallic nanochains for&#160;electroredution of CO2&#160;to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during electrolysis is a major challenge.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium-bismuth (Pd&#8211;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid-based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1:7 to 9:1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios, and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3 mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of -2.3 V vs Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1:1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of -2.0 V vs Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid-based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites, and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol support Mtb&#160;growth, and are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb&#160;cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb&#160;cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will support further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb&#160;pathogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Triboelectric nanogenerators assembled by cobalt(II) coordination polymer incorporated composite films and their application for self&#8208;powered anticorrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A friction layer with stability and durability is important to promote the practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional cobalt coordination polymer (Co&#8208;CP) was successfully synthesized using cobalt nitrate, 4, 4', 4''&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine and 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine. To clarify the effect of the doping proportions of Co&#8208;CP and the types of conposite polymers on the output performance of the TENG,&#160;Co&#8208;CP was combined with two organic polymers having different polarities (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and ethyl cellulose (EC)) to form a series of composite films, which were used as the friction electrode materials to fabricate TENGs. Electrical characterizations indicated that a high output current and voltage were obtained from the TENG based on 15 wt% Co&#8208;CP incorporated in PVDF (Co&#8208;CP@PVDF), which could be further improved by the Co&#8208;CP@EC composite film at the same doping ratio. Furthermore, the optimally fabricated TENG was demonstrated to prevent electrochemical corrosion of carbon steel.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8211;N=C), were synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting p&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are (E,E) or (Z,Z). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as an electron&#8208;accepting building block for optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A BF2 Chelate Exhibiting Excimer&#8208;like Fluorescence with an Unusually Large Stokes Shift in the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The target mono&#8208;BF2 complex is weakly emissive in fluid solution because radiationless decay of the excited&#8208;singlet state is promoted through an intramolecular N&#8230;H&#8211;N hydrogen bond. The lack of mirror symmetry for this compound is attributed to vibronic effects, as reported previously for the bis&#8208;BF2 complex (BOPHY). Red&#8208;shifted fluorescence is observed from single crystals, the emission quantum yield approaching 30% with a fluorescence lifetime of 2 ns. The large Stokes shift of 5,700 cm&#8208;1 helps minimize self&#8208;absorption. Crystallography indicates that the internal fold and twist angles are increased substantially in the crystal, but the hydrogen bond is weakened relative to solution. The crystal structure is compiled from pairs of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail molecules having a shift of ca. 4.1 &#197; and closest approach of ca. 3.5 &#197;. These molecular pairs are arranged in columns, which, in turn, assemble into sheets. The proximity favours excitonic coupling between individual molecules, with the coupling strength obtained by analysis of the absorption spectrum reaching ca. 1,000 cm&#8208;1. Both the ideal dipole approximation and the extended dipole methodology seriously overestimate the coupling strength, but the atomic transition charge density procedure leads to good agreement with experiment. Emission is attributed to the closely coupled molecular pair functioning in an excimer&#8208;like manner with the exciton trapped in a local minimum. Increasing temperature causes a slight blue shift and loss of fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Shell and Kernel Modifications of Atomically Precise Pd/Ag Superatomic Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp = S2P(O i Pr)2&#8208;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2, contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count, and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200 &#956;s (&#955;ex =448; &#955;em =842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive. The catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol is demonstrated with 1&#8208;3 at room temperature.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first 8-electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp = S2P(O i Pr)2-) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55% yield.

         <title>Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone&#8208;like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon&#8208;independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of E. coli, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Optimization of Detergents for Membrane Protein Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane protein purification by means of detergents is key to isolating membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets. The role of the detergent structure in this process, however, is not well understood. Detergents are optimized empirically, leading to failed preparations, and thereby raising costs. Here we evaluate the utility of the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was introduced by Griffin in 1949, for guiding the optimization of the hydrophobic tail in first&#8208;generation, dendritic oligoglycerol detergents ([G1] OGDs). Our findings deliver qualitative HLB guidelines for rationalizing the optimization of detergents. Moreover, [G1] OGDs exhibit strongly delipidating properties, regardless of the structure of the hydrophobic tail, which delivers a methodological enabling step for investigating binding strengths of endogenous lipids and their role for membrane protein oligomerization. Our findings will facilitate the analysis of challenging drug targets in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Conglomerates Mixed Crystals to Deracemize a Stable Racemic&#8208;Compound&#8208;Forming System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence of that possibility is given on three examples by using Temperature Cycling Induced Deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Elemental Magnesium as an Early Transition Metal Substitute: From Pentafulvene Coordination to Deprotonation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of magnesium turnings and 6,6&#8208;di&#8208;para&#8208;tolylpentafulvene was investigated. Under mild conditions, the magnesium dissolves, forming the MgII complex 1 with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#954;1 coordinating ligand of the dimerized pentafulvene, analyzed by NMR and XRD investigations. As a magnesium pentafulvene complex was a possible intermediate, amines were employed as intercepting agents. Thereby, the amines were formally deprotonated by elemental magnesium, yielding the first examples of Cp&#8217;Mg(THF)2NR2 complexes. This reaction competes with the formation of 1 and a consecutive formal [1,5]&#8208;H&#8208;shift forming an ansa&#8208;magnesocene. Employing amines with low basicity gave quantitative conversion to the amide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Enantioselective Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition and Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation in Stereodivergent, Multicomponent Coupling Reactions to Form Three Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereodivergent dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to selectively prepare all four stereoisomers in molecules containing two chiral centers from common starting materials. Most processes involve the use of two substrates, and it remains challenging to use dual catalyst approaches to generate molecules having three newly formed stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Here we report a multicomponent, stereodivergent method for the synthesis of targets containing three contiguous stereocenters by the combination of enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition and Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation methodologies. Both cyclic and acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones undergo &#946;&#8208;arylation using aryl boron reagents to form an enolate nucleophile that can be subsequently allylated at the &#945;&#8208;position. The reactions proceed often with &gt;95% ee and with &gt;90:10 dr. Epimerization at the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl center enables the preparation of any of the eight possible stereoisomers from common starting materials, as demonstrated for cyclohexanone products.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Construction Of Molecular Borromean Rings And [2]catenane Utilizing Ether Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Cp*Rh&#8208;based discrete architectures were constructed through selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium(III) bimetallic construction units, respectively. This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D&#8208;shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6&#8208; to 1,5&#8208;position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean Rings under a similar condition. The above&#8208;mentioned constructions have been determined via the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry analysis and the elemental analysis.</dc:description>

This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D-shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6- to 1,5-position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean Rings under a similar condition. The above-mentioned constructions have been determined via the X-ray crystallographic analysis, the detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry analysis and the elemental analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids are abundant, low cost and environmentally friendly, direct convert carboxylic acids into valued&#8208;added compounds are in high demand. Herein, we report a Rh(I) catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl and alkyl carboxylic acid by using TFFH as activator. This protocol features excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance and a broad substrate scope including natural product and drugs. A gram&#8208;scale decarbonylative borylation reaction of Probenecid is also presented. In addition, the utility of this strategy is highlighted by a one&#8208;pot decarbonylative borylation/ derivatization sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide&#8208;BODIPY conjugates as bright fluorescent material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in a New Family of Photoactive Diimine&#8208;Diphosphine Copper(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of heteroleptic diimine&#8208;diphosphine copper(I) complexes is reported, with six new complexes compared to benchmark [Cu(bcp)(DPEPhos)]PF6. These new complexes are based on 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands with representative electronic properties as well as substitution patterns and DPEPhos and XantPhos as diphosphine ligands. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated and correlated with the number and position of substituents on the TAP ligands. Stern&#8208;Volmer studies using H&#252;nig&#8217;s base as reductive quencher demonstrated the influence of the complex photoreduction potential and of the excited state lifetime on the photoreactivity. This study refines the structure&#8208;property relationship profile for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes and confirms that such profiles are of high interest to design new copper complexes as optimized photoredox catalysts.</dc:description>
