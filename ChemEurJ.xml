         <title>Host&#8208;guest Interaction in Ethylene and Ethane Separation on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Revealed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture using MOFs as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1 H&#8208; 1 H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1~9.6 bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of Polyfluorinated Arenes and Functionalized, Masked Aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride&#8208;promoted, stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution of silicon&#8208;based aryl pronucleophiles decorated with sensitive functional groups and polyfluorinated arenes enables the synthesis of partially fluorinated biaryls. The mild transformation operates at room temperature, requiring less than one hour for completion. Hence, the functional&#8208;group compatibility is superb, and regioselectivities are improved compared to known couplings.







Abstract
A chemoselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of sufficiently electron&#8208;deficient fluorinated arenes and functionalized N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes as masked aryl nucleophiles is reported. The fluoride&#8208;promoted transformation involves the in&#8197;situ generation of the aryl nucleophile decorated with various sensitive functional groups followed by a stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). These reactions typically proceed at room temperature within minutes. This catalytic process allows for the functionalization of both coupling partners, furnishing highly fluorinated biaryls in good yields.

         <title>A Smart Access to the Dinitramide Anion &#8211; The Use of Dinitraminic Acid for the Preparation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Energetic Copper(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dinitramide anion was made accessible for complexation through the use of dinitraminic acid and basic copper(II) carbonate. The in&#8197;situ prepared copper dinitramide was complexed by 13 different highly endothermic tri&#8208; and tetrazole ligands. By the choice of ligand, complexes were obtained that possess thermal stability exceeding 200&#8197;degrees Celsius, one even capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The examined compounds were successfully ignited in laser experiments, with one complex even detonating.







Abstract
Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2, HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the in&#8197;situ preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, for example, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole, di(5H&#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)4(H2O)](DN)2, based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of initiating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#8197;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded to apprehend the ignition mechanism.

         <title>Extended Enolates: Versatile Intermediates for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Functionalization via Noncovalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extend and divert. Extended enolates may be generated by deprotonation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds smoothly, to react with a variety of electrophiles in&#8197;situ. Easier to form than the parent simple enolates, di&#8208; and trienolates present, however, two nucleophilic carbons (typically C&#945; and C&#947;) potentially leading to regioisomeric products. In recent years, methods based on both metallic and organic chiral catalysts have been developed able to address some of these site&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues, enabling direct asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization of carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.

         <title>Practical Enzymatic Production of Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation pioneered by Heck in 1969 has dominated medicinal chemistry development for the ensuing fifty years. As the demand for more complex three&#8208;dimensional active pharmaceuticals continues to increase, preparative enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, by virtue of its exquisite selectivity and sustainable nature, is poised to provide a practical and affordable alternative for accessing such compounds. In this minireview, we summarize recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles. When appropriate, background information on the enzymatic transformation is provided and challenges and/or limitations are also highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salt Assisted Annealing for Making Colloidal ZnGa2O4:Cr Nanocrystals with High Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent luminescent nanocrystals (PLNCs) in sub&#8208;10 nm domain are considered most fascinating inventions in lighting technology owing to their excellent performance in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, luminous paints, bioimaging, security applications, etc.  Further improvement of persistent luminescence (PersL) intensity and lifetime is needed to achieve the desired success while keeping uniform sub&#8208;10 nm size of PLNCs.  In this work, we have introduced the concept of molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized ZnGa  2  O  4  :Cr  3+  (ZGOC) colloidal NCs (CNCs) in a molten salt media at 650  o  C for the first time. This method led to significantly monodispersed and few agglomerated NCs with much improved photoluminescence (PL) and PersL intensity without much size growth of the pristine CNCs. Other strategies, such as: (i) thermal annealing, (ii) overcoating, and (iii) core&#8208;shell strategy, have also been tried to improve PL and PersL but we could not achieve improvement in their PL and PersL simultaneously. Moreover, directly annealing of the CNCs in air without the molten salt assistance could significantly improve both PL and PersL but lead to particle heterogeneity and aggregation, which are highly unsuitable for in vivo imaging. We believe this work provides a novel strategy to design PLNCs with high PL intensity and long PersL duration without losing their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility and biocompatibility.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel Lewis acids derived from bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium dications is reported. Calculations of Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) values indicate high carbon&#8208;based Lewis acidity at the  ortho  and  para  positions. This arises in part from extensive LUMO delocalization across the aromatic backbones. Species [C  10  H  6  R  2  N  2  CH  2  CH  2  ]  2+  (R = H  [1a]  2+  , Me  [1f]  2+  ,  t  Bu  [1g]  2+  ), and [C  12  H  4  R  4  N  2  CH  2  CH  2  ]  2+  (R = H  [2a]  2+  , Me  [2b]  2+  ) were prepared and evaluated for use in the initiation of hydrodefluorination (HDF) catalysis. Compound  [2a]  2+  proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted sp  3  (C&#8208;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of  cis  &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;(CF  3  )  3  C  6  H  9  . The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C  16  H  14  N  2  (  3a  ) and C  16  H  10  Me  4  N  2  (  3b  ) and monocationic species [C  14  H  13  N  2  ]  +  (  [4a]  +  ) and [C  18  H  21  N  2  ]+ (  [4b]  +  ). Experimental and computational data provide further support that the dications are initiators in the generation of silylium cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hierarchical nanospheres were prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route, with great hydrogen evolution reaction activities. The unique plate of WS2 and the complex solid&#8208;phase structure of Fe0.95S1.05 exposes more active sites for the HER reaction, which helps to improve the accessibility and diffusibility of the electrolyte, and hence the WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalysts display favorable catalytic for HER.







Abstract
Fe0.95S1.05 with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS2 nanosheets via a one&#8208;step solvothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS2 and Fe0.95S1.05 alone, and the optimal WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. The addition of Fe0.95S1.05 was proven to be able to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS2, and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W&#8201;:&#8201;Fe=2&#8201;:&#8201;1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS2/Fe0.95S1.05&#8208;2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of &#8764;0.172&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of &#8764;53.47&#8197;mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst for HER.

         <title>Stable and Storable N(CF3)2 Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable storage solutions: Copper(I) and silver(I) complexes with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amido ligand stabilized by pyridine and phosphane ligands have become accessible. These complexes are thermally stable and can be stored under inert conditions; in contrast to the behavior of other metal salts such as M{N(CF3)2} (M=Cu, Ag). The complexes were found to be convenient reagents for nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions, thereby providing access to a series of organic substrates with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.







Abstract
Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agrochemicals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group is an example of a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, examples with the N(CF3)2 group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Herein, a set of CuI and AgI bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with unprecedented stability are presented. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoromethyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Deuteration and Hydrodeuteration: Emerging Techniques to Selectively Transform Alkenes and Alkynes to Deuterated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration techniques are emerging as powerful methods for the selective installation of deuterium into small molecules. In this minireview, recent advances for the application of these reactions in the selective deuteration of alkenes and alkynes are discussed.







Abstract
Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D2 gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes will be discussed.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Resorcin[4]arene&#8208;Based Inorganic&#8208;Organic Complexes: Metal Ion Effects on the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
New resources from resorcin: Three polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials (1&#8211;3) with different metal ions have been synthesized. Their composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO were created by anchoring 1&#8211;3 on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to enhance the conductivities. These composites show different electrochemical performances for lithium ion batteries.







Abstract
With their adjustable structures and diverse functions, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional material. They have potential applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance has rarely been investigated. Here, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;4.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;4&#8201;EtOH&#8901;13&#8201;H2O (2), and [Zn2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (3), have been synthesized. Furthermore, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8211;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to give composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 runs. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 were maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at large current density (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy: Supporting Electrolytes Are Not Always Inert</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold standards: By determining the potential of maximum entropy (PME) with the laser&#8208;induced current transient technique, the influence of the electrolyte composition on polycrystalline gold has been systematically investigated. Increasing the electrolyte pH and purging O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. The electric double&#8208;layer structure for Aupc in solutions containing Na+ and K+ ions is vastly different when electrolyte pH reaches six or higher. This method enables another approach for the interpretation of interfacial electrocatalytic processes.







Abstract
The influence of electrolyte pH, the presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and the presence of O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline gold electrodes has been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of the K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift in the PME. These findings reveal that, for example, K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond this, knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.

         <title>Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength of Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination of tellurium has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non&#8208;halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.







Abstract
Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the &#955;4Te dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O ChB distances are 2.062&#8197;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8722;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 heterotetramer with alternating &#955;4Te and &#955;2Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.

         <title>(Automated) Synthesis of Well&#8208;defined Staphylococcus Aureus Wall Teichoic Acid Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using tailor&#8208;made teichoic acid building blocks, a library of glycosylated ribitol phosphate Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acids (WTA) has been assembled, ranging in length, and varying in N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine substitution pattern. The library of well&#8208;defined WTAs has been used to develop a magnetic bead binding assay to interrogate monoclonal antibody binding, revealing the preference of the various antibodies for different glycosylation patterns.







Abstract
Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with d&#8208;alanine and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA&#8208;modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well&#8208;defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, here synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA&#8208;fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications (&#945;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for S. aureus WTAs, is reported. DNA&#8208;type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, was used to efficiently generate a library of WTA&#8208;hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA&#8208;dodecamer and glycosylated WTA&#8208;hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA&#8208;fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA&#8208;functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA&#8208;specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA&#8208;chains.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By using tailor-made teichoic acid&lt;/b&gt; building blocks, a library of glycosylated ribitol phosphate &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; wall teichoic acids (WTA) has been assembled, ranging in length, and varying in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl glucosamine substitution pattern. The library of well-defined WTAs has been used to develop a magnetic bead binding assay to interrogate monoclonal antibody binding, revealing the preference of the various antibodies for different glycosylation patterns.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-alanine and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA-modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well-defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, here synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA-fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications (&#945;-GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;-GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;-GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; WTAs, is reported. DNA-type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, was used to efficiently generate a library of WTA-hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA-dodecamer and glycosylated WTA-hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA-fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA-functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA-specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA-chains.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Easily Available, Amphiphilic Diiron Cyclopentadienyl Complexes Exhibit in Vitro Anticancer Activity in 2D and 3D Human Cancer Cells through Redox Modulation Triggered by CO Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of cationic diiron complexes containing a variable bridging iminium ligand displays promising antiproliferative activity towards a panel of 2D and 3D cancer cell lines, and a selectivity not correlated to a different degree of uptake in cancerous and noncancerous cells. The mode of action appears to be mainly related to the interference with cell redox processes (ROS production, inhibition of TrxR), initiated by intracellular CO release.







Abstract
A straightforward two&#8208;step procedure via single CO removal allows the conversion of commercial [Fe2Cp2(CO)4] into a range of amphiphilic and robust ionic complexes based on a hybrid aminocarbyne/iminium ligand, [Fe2Cp2(CO)3{CN(R)(R&#8217;)}]X (R, R&#8217;=alkyl or aryl; X=CF3SO3 or BF4), on up to multigram scales. Their physicochemical properties can be modulated by an appropriate choice of N&#8208;substituents and counteranion. Tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines, the complexes were shown to possess promising antiproliferative activity and to circumvent multidrug resistance. Interestingly, most derivatives also retained a significant cytotoxic activity against human cancer 3D cell cultures. Among them, the complex with R=4&#8208;C6H4OMe and R&#8217;=Me emerged as the best performer of the series, being on average about six times more active against cancer cells than a noncancerous cell line, and displayed IC50 values comparable to those of cisplatin in 3D cell cultures. Mechanistic studies revealed the ability of the complexes to release carbon monoxide and to act as oxidative stress inducers in cancer cells.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) on a super computer has led to a new three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) of amines, difluorocarbene, and the inexpensive and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO2. This reaction produces a broad range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine derivatives that are bioisosteres of natural glycine. The versatility of these products is very broad; i.e., they can be used as new difluorocarbene sources, substrates for radical substitution reactions, and precursors for new NHC ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Maeda, T. Mita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100812).

Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence in the red to near&#8208;infrared region were obtained by using simple naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives. This cover picture depicts the molecular assembly of the NDI&#8208;iodobenzoate complex determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, indicating that the formation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions and external heavy atom effects play an important role in the red to near&#8208;infrared luminescence.

         <dc:description>
A vapochromic luminescent crystal consisting of boron diiminate has been discovered. The emission color is changed by absorption of solvent vapor, such as dichloromethane and recovered by desorption of encapsulated molecules through fuming with another solvent vapor, such as cyclohexane. The alteration of molecular conformation between planar and twisted structures is responsible for luminochromism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem Nazarov/ene reaction in trienones was found to be initiated by tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPPB) and resulted in spiro compounds as single diastereoisomers. The reaction was applied to a set of substrates with different chain lengths and functionalities, and investigations on the mechanism were conducted. This novel diastereoselective reaction extends the application of interrupted Nazarov cyclizations as tools for the synthesis of natural products. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Kalesse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101041).

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of transient radical species are difficult to control, like the soap bubbles in the wind depicted in the cover image. Yet, these short&#8208;lived intermediates, when one encounters another, readily assemble into a united structure, as two bubbles fuse into a bigger single bubble. The enol silyl ether&#8208;derived radical cations with a highly acidic allylic proton facilitates the single&#8208;electron reduction of cyanopyridines via protonation. The resulting two radical intermediates successively engage in the radical&#8722;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Ooi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101352).

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive binding kinetics was achieved in cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;dithienylethene host&#8208;guest complexes. This work demonstrates that, in the presence of a competitor guest (in purple), the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed (green) than for the open (yellow) dithienylethene isomers (t 1/2=107 hours vs. t 1/2=1.2 hours), allowing control over the dissociation rate with red/NIR light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Jorge&#8197;Parola, N. Bas&#237;lio, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100974).

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of the activity of tyrosine kinases (TK) is an appealing topic of current research. This work presents new pseudopeptidic cages that protect the substrates from the action of the TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation, with a very good correlation between the Tyr caging and the kinase inhibition. The results illustrate how TK signaling can be efficiently and selectively modulated with supramolecular complexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;T. Miller, I. Alfonso, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100990).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a devastating neurological disease caused by a lack of the lysosomal enzyme,&#160; &#945; &#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to a toxic accumulation of heparan sulfate. Herein we explored a pharmacological chaperone approach to enhance the residual activity of NAGLU in patient fibroblasts. Capitalizing on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of two modest homoiminosugar&#8208;based NAGLU inhibitors in complex with bacterial homolog of NAGLU, CpGH89, we have synthesized a library of 17 six&#8208;membered iminosugar&#8208;  C  &#8208;glycosides mimicking&#160;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine and bearing various pseudo&#8208;anomeric substituents of both&#160; &#945; &#8208; and&#160; &#946; &#8208;configuration. Elaboration with the aglycon moiety results in low micromolar selective inhibitors of human recombinant NAGLU, but surprisingly it is the non&#8208;functionalized and wrongly configured&#160; &#946; &#8208;homoiminosugar that was proved to act as the most promising pharmacological chaperone, promoting a 2.4 fold activity enhancement of mutant NAGLU at its optimal concentration</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8211;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible addition reactions of olefins with a phosphanylalumane, P&#8211;Al single bond species, were investigated. The P&#8211;Al bond added to ethylene and relatively small terminal alkenes (propylene and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature to give the corresponding alkene&#8208;adducts. Heating of the terminal alkene&#8208;adducts released the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8211;Al bond, but no release of ethylene was observed even under vacuum conditions. The reactivity of ethylene&#8208;adduct as a new saturated C2&#8208;vicinal P/Al&#8208;based FLP was also investigated. The ethylene&#8208;adduct was found to undergo complexation with nitriles to give the corresponding nitrile adducts to the Al center, which retained the ethylene&#8208;tether as in the case of the corresponding P/B&#8208;based FLP. However, the reactivity of ethylene&#8208;adduct toward CO2 and benzaldehyde differed from that of the P/B&#8208;system giving the corresponding adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La3+ and Nd3+) in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high&#8208;purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here we explore the      competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La  3+  and Nd  3+  )     in    molten  LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LiF&#8208;LnCl  3  salts   by using electrochemical,  spectroscopic  , and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln  3+  occur when F  &#8208;  concentration increases, indicating that the F  &#8208;  anions interact with Ln  3+  via substituting the coordinated Cl  &#8208;  anions, and confirm [LnCl  x  F  y  ]  3&#8208;x&#8208;y  (y  max  =3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts.  Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl  &#8208;  and F  &#8208;  anions, which leads to the formation of  four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  ,  [LnCl  5  F]  3&#8208;  , [LnCl  4  F  2  ]  3&#8208;  and [LnCl  4  F  3  ]  4&#8208;  . Among them, the seven&#8208;coordinated [LnCl  4  F  3  ]  4&#8208;  complex possesses a low&#8208;symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, we conclude that Ln&#8208;F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F  &#8208;  ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a full account on the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Our initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle via an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or&#160; Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the&#160;  Z  &#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. We addressed those issues by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the&#160;  Z  &#8209;alkene, a&#160;  syn  &#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a&#160; &#946; &#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the &#960;&#8208;Accepting Properties of Mesoionic Carbenes: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron&#8208;donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;&#8208;accepting properties. We have performed a computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes having different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;&#8208;acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;&#8208;donor and a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor compared to an Arduengo&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, we have used the ligand to stabilize a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin(II) compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;forming peptides are of high interest for potential biomedical applications. This work presents the unexpected effects of central alkylene chains in peptides on their self&#8208;assembly and biological properties. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthening of &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, formation of hydrogels with increased stiffness, thermal responses and significant decrease in the cell adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials by conformational flexibility.

         <title>Re&#8208;entrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different temperature, different assembly: An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene showed photoinduced morphological transformation upon irradiation with UV and visible light in water. A re&#8208;entrant transformation was observed, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. Moreover, by changing the cooling temperature, different kinetic products of supramolecular assembly were obtained.







Abstract
An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced morphological transformation, that is, a photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20&#8201;&#176;C; this was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5&#8201;&#176;C gave J and H aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H aggregate with a small amount of J aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tridentate and Tetradentate Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>

The same, but different: Two phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, the tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L2), have been synthesized and studied comparatively for coordination and extraction with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Although quite different extraction properties toward AmIII and EuIII were found between L1 and L2 due to their different hydrophobicity in nitrate media, they showed comparable affinity to trivalent f&#8208;block elements, as revealed by UV/vis titration, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Two new phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for their coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1, whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol. The formation of these species was validated by fluorescence spectrometry, and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of NdIII with L1 and L2 were determined by using UV/vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)] Et2O in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent&#8208;extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both AmIII and EuIII, whereas L2 showed nearly no extraction toward AmIII or EuIII due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of the complex species formed between AmIII/EuIII and L1/L2 were analyzed in DFT calculations.

         <title>Cu/CuxS&#8208;Embedded N,S&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Derived in Situ from a MOF Designed for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greater than the sum of its parts: Cu/CuxS embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/CuxS/NSC) derived in&#8197;situ from a designed Cu&#8208;MOF was successfully synthesized. Porous Cu/CuxS/NSC has a high catalytic reduction efficiency for 4&#8208;NP (k=0.0256&#8197;s&#8722;1) and dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) that is better than that of many copper&#8208;based catalysts and even precious metal catalysts. The efficient catalytic reduction performance of Cu/CuxS/NSC is inseparable from the synergistic catalysis of each component.







Abstract
The reasonable design of the precursor of a carbon&#8208;based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5&#8208;tdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (Cu&#8208;MOF), which contains N and S atoms, in one step. Further in&#8208;situ carbonization of the Cu&#8208;MOF as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/CuxS&#8208;embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/CuxS/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/CuxS/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP) to 4&#8208;aminophenol (4&#8208;AP). The results show that the designed Cu/CuxS/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycling stability, with a reaction rate constant of 0.0256&#8197;s&#8722;1, and the conversion rate still exceeds 90&#8201;% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/CuxS/NSC catalysts were analyzed, and a possible multicomponent synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cp*Ir(III) complex bearing a pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand exhibits aromatization/dearomatization on protonation/deprotonation. The proton&#8208;responsive unit of the title compound plays a key role in catalysing &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols via a borrowing&#8208;hydrogen pathway.







Abstract
A Cp*Ir(III) complex (1) of a newly designed ligand L1 featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of 1 reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of 1 with HBF4 in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L1H)Cl]BF4 (2). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of 1 with acid is examined by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of 1 is exploited for catalyzing &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound 1 is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L2)Cl]PF6 (3) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and a short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of 1 is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone.

     alt="A Proton-Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)-Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Cp*Ir(III) complex&lt;/b&gt; bearing a pyridyl(benzamide)-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand exhibits aromatization/dearomatization on protonation/deprotonation. The proton-responsive unit of the title compound plays a key role in catalysing &#945;-alkylation of ketones and &#946;-alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols via a borrowing-hydrogen pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cp*Ir(III) complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) of a newly designed ligand L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; featuring a proton-responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with HBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H)Cl]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X-ray crystallography. The protonation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with acid is examined by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and UV-vis spectra. The proton-responsive character of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is exploited for catalyzing &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation of ketones and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen-borrowing methodology. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)Cl]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) lacking a proton-responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and a short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiate the role of the proton-responsive ligand in the hydrogen-borrowing process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unbalanced 2D Chiral Crystallization of Pentahelicene Propellers and Their Planarization into Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From helical to planar: Molecular propellers built up by three pentahelicene subunits self&#8208;assemble on a gold surface into enantiomerically unbalanced two&#8208;dimensional crystal domains. Upon thermal treatment of the close&#8208;packed monolayer, intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation into planar nanographenes occurs. Further thermal treatment leads in part to fusion into larger graphene flakes of up to four nanographene units by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.







Abstract
The chiral self&#8208;assembly of trispentahelicene propellers on a gold surface has been investigated in ultrahigh vacuum by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The trispentahelicene propellers aggregate into mirror domains with an enantiomeric ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation leads to planarization into nanographenes, which self&#8208;assemble into closed&#8208;packed layers with two different azimuths. Further treatment induces in part dimerization and trimerization by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;Containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808&#8201;is a stable and reusable catalyst for the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reduction of 17&#8208;ketosteroids to elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxysteroids compounds, as shown for the synthesis of 17&#945;&#8208;estradiol, androstan&#8208;3&#946;,17&#945;&#8208;diol, and epitestosterone. The process was carried out in a single step and without using toxic and/or expensive reagents. Temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis of estrone reduction revealed that the diastereoselectivity to 17&#945;&#8208;estradiol originates from the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities in which the Zr4+ active sites are located.







Abstract
Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, whereas most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable; it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). The kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr4+ active sites are located.

Mind the gap! Disabled scientists and students have been severely affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic; this must be urgently addressed to avoid entrenching existing inequalities. The graphical abstract includes a bar chart comparing the % disability declaration statistics for the UK population (&#8764;20% 2015&#8211;16), STEM first degree students (15.5%, 2018&#8211;19), STEM academics (3.8%, 2018&#8211;19), and UKRI grant applicants (&#8764;1%, 2014&#8211;19); and highlights the key recommendations given in the article: meaningful consultation, flexible working policies, disabled staff networks, and allyship.







Abstract
Scientists and students with disabilities have been severely affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, and this must be urgently addressed to avoid further entrenching existing inequalities. The need for rapid decision&#8208;making, often by senior colleagues without lived experience of disabilities, can lead to policies which discriminate against scientists with disabilities.
This article reflects on disability declaration statistics and research in critical disability studies and social science to explore the challenges experienced by disabled scientists before and during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and highlights recommendations and examples of good practice to adopt in order to challenge ableism in STEM communities and workplaces. It is vital that disabled staff and students are fully involved in decision making. This is particularly important as we continue to respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and plan for a post&#8208;COVID&#8208;19 future.
This time of great change can be used as an opportunity to listen, learn, and improve working conditions and access for scientists with disabilities, and by doing so, for everyone.

         <title>Using Small Molecules to Enhance P450 OleT Enzyme Activity in Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of small molecules was reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency of P450 OleT by interaction with the enzyme active center. The cover shows that the rotation motion of the turbine speeds up with the help of the small person, hinting that the efficiency of the decarboxylation catalyzed by P450 OleT was improved by the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;stimulated enzymatic reactions.

         <title>Affinity Selections of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries on Carbonic Anhydrase IX&#8208;Expressing Tumor Cells Reveal a Dependence on Ligand Valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The screening of a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells is depicted in the cover image. DNA&#8208;encoding techniques allow the construction and screening of chemical libraries of unprecedented size, but these procedures are typically performed using purified protein targets. While the introduction of cell&#8208;based selections expanded the target scope, selection parameters remained obscure.

     alt="Affinity Selections of DNA-Encoded Chemical Libraries on Carbonic Anhydrase IX-Expressing Tumor Cells Reveal a Dependence on Ligand Valence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The screening of a DNA-encoded chemical library&lt;/b&gt; against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-expressing tumor cells is depicted in the cover image. DNA-encoding techniques allow the construction and screening of chemical libraries of unprecedented size, but these procedures are typically performed using purified protein targets. While the introduction of cell-based selections expanded the target scope, selection parameters remained obscure. We report systemic optimizations which translated to the successful discovery of CAIX ligands via cell-based selections. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Scheuermann, D. Neri, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202100816"&gt;10.1002/chem.202100816&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Switching from Metal&#8208; to Ligand&#8208;Based Oxidation in Cobalt Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Bisguanidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of the redox reactivity, magnetic and optical properties of the different redox states of complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands permits their rational use in catalysis and materials science. The redox&#8208;chemistry of octahedrally&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes (three unpaired electrons) with one redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and two acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands is completely changed by replacing the acac by hexafluoro&#8208;acetylacetonato (hfacac) co&#8208;ligands. The first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered in the case of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands, giving diamagnetic Co  III  complexes. By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis&#8208;basic hfacac co&#8208;ligands, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation becomes ligand&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons).

         <title>Tracking Electrocatalytic Activity of a Single Palladium Nanoparticle for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#8217; performance is directly related to the working conditions. In general, a number of nanoparticles are uncontrollably fixed on a millimetre&#8208;sized electrode for electrochemical measurements. However, it cannot reveal the maximum electrocatalytic activity owing to the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles on the electrode surface. To amend this drawback, here, we take the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) as a model system to track the electrocatalytic activity of single Pd NPs by stochastic collision electrochemistry and ensemble electrochemistry, respectively. Comparing with the fix working condition, Pd NPs in the diffusion working condition perform a 2&#8208;5 orders magnitude enhancements of electrocatalytic activity for HER at various biased potential. Stochastic collision electrochemistry with high temporal resolution gives further insights into the accurate study of NPs&#8217; electrocatalytic performance, enabling to dramatically enhance electrocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Absorption Properties of Long Acenoacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings have received immense attention due to their performance as semiconductors in organic optoelectronic applications. Their appealing physicochemical properties, such as extended delocalization, high charge carrier mobilities, narrow HOMO&#8208;LOMO gaps and partially radical character in the ground state make them very attractive targets for many potential applications. However, the intrinsic synthetic challenges of unsubstituted members such as high reactivity and poor solubility are still limiting factors for their wider exploitation. Herein, we report a simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes with improved stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts. The synthesis and comprehensive characterization of pentacenopentacene, pentacenohexacene and hexacenohexacene, with lengths between decacene and dodecacene, are disclosed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A [Mo7O24]6&#8208; polyanion is used to catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond, although the polyanion is not directly responsible for the catalysis. The real catalyst is produced in situ of the reaction media through the decomposition of the initial polyoxometalate leading to the [Mo2O8H4] dimeric species, which is the real catalytic species. Formation in situ of this neutral compound would explain why polyanions may approach the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis. The lower mass of the real catalytic species suggests a cheaper and greener chemical process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8197;N. Miras, N.&#8197;A. Bandeira, A. Gil, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004989).

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of g&#8208;CN are systematically investigated for the first time. It is found that the luminescence properties of g&#8208;CN are determined by its band gap and two kinds of defects (CN&#8208;defect and C&#8208;defect). The results provide a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and are of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN.







Abstract
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both two kinds of defect states substantially affect the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.

It&#8242;s a matter of environment: Copolymer micelles attracted DNA oligonucleotide conjugates in aqueous solution despite lacking canonical DNA&#8208;binding motifs. Following accumulation inside micelles, DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials underwent Povarov and Biginelli reactions to target molecules by a localized sulfonic acid. The kinetics of a given reaction were tuned by the chemical environment within the micelles.







Abstract
The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reaction methodologies is a central theme to advance DNA&#8208;encoded screening library technology. Recently, we were able to show that sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymer micelles facilitated Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted reactions such as the Povarov reaction on DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials with minimal DNA degradation. Here, the impact of polymer composition on micelle shape, and reaction conversion was investigated. A dozen sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymers of different molar mass and composition were prepared by RAFT polymerization and were tested in the Povarov reaction, removal of the Boc protective group, and the Biginelli reaction. The results showed trends in the polymer structure&#8208;micellar catalytic activity relationship. For instance, micelles composed of block copolymers with shorter acrylate ester chains formed smaller particles and tended to provide faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA&#8208;oligomer&#8208;conjugates, although highly water&#8208;soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments, which is a prerequisite for carrying out a DNA&#8208;encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins (CDs) carrying ureido moieties in their peripheries were demonstrated to show unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in water, as well as strong inclusion toward guest dyes either below or above their phase transition temperatures. The coacervates of these CD derivatives further co&#8208;encapsulated a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched on and off through the phase transitions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles &#8211; ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are greatly dependent on concentration and can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ions. Significantly, the amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to host&#8208;guest binding, which affords them inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which is in contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to co&#8208;encapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe these novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8211;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new heterotrimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes were synthesized and characterized. The experimental results show that the MMCT energy and the degree of electron delocalization of isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence complexes can be tuned systematically by changing the auxiliary ligand on the bridging metal centre. The half&#8208;wave potential splitting between the terminal Fe centres in these three unoxidized complexes are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8211;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behaviour between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8722;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n (n=2, 3) (Cp=1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy, 1[PF6]n), 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy, 2[PF6]n) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy, 3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8211;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru centre from H, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order: 13+&lt;23+&lt;33+, and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order 14+&gt;34+&gt;24+. The potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centres for N[PF6]2 are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centres would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Gold is a valuable component in electronic waste, but a major barrier towards its efficient recycling is the inability to selectively dissolve gold under mild and benign conditions. In this respect, our gold dissolution research is driven by the world's megatrends, such as resource scarcity and waste management challenges. Dissolution and recycling of noble metals is in the core of a circular economy and the challenge that our topic thiol&#8208;assisted dissolution of gold aspires to solve.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Poloxometalates&#8208;based Semi&#8208;flexible Metal&#8208;semiconductor Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Low Frequency and Small Amplitude Mechanical Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have  thermal stability  problems  , which makes TENGs with semiconductors  as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO 2  modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage ( V OC  ) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K 6  P 2  Mo 18  O 62  (P 2  Mo 18  )/TiO 2  TENG device is increased by more than 4 times,  which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs.  This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.</dc:description>

Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open-circuit voltage ( V OC  ) of the optimal Ag-K 6  P 2  Mo 18  O 62  (P 2  Mo 18  )/TiO 2  TENG device is increased by more than 4 times,  which is mainly attributed to the strong electron-accepting and storage capabilities of POMs.  This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dimeric Capsules with Appended Spiropyran Units: Towards Controlled Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365 nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594; merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amine functionalized C  3  &#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein we report a detailed mechanistic study carried out upon modifying the pH, triggering the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosin A&#8208;F Aglycone via Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrovinylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their pronounced bioactivity and limited availability from natural resources, metabolites of the soft coral Pseudo&#172;pterogorgia elisabethae, such as erogorgiaene and the pseudo&#8211;pterosines, represent important target molecules for chemical synthesis. We have now developed a particularly short and efficient route towards these marine diterpenes exploiting an operationally convenient enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation as the chirogenic step. Other noteworthy C&#8208;C bond forming transformations include diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations, a Suzuki coupling and a carbonyl ene reaction. Starting from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene the anti&#8208;tubercular agent (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene (&gt;98% ee) was prepared in only 7 steps with 46% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis of the pseudopterosin A aglycone was achieved in 12 steps with 30% overall yield and, surprisingly, was found to exhibit a similar anti&#8208;inflammatory activity (inhibition of LPS&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation) as a natural mixture of pseudopterosins A&#8208;D or iso&#8208;pseudopterosin A, prepared by &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;xylosylation of the synthetic aglycone</dc:description>

         <title>Ready access to anhydrous anionic lanthanide acetates using imidazolium acetate ionic liquids as the reaction medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. We developed a straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by reaction of lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C  2  mim][OAc]). This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C  2  mim]  n  [{Ln  2  (OAc)  7  }  n  ] and the dimeric [C  2  mim]  2  [Ln  2  (OAc)  8  ], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used. A reaction with an IL:Ln&#8208;salt ratio of 5:1 where Ln = Nd, Sm, and Gd led exclusively to the polymeric, whilst for the heaviest lanthanides (Dy&#8208;Lu) dimeric was observed. Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. By increasing the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series. Crystallographic analyses of the resulting salts revealed three different types of metal&#8208;acetate coordination modes where  &#951;  2  &#956;&#954;  2  is the most represented both structure types.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethoxylated (hetero)arenes are of great interest for several disciplines, especially in agro&#8208; and medicinal chemistry. Radical C&#8208;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes represents an attractive approach to prepare such compounds but the high cost and low atom economy of existing &#8226;OCF 3 radical sources makes them unsuitable for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated building blocks. Herein, we introduce bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP, CF 3 OOCF 3 ) as a practical and efficient trifluoromethoxylating reagent that is easily accessible from inexpensive bulk chemicals. Using either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis, trifluoromethoxylated arenes could be prepared in good yields under mild conditions directly from unactivated aromatics. Moreover, TEMPO catalysis allowed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable pyridine derivatives, which have been previously prepared via multi&#8208;step approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole (  1  ) (i.e. ArP, where Ar = 2&#8208;(DippN=CH)C  6  H  4  , Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) showed a spectacular reactivity behaving both as a reactive heterodiene in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions or as a hidden phosphinidene in the coordination toward selected transition metals (TMs). Thus,  1  reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R = CO  2  Me, C  5  F  4  N) giving 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;iminonaphthalenes  2  and  3  , that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes  4  and  5  . Compound  1  is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected  N  &#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)  2  (R = Me,  t  Bu, Ph) resulting in the addition products  7  &#8208;  9  with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to  1  is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when  1  was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4  e  donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [  &#956;  &#8208;ArP(AuCl)  2  ] (  10  ), [(  &#956;  &#8208;ArP)  4  Ag  4  ][X]  4  (X = BF  4  (  11  ), OTf (  12  )) and [  &#956;  &#8208;ArP(Co  2  (CO)  6  )] (  13  ).

Thus,  1  reacts with electron-deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R = CO  2  Me, C  5  F  4  N) giving 1-phospha-1,4-dihydro-iminonaphthalenes  2  and  3  , that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1-phosphanaphthalenes  4  and  5  . Compound  1  is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected  N  -alkyl/aryl-maleimides RN(C(O)CH)  2  (R = Me,  t  Bu, Ph) resulting in the addition products  7  -  9  with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to  1  is semi-reversible upon heating. By contrast, when  1  was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4  e  donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [  &#956;  -ArP(AuCl)  2  ] (  10  ), [(  &#956;  -ArP)  4  Ag  4  ][X]  4  (X = BF  4  (  11  ), OTf (  12  )) and [  &#956;  -ArP(Co  2  (CO)  6  )] (  13  ). The structure and electron distribution of the starting material  1  as well as of other compounds were also studied from the theoretical point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitch triads comprised of two dihydroazulene (DHA) units in conjugation to a central  trans&#8208;  azobenzene (AZB) unit were prepared in stepwise protocols starting from  meta  &#8208; and  para  &#8208;disubstituted azobenzenes. The  para  &#8208;connected triad had significantly altered optical properties and lacked the photoactivity of the separate photochromes. Instead, for the  meta  &#8208;connected triad all three photochromes could be photoisomerized to generate an isomer with two vinylheptafulvene (VHF) units and a  cis&#8208;  azobenzene unit.

This  meta  triad underwent thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;conversions with a similar rate of all VHFs, independent of the identity of the neighboring units, and in parallel thermal  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  AZB conversion.

         <title>Contributions of Internal Atoms of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters to Catalytic Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties. However, it is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) of a catalyst can dominantly contribute to its catalytic performance, because the observed performance usually reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address the above central issues, since the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved and hence very fundamental understanding of nanocatalysis can be attained at an atomic level. This review focuses on recent efforts to reveal the contributions of the internal atoms or vacancies of the nanocluster catalysts to the catalytic processes, including that the catalytic activity can be dramatically changed by the central doping of a foreign atom; the catalytic activation and inactivation can be reversibly switched by shuttling the central atom into and out of nanoclusters; the evolution in catalytic activity can be driven by structural periodicity in the inner kernels of the nanoclusters. We anticipate that the progress in this research area could represent a novel conceptual framework for understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of the catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Dehydroisomerization Boosts n&#8208;Butane Dehydrogenation with High Butadiene Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Butadiene (BD) is a critical raw material in chemical industry, which is conventionally produced from naphtha cracking. The fast&#8208;growing demand of BD and the limited oil reserve motivate chemists to develop alternative methods for BD production. Shale gas, which mainly consists of light alkanes, has been considered as cheap raw materials to replace oil for BD production via  n  &#8208;butane direct dehydrogenation (  n  &#8208;BDH). However, the quest for highly&#8208;efficient catalysts for  n  &#8208;BDH is driven by the current drawback of low BD selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for boosting the selectivity of BD by suppressing dehydroisomerization, an inevitable step in the conventional  n  &#8208;BDH process which largely reduces the selectivity of BD. Detailed investigations show that the addition of alkali&#8208;earth metals (e.g., Mg and Ca) into Pt&#8208;Ga  2  O  3  /S10 catalysts increases Pt dispersity, suppresses coke deposition and dehydroisomerization, and thus leads to the significant increase of BD selectivity. The optimized catalyst displays an initial BD selectivity of 34.7% at a  n  &#8208;butane conversion of 82.1% at 625  o  C, which outperforms the reported catalysts in literatures. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for BD production via  n  &#8208;BDH, but also promotes the researches on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with a parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G&#8208;quadruplex, refolding into a novel (3+1) hybrid topology with a propeller&#8208;propeller&#8208;lateral loop architecture and an all&#8208;syn 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal G&#8208;tract is reported. Although supported by additional stacking of a lateral duplex hairpin onto an outer G&#8208;tetrad, the structural rearrangement must be enforced through the specific incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring 8&#8208;bromoguanosine analogues into the terminal G&#8208;run.







Abstract
Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop. The resulting (3+1) hybrid fold features three syn&#8901;anti&#8901;anti&#8901;anti G&#8208;tetrads with a 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal all&#8208;syn G&#8208;column. Although the ability of forming a duplex stem&#8208;loop between G&#8208;tracts seems beneficial for a propeller&#8208;to&#8208;lateral loop rearrangement, unmodified G&#8208;rich sequences resist folding into the new (3+1) topology. However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring guanosine analogues into positions of the fourth G&#8208;stretch. The presented hybrid&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure as determined by NMR spectroscopy may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII Complexes: Ion&#8208;Pairing &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems with Various Anion&#8208;Binding Modes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes, as phosphorescence&#8208;emitting and anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic systems with planar geometries, were synthesized to construct ion&#8208;pairing assemblies in the form of anion complexes. The ordered arrangements of the anion complexes and countercations, including porphyrin AuIII complexes, were formed via noncovalent interactions between oppositely and identically charged species in the solid state.







Abstract
A variety of &#960;&#8208;electronic ion&#8208;pairing assemblies can be constructed by combining anion complexes of &#960;&#8208;electronic systems and countercations. In this study, a series of anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic molecules, dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes containing a phenylpyridine ligand, were synthesized. The resulting PtII complexes exhibited phosphorescence emission, with higher emission quantum yields (0.30&#8211;0.42) and microsecond&#8208;order lifetimes, and solution&#8208;state anion binding, as revealed by our spectroscopic analyses. These PtII complexes displayed solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion&#8208;binding modes, which derived from pyrrole&#8208;inverted and pyrrole&#8208;non&#8208;inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assemblies, which were dependent on the substituents in the PtII complexes and the geometries and electronic states of their countercations.

         <title>Enantioselective Protonation of Cyclic Carbonyl Ylides by Chiral Lewis Acid Assisted Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective protonation of cyclic carbonyl ylides by chiral Lewis acid assisted alcohol addition reactions featuring a dual catalytic system is reported. The unique heterobicyclic products bearing a quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center were obtained with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Computational mechanistic studies indicated that a stepwise syn&#8208;addition of alcohols under the influence of a Lewis acid was favored.







Abstract
Chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alcohol addition reactions to cyclic carbonyl ylides generated from N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones featuring a dual catalytic system are reported. Construction of a chiral quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center was accomplished in which the unique heterobicycles were obtained in good yields with high stereoselection. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations revealed that alcohols could be activated by Lewis acids, enabling enantioselective protonation of the carbonyl ylides.

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new N&#8208;heterocyclic alkynyl hypervalent iodine reagents have been synthesized. Their structures and reactivity are described and compared to already reported cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents, showing less extended &#963; holes for tosylated reagents. Good alkyne transfer properties towards strong nucleophiles were observed, but applications in radical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes were more limited.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, the synthesis of new N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds is reported. Solid&#8208;state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8722;Calkyne bond lengths allowed assessing the trans&#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the O&#8208;based EBX reagents.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Ternary Indium/Tin/Aluminum Oxide Thin Films, Their Characterization and Transistor Performance under Illumination.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary metal oxide semiconducting multilayer structure of composition [In2O3//SnO2//Al2O3] is accessible by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach. Oxygen deficiency in these ALD derived thin films can be effectively manipulated and controlled by adding a distinct number of alumina monolayers. Besides its semiconducting behavior, the incorporation of the alumina monolayers alters the light stability of the semiconducting multilayer thin film in a thin film transistor device under illumination in the radiation range between 300&#8211;600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In2O3, SnO2, and Al2O3 were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#8201;&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors. After post&#8208;deposition annealing at 400&#8201;&#176;C the thin&#8208;films are found to be amorphous, however, they show a discrete layer structure of the individual oxides of uniform film thickness and high optical transparency in the visible region. Incorporation of only two monolayers of Al2O3 in the active semiconducting layer the formation of oxygen vacancies can be effectively suppressed, resulting in an improved semiconducting and switching behavior. The heterostacks comprising of In2O3/SnO2/Al2O3 are incorporated into TFT devices, exhibiting a saturation field&#8208;effect mobility (&#956;sat) of 2.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a threshold&#8208;voltage (Vth) of 8.6&#8197;V, a high current on/off ratio (IOn/IOff) of 1.0&#215;107, and a subthreshold swing (SS) of 485&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The stability of the TFT under illumination is also altered to a significant extent. A change in the transfer characteristic towards conductive behavior is evident when illuminated with light of an energy of 3.1&#8197;eV (400&#8197;nm).

New wheels for cycloisomerizations: We report the synthesis of novel trinuclear triphosphine&#8208;gold(I)&#8208;calix[6]arene complexes A and B. These multitasking supramolecular wheels, which could be employed as a platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxanes species, displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective cycloisomerizations of 1,6&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of novel triphosphine calix[6]arene ligands. These supramolecular wheels, with recognition features governed by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding domain, were employed to synthesize multitasking trinuclear gold(I) complexes as a new platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxane species. In parallel, the multivalent, metal&#8208;bonded upper rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azoles through Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals play revolutionary role in achieving regioselective and chemodivergent C&#8722;H activation attaining step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy. Introducing synthetically manipulative functional groups to omnipresent backbone 1,3&#8208;(benz)azoles has never been easier with this diverse set of metal catalysts and tailored ligands. This review article presents a collective summary of all metal catalysts used to rapidly extend the synthetic library of azoles.







Abstract
The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;Azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalization have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird&#8216;s eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalization of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15&#8197;years.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transition metals&lt;/b&gt; play revolutionary role in achieving regioselective and chemodivergent C&#8722;H activation attaining step- and atom-economy. Introducing synthetically manipulative functional groups to omnipresent backbone 1,3-(benz)azoles has never been easier with this diverse set of metal catalysts and tailored ligands. This review article presents a collective summary of all metal catalysts used to rapidly extend the synthetic library of azoles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeletal presence of 1,3-azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross-coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3-Azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth-abundant transition metals. Lately, C-2 functionalization have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird&#8216;s eye view of all major C-2 functionalization of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15&#8197;years.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the detailed mechanism behind directional rotation of light driven molecular motors is a necessary prerequisite for the conscious design of their properties. In this work the influence of sterical hindrance on the speed of helix inversion in hemithioindigo&#8208;based molecular motors is elucidated. Unexpectedly, increasing steric hindrance at two different positions on the rotor fragment is found to have opposite effects: at the aliphatic position helix inversion is accelerated while at the aromatic position this process is slowed down.







Abstract
Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and an in&#8197;situ irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Oxazolomycins B and C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis confirms structures: The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C was achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yield, respectively. The completion of the total synthesis showed that the hypothesized structures of the natural products are correct.







Abstract
Efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin are reported. The syntheses were achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yields, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner's Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.

         <title>Solvato Modulation of the Magnetic Memory in Isotopically Enriched Erbium Polyoxometalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is not based on solvent crystallization molecules but hydrated polyoxometalate(POM)&#8211;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35H2O and its dehydrated form relax differently. Experimental and theoretical investigations evidence that the stability of the edifice depends on labile water molecules. Furthermore, isotopic enrichment at ErIII site shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.







Abstract
Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is by essence molecular, while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid&#8208;state properties. The solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometalate(POM)&#8208;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35&#8201;H2O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state, while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (166Er, I=0) ErIII ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Phosphates: Solvent&#8208;Controlled Growth and Stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is a key nanobiomaterial where shape, size and phase purity remain as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids by using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine. The solvent mixture can be used as a new green tool to control the size (from 60 nm to &gt;500 nm) and the internal mesostructured (fractal dimension).







Abstract
Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials in key biomedical applications, such as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the preparation of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. In this work, the epoxide route was adapted for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids. By using biocompatible solvents, such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine, it was possible to avoid the natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60&#8197;nm) to micrometric spheroids (&gt;500&#8197;nm). The eventual fractalization of the internal mesostructured can be tuned, by simply adjusting the composition of the ethylene glycol:glycerine solvent mixture. These findings introduce the use of green solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as Nano&#8208;Octopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbazolic derivatives are reported to associate with fullerenes as a novel host class. Different amounts of carbazole units and tunable bridged linker modulated the binding strength and its alternated arrangement pattern. Benefit from the continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 short&#8208;contact channels, promising electron&#8208;transport and photovoltaic effects are achieved in the host&#8208;guest complex devices.







Abstract
Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, three novel carbazolic derivatives, containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes, are rationally designed. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when a continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 interaction channel existed. The results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of carbazolic derivatives&lt;/b&gt; are reported to associate with fullerenes as a novel host class. Different amounts of carbazole units and tunable bridged linker modulated the binding strength and its alternated arrangement pattern. Benefit from the continuous C&lt;sub&gt;60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; short-contact channels, promising electron-transport and photovoltaic effects are achieved in the host-guest complex devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fullerene host-guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular-level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, three novel carbazolic derivatives, containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes, are rationally designed. Unlike the general concave-convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2-dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron-transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when a continuous C&lt;sub&gt;60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interaction channel existed. The results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide new insights into novel fullerene host-guest architectures for versatile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a new class of miRNA probes with photo&#8208;active trioxsalen attached via oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. These cross&#8208;link to RNA targets in&#8197;vitro with efficiencies dependent on sequence and linker&#8208;length. By using controlled mixtures of probes, a general approach to efficient covalent target&#8208;capture independent of miRNAs sequence is proposed.







Abstract
MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs that influence various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes. Their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which a trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the N4&#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. In vitro photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, demonstrating a general applicability of the presented approach.

         <title>A Showcase of Green Chemistry: Sustainable Synthetic Approach of Zirconium&#8208;Based MOF Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production and application of Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials are restricted by numerous factors. By embracing green chemistry, green raw materials and green synthesis methods are the keys in sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over last decade. This review summarizes the achievements and looks forward to the future industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8722;MOFs.







Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8722;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark porous materials and even many other MOFs due to the excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact. Based on the principles of &#8220;Green Chemistry&#8221;, considerable efforts have been done for breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over the past decade. In this review, the advancements of green raw materials and green synthesis methods in the synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs are reviewed, along with the corresponding drawbacks. The challenges and prospects are discussed and outlooked, expecting to provide guidance for the acceleration of the industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8722;MOFs.

         <title>Diindenopyrazines: Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron poor, but rich in possibility: Electron&#8208;deficient diindenopyrazines with different aryl substituents have been synthesized and characterized. The introduction of electron&#8208;poor aryl groups reduces the electron affinity to &#8722;4&#8197;eV, thereby making the compounds attractive as n&#8208;semiconductors. Tested in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor, compound 4&#8201;e showed electron mobilities up to 0.037&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
The syntheses, properties and application of the air&#8208;stable electron acceptors, diindenopyrazines 4&#8201;a&#8211;g are reported demonstrating the introduction of functional aryl groups in the 6&#8208; and 12&#8208;positions. The targets are accessible on the hundred milligram to gram scale. The structure of the aryl groups in 4&#8201;a&#8211;g modulates their solubility, redox potentials and optical properties. The introduction of electron&#8208;poor aryl groups to the electron&#8208;poor diindenopyrazine backbone reduces the electron affinity to &#8722;4&#8197;eV, making the compounds attractive as n&#8208;semiconductors. A simple organic field&#8208;effect transistor of 4&#8201;e &#8211;without optimization&#8211; shows electron transport with a mobility of up to 0.037&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Heptacene: Synthesis and Its Hole&#8208;Transfer Property in Stable Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge carrier&#8208;bagged: Heptacene has been synthesized in nine steps in a total yield of 10&#8201;%, and its hole&#8208;transfer properties have been measured by fabricating organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. The best hole mobility performance was 2.2&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a stable thin film of heptacene. The potential use of heptacene as an effective charge carrier is reported for the first time.







Abstract
Heptacene (1) has been produced via a monoketone precursor, 2, which was prepared from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene in nine steps in a total yield of 10&#8201;%. Compound 2 was converted to 1 quantitatively by heating at 202&#8201;&#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without any observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of 1 as a material for p&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum deposition of 1 onto a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO2/Si substrate. The best hole mobility performance was 2.2&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This is the first report of stable heptacene being used in an effective device and examined for its charge carrier properties.

Guide for designing photosensitizers: The effect of the topololgy of porphyrinic zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks on 1O2 generation and photodynamic antibacterial performance was studied in four model MOFs. The number of porphyrin (TCPP) molecules per Zr6O8 cluster, the pore size and the distance between inter&#8208;TCPP active sites, which are caused by variations in the MOF&#8242;s topology, play important roles in 1O2 generation.Thus, this work provides guidance for designing new MOFs as photosensitizers in photodynamic sterilization and therapy.







Abstract
Porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising photosensitizers due to the lack of self&#8208;aggregation of porphyrin in aqueous solution. However, how the topology of porphyrinic MOFs affects the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) is unclear. Here, the effect of the topology of porphyrinic MOFs on their photodynamic performance is reported. Four porphyrinic zirconium MOFs (MOF&#8208;525, MOF&#8208;545, PCN&#8208;223 and PCN&#8208;224 with different topologies: ftw, csq, shp and she, respectively) were selected to study the influence of topology on the photodynamic antibacterial performance. The 1O2 generation and the photodynamic antibacterial performance followed an decreasing order of MOF&#8208;545&gt;MOF&#8208;525&gt;PCN&#8208;224&gt;PCN&#8208;223. The results reveal that the pore size, the distance between porphyrin, and the number of porphyrin per Zr6O8 cluster in MOFs greatly affected 1O2 generation. This work provides guidance for designing new MOFs for efficient photodynamic sterilization.

         <title>What is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The QM/MM calculations of the demethylation of symmetrical dimethylated arginine (R3me2&#8197;s) substrate by KDM4E via C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H pathways show the preference for the former and application of external electric fields (EEFs) increases the rate of C&#8722;H activation, while inhibiting the rate of N&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Arginine methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Some Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent Jumonji&#8208;C (JmjC) N&#1013;&#8208;methyl lysine histone demethylases also have N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylase activity. We report combined molecular dynamic (MD) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) studies on the mechanism of N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation by human KDM4E and compare the results with those reported for N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation by KDM4A. At the KDM4E active site, Glu191, Asn291, and Ser197 form a conserved scaffold that restricts substrate dynamics; substrate binding is also mediated by an out of active site hydrogen&#8208;bond between the substrate Ser1 and Tyr178. The calculations imply that in either C&#8722;H or N&#8722;H potential bond cleaving pathways for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation, electron transfer occurs via a &#963;&#8208;channel; the transition state for the N&#8722;H pathway is &#8764;10&#8197;kcal/mol higher than for the C&#8722;H pathway due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the N&#8722;H bond. The results of applying external electric fields (EEFs) reveal EEFs with positive field strengths parallel to the Fe=O bond have a significant barrier&#8208;lowering effect on the C&#8722;H pathway, by contrast, such EEFs inhibit the N&#8722;H activation rate. The overall results imply that KDM4 catalyzed N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation and N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation occur via similar C&#8722;H abstraction and rebound mechanisms leading to methyl group hydroxylation, though there are differences in the interactions leading to productive binding of intermediates.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Effect of Fluorine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Site Catalyst in the Ethylene Dimerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive and detailed computational study of the ethylene dimerization reaction mechanism on the inorganic building unit on Pd&#8208;single site MOF heterogeneous catalysts was carried out. The origins of the catalytic performance of bis&#8208;triazolate ligand with biphenyl organic backbone and its fluorinated counterpart were elucidated. This represents the first example of using computational analysis to uncover the palladium&#8208;MOF catalyst&#8242;s reactivity and the ligand fluorine effect for ethylene dimerization reaction.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization reaction is one of the most common mechanisms for the production of 1&#8208;butene. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive attention in this area since they combine all the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in a single compound. Here a computational mechanistic study of MOF&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;site catalyst for ethylene dimerization reaction is reported. Catalytic systems with both biphenyl&#8208;type backbone as organic ligand and its fluorine&#8208;functionalization have been investigated to reveal the origin of ligand effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculations revealed that the nonfluorinated palladium MOF catalyst undergoes dimerization over isomerization reaction. Then the influence of the fluorine&#8208;functionalized organic ligand was compared in the dimerization catalytic cycle, which was strongly favored in terms of activity and selectivity. Catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions were analyzed by energy decomposition analysis revealing the critical role of ligand backbone functionalization on the activity. This theoretical analysis identified three chemically meaningful dominant effects on these catalysts; steric, electrostatic and charge transfer effects. The steric effects promote nonfluorinated MOF catalyst, whereas the electrostatic effects are the dominant factor that promotes its fluorinated counterpart. This theoretical study provides feedback with future experimental studies about the role of fluorine ligand functionalization in palladium MOF catalysts for ethylene dimerization reaction.

         <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;Dimethylallene with N&#8208;Methylaniline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses of the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;dimethylallene with N&#8208;methylaniline support a mechanism involving rapid and reversible addition of N&#8208;methylaniline to the more substituted terminus of gold &#960;&#8208;allene complex I to form gold vinyl complex II superimposed on slower addition of N&#8208;methylaniline to the less substituted terminus of I to form gold vinyl complex III. Selective formation of the linear allylic amine 3&#8201;a is attributed to the more facile protodeauration of III relative to II.







Abstract
The mechanism of the intermolecular hydroamination of 3&#8208;methylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene (1) with N&#8208;methylaniline (2) catalyzed by (IPr)AuOTf has been studied by employing a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labelling studies, and in&#8197;situ spectral analysis of catalytically active mixtures. The results of these and additional experiments are consistent with a mechanism for hydroamination involving reversible, endergonic displacement of N&#8208;methylaniline from [(IPr)Au(NHMePh)]+ (4) by allene to form the cationic gold &#960;&#8208;C1,C2&#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;2&#8208;H2C=C=CMe2)]+ (I), which is in rapid, endergonic equilibrium with the regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;C2,C3&#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;2&#8208;Me2C=C=CH2)]+ (I&#8242;). Rapid and reversible outer&#8208;sphere addition of 2 to the terminal allene carbon atom of I&#8242; to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CH2)CMe2NMePh] (II) is superimposed on the slower addition of 2 to the terminal allene carbon atom of I to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CMe2)CH2NMePh] (III). Selective protodeauration of III releases N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)aniline (3&#8201;a) with regeneration of 4. At high conversion, gold vinyl complex II is competitively trapped by an (IPr)Au+ fragment to form the cationic bis(gold) vinyl complex {[(IPr)Au]2[C(=CH2)CMe2NMePh]}+ (6).

         <title>Enantioconvergent Substitution Reactions of Racemic Electrophiles by Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts is a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form. This minireview highlights recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.







Abstract
Over the past decades, the development of enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts has evolved into an active research field and a number of enantioselective transformations have been established. However, despite their being a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form, the enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts still present several challenges. Although intrinsic difficulties in the catalytic stereocontrol abound due to the initial chiral information of racemic electrophiles, in recent years, mechanistically diverse enantioconvergent processes have been intensively investigated in organocatalysis. This Minireview focuses on recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt Molybdate Hollow Rods Induced by Structure and Defect Engineering as Exceptional Electrode Materials for Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8337-8343, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects are engineered and prepared through a facile soft&#8208;template combined with partial reduction methods. The electrode material shows exceptional specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention of the D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 is about 95.8&#8201;% along with the cycle number of 3000. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC exhibits an exceptional energy density (34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4) through a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4&#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000&#8197;cycles. D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudocapacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.

         <title>A Novel M8L6 Cubic Cage That Binds Tetrapyridyl Porphyrins: Cage and Solvent Effects in Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8390-8397, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and application of a novel caged cobalt porphyrin catalyst is reported. The effects of the solvent and/or the cage on the catalytic performance in cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions were investigated for the free and confined catalyst. Encapsulation of the catalyst led to a three times more active catalyst compared to the well&#8208;established cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin and leads to a substantially increased TON.







Abstract
Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post&#8208;functionalization. This is a rare example of a metal&#8208;coordination cage able to bind catalytically active porphyrins that is soluble in solvents spanning a wide variety of polarity. This system was used to investigate the combined effects of the solvent and the cage on the catalytic performance in the cobalt catalyzed cyclopropanation of styrene, which involves radical intermediates. Kinetic studies show that DMF has a protective influence on the catalyst, slowing down deactivation of both [Co(TPP)] and Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, leading to higher TONs in this solvent. Moreover, DFT studies on the [Co(TPP)] catalyst show that the rate determining energy barrier of this radical&#8208;type transformation is not influenced by the coordination of DMF. As such, the increased TONs obtained experimentally stem from the stabilizing effect of DMF and are not due to an intrinsic higher activity caused by axial ligand binding to the cobalt center ([Co(TPP)(L)]). Remarkably, encapsulation of Co&#8722;G led to a three times more active catalyst than [Co(TPP)] (TOFini) and a substantially increased TON compared to both [Co(TPP)] and free Co&#8722;G. The increased local concentration of the substrates in the hydrophobic cage compared to the bulk explains the observed higher catalytic activities.

         <title>Fulvalene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Ladder&#8208;Type Structures: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8315-8324, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiredox systems: Ladder&#8208;type structures can be obtained by connecting indenofluorene units via cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene motifs. Placing such polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons between two dithiafulvenes provides multiredox systems that undergo reversible reductions and oxidations and that can hence exist in several charge states. Synthetic protocols for such &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes are presented together with redox, optical, and structural properties.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have found strong interest for their electronic properties and as model systems for graphene. While PAHs have been studied intensively as single units, here PAHs were constructed in ladder&#8208;type arrangements using cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene and dithiafulvalene motifs as connecting units and moving forward a convenient synthetic approach for dimerizing (thio)ketones into olefins by the action of Lawesson's reagent. Some of the PAHs can also be regarded as &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with some of the largest cores ever explored, being multi&#8208;redox systems that exhibit both reversible oxidations and reductions. Concomitant absorption redshifts were observed when expanding the ladder&#8208;type structures from one to two to three indenofluorene units, and optical and electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps were found to correlate linearly. Various conformations (and solid&#8208;state packing arrangements) were studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computations.

The synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;modified cytidine phosphoramidite and oligodeoxynucleotides containing this modification is presented. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of a 450&#8197;nm blue light was investigated in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The control of DNA synthesis in&#8197;vitro was achieved by using the blue light in the primer extension reactions in the presence of DNA polymerases.







Abstract
A new family of hydrazone modified cytidine phosphoramidite building block was synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to construct photoswitchable DNA strands. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450&#8197;nm was investigated and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The light activated Z form isomer of this hydrazone&#8208;cytidine with a six&#8208;member intramolecular hydrogen bond was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in the primer extension model by using Bst DNA polymerase. In addition, the hydrazone modification caused the misincorporation of dATP together with dGTP into the growing DNA strand with similar selectivity, highlighting a potential G to A mutation. This work provides a novel functional DNA building block and an additional molecular tool that has potential chemical biology and biomedicinal applications to control DNA synthesis and DNA&#8208;enzyme interactions using the cell friendly blue light irradiation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8308-8314, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable copper(I) coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) are self&#8208;assembled in water and they display solvent composition&#8208;responsive behavior that can be followed by emission of the aggregates. The dramatic differences in the emission energy and the morphology of the aggregates have been attributed to changes in the coordination sphere around the copper centers.







Abstract
Luminescent copper(I)&#8208;based compounds have recently attracted much attention since they can reach very high emission quantum yields. Interestingly, Cu(I) clusters can also be emissive, and the extension from small molecules to larger architecture could represent the first step towards novel materials that could be obtained by programming the units to undergo self&#8208;assembly. However, for Cu(I) compounds the formation of supramolecular systems is challenging due to the coordinative diversity of copper centers. This works shows that this diversity can be exploited in the construction of responsive systems. In detail, the changes in the emissive profile of different aggregates formed in water by phosphine&#8208;thioether copper(I) derivatives were followed. Our results demonstrate that the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of Cu(I)&#8208;based coordination polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) is sensitive to solvent composition. The solvent&#8208;induced changes are related to modifications in the coordination sphere of copper at the molecular level, which alters not only the emission profile but also the morphology of the aggregates. Our findings are expected to inspire the construction of smart supramolecular systems based on dynamic coordinative metal centers.

         <title>Solvent Induced Helix Folding of Defined Indolenine Squaraine Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8380-8389, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defined indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer were synthesised via iterative cross coupling. Depending on the solvent either a random coil (J&#8208;type) or a loose helix (H&#8208;type) is formed. Structural and folding properties were examined via optical spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, SANS and computations.







Abstract
A protecting group strategy was employed to synthesise a series of indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer. The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.

         <title>Effect of Ligand Polarity on the Internal Dipoles and Ferroelectric Distortion in BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>

Surface of BaTiO3 nanocubes covered with nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) capping ligands, derived from atomistic modelling of neutron PDF data.







Abstract
Surface adsorbates and surrounding matrix species have been demonstrated to affect the properties of nanoscale ferroelectrics and nanoscale ferroelectric composites; potentially counteracting performance losses that can occur in small particle sizes. In this work, the effects of nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ligand capping on the surface of various sizes of BaTiO3 nanocubes have been investigated with combined neutron diffraction and neutron pair distribution function (PDF), density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. The low real space PDF region provides an unobstructed view of rhombohedral (split short and long) Ti&#8722;O distances in BaTiO3 nanocubes, mimicking the well&#8208;established order&#8208;disorder local structure found in bulk BaTiO3. Interestingly, the intermediate&#8208;range order in nanocubes is found to be orthorhombic, rather than tetragonal. It is concluded that polar ligands adsorbed at BaTiO3 surfaces stabilize the correlation length scale of local rhombohedral distortions in ferroelectric nanoparticles relative to nonpolar ligands.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;Fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>

An indium&#8208;catalyzed system was developed that transforms the C&#8722;F bond of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluoroethenyl)benzoate derivatives via an oxymetalation process using an indium catalyst to produce various fluorinated isocoumarins. The reactions proceeded under mild conditions without transition metals.







Abstract
Fluorinated heterocycles have attracted much attention in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the synthesis of fluorinated heterocycles. Formidable challenges remain, however, in the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarin derivatives that are among the most alluring structural motifs. Herein, the indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond transformation of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl) benzoates is reported, which are readily accessible compounds, to give a diverse array of fluorinated isocoumarins. The present reaction proceeds smoothly using inexpensive reagents: a catalytic amount of indium salt in the presence of zinc salt. A theoretical calculation of potential energy profiles showed that the reaction consists of oxymetalation with the elimination of alkyl halide and the &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination.

         <title>Binding of a TlCl Entity by a Tetragold Tetramercaptothiacalixarene Metalloligand via Metallophilic Interactions</title>

p&#8208;tert&#8208;Butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene was used as a coordination platform to synthesize and investigate gold(I) complexes with varying nuclearity. Aiming at the corresponding tetranuclear complex through salt metathesis it was found capable of binding a neutral, molecular TlCl entity by metallophilic interactions, as shown by structural and theoretical investigations. These Interactions lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures (see figure).







Abstract
The successive auration of p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene, H4(MTC[4]), with gold(I) phosphine units was investigated. Through deprotonation with NaOMe, followed by salt metathesis reactions with (PR3)AuCl (R=Me, Ph) complexes with two and three [(PR3)Au]+ moieties could be prepared and isolated, namely [(Ph3PAu)2H2(MTC[4])] and [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])]. In [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])] two gold atoms already come close enough to undergo aurophilic interactions. To introduce a fourth [(PR3)Au]+ entity TlOEt had to be used for the deprotonation, which led to the finding that four gold atoms organised by the (MTC[4])4&#8722; coordination platform are able to bind and stabilize a TlCl entity, yielding [(Me3PAu)4TlCl(MTC[4])]. As evidenced by structural and theoretical investigations the binding occurs through strong metallophilic interactions, which lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures.

         <title>Crystal Engineering Using Polyiodide Halogen and Chalcogen Bonding to Isolate the Phenothiazinium Radical Cation and Its Rare Dimer, 10&#8208;(3&#8208;Phenothiazinylidene)phenothiazinium</title>

By diiodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine in a variety of solvents, the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation, along with its radical coupling product, 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinylidene)phenothiazinium, have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the latter for the first time. Several examples of each species are presented, supported by an array of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Utilizing facile one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine by molecular diiodine, the solid&#8208;state structure of the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation was obtained in three cation:iodide ratios, as well as its THF and acetone solvates. Oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine with molecular diiodine in DMSO or DMF provided the structure of the radical coupling product 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinyldene)phenothiazinium, which has not been crystallographically characterized to date. The radical cations were balanced by a mixture (I7)&#8722;, (I5)&#8722;, (I3)&#8722;, and I&#8722; anions, where a variety of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize the structures to reveal these interesting cationic species.

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8358-8364, June 4, 2021. </description>

Treatment of racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;AgI3RhIII2 complex cations with racemic RR/SS&#8208;tartrate gave a single conglomerate containing a pair of enantiomers &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS and &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR on crystallization. While similar treatment using racemic R/S&#8208;malate also gave a single conglomerate, the enantiomers produced have opposite chiralities of &#923;&#923;&#8208;S and &#916;&#916;&#8208;R. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the S form of natural malate, which is opposite to the RR form of natural tartrate. The presence of S&#8208;aspartate led to preferential crystallization of one enantiomer &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS or &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR dependent on the solution pH.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur's work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, a unique example of this phenomenon is reported, involving ionic crystals generated from racemic RR/SS&#8208; tartrate or R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+ (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. RR&#8208; and SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916; isomers of [1]3+ to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3, respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using R/S&#8208;malate, R&#8208; and S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+ to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3 and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3, respectively. In the presence of S&#8208;aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3 are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+ and RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively. This finding provides significant insight into the optical resolution of chemical species by spontaneous resolution and the origin of homochirality in nature.

Towards new AuIII anticancer agents. Herein a redox&#8208;stabilised DNA&#8208;targeting AuIII bis(carbene) pincer complex with significant cytotoxicity is reported that is likely underpinned by partial DNA intercalation. In silico studies indicate that the complex can also target unusual DNA forms such as 3&#8208;way junctions and Z&#8208;DNA. The structures of several multinuclear AgI complexes discovered en route to the target AuIII complex were also elucidated.







Abstract
The syntheses of bis(triazolium)carbazole precursors and their corresponding coinage metal (Au, Ag) complexes are reported. For alkylated triazolium salts, di&#8208; or tetranuclear complexes with bridging ligands were isolated, while the bis(aryl) analogue afforded a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer complex suitable for oxidation to the redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation. Although the ligand salt and the [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex were both notably cytotoxic toward the breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, the AuIII complex was somewhat more selective. Electrophoresis, viscometry, UV&#8208;vis, CD and LD spectroscopy suggest the cytotoxic [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex behaves as a partial DNA intercalator. In silico screening indicated that the [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex can target DNA three&#8208;way junctions with good specificity, several other regular B&#8208;DNA forms, and Z&#8208;DNA. Multiple hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;type interactions involving T and A bases appear to be important for B&#8208;form DNA binding, while phosphate O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions evidently underpin Z&#8208;DNA binding. The CNC ligand effectively stabilizes the AuIII ion, preventing reduction in the presence of glutathione. Both the redox stability and DNA affinity of the hit compound might be key factors underpinning its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Withaferin A Inspired Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8350-8357, June 4, 2021. </description>

The structural and functional properties of withaferin A suggested the design of a new candidate for Hedgehog pathway inhibitions. The enantioselective synthesis permitted the identification of two promising hits.







Abstract
Withanolides constitute a well&#8208;known family of plant&#8208;based alkaloids characterised by widespread biological properties, including the ability of interfering with Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. Following our interest in natural products and in anticancer compounds, we report here the synthesis of a new class of Hh signalling pathway inhibitors, inspired by withaferin A, the first isolated member of withanolides. The decoration of our scaffolds was rationally supported by in silico studies, while functional evaluation revealed promising candidates, confirming once again the importance of natural products as inspiration source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. A stereoselective approach, based on Brown chemistry, allowed the obtainment and the functional evaluation of the enantiopure hit compounds.

         <title>Strong Electronic Communication in Linearly Elongated Rylenes Featuring Tunable Bridges</title>

Efficient synthetic pathways and purification strategies to access regioisomerically pure isomers of a perylene&#8208;perylene homodimer and a perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 and 35 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs are reported. Furthermore, their optoelectronic properties were tuned via protonation and methylation of their dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit.







Abstract
A modified synthetic pathway towards perylene&#8208;perylene dimers and a facile purification method to obtain the regioisomerically pure syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers are reported. In addition, a novel perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs was designed and synthesized on the basis of a previously described precursor and the resulting regioisomers were separated from each other. Thereby, the opto&#8208;electronic properties of the linearly elongated chromophores could be investigated regarding the differences in length of their aromatic system and the configuration of the isomers. Further tuning of their energy gaps was realized via protonation and methylation of the dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit. Extraordinary red&#8208;shifts of the absorption maxima of 62&#8197;nm for the methylated and 92&#8197;nm for the protonated perylene&#8208;perylene anti&#8208;isomer could be achieved. Moreover, the maxima for the syn&#8208;isomer could be shifted bathochromically by 87 and 113&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <dc:description>
The frontispiece shows the transformation of Fischer Carbene Complexes in a wide variety of compounds through of Higher&#8208;order Cycloadditions. The flask, containing the carbene, pour on the paper the different products synthesized in the last 20&#8197;years. In the background, the blackboard draws traces of important contributions in the area, such as the orbital correlation diagrams for Higher&#8208;order Cycloadditions and the representation of molecular orbitals made by Woodward and Hoffmann, that established the bases in this research area. For more details see the Review by M.&#8197;A. V&#225;zquez et&#8197;al. on 8233&#8197;ff.

The technically relevant ligand precursor 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbiphenol is usually obtained by oxidative coupling using mostly environmentally less benign processes. The electrochemical dehydrogenative electrochemical synthesis is an attractive and green technique to make this particular molecule. The different anodic approaches for oxidative coupling and challenges associated are surveyed by S.&#8197;R. Waldvogel et al. in the Minireview on page&#8197;8252&#8197;ff.

         <title>Cover Feature: Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles (Chem. Eur. J. 32/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8230-8230, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of coordination polymer nanoparticles by a copper(I) coordination compound containing cubane&#8208;like clusters as nodes connected by hybrid thioether&#8208;phosphine ligands has been achieved in aqueous media. The formed particles display a yellow aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The change in the environment triggers a morphological transformation towards elongated aggregates due to changes in the coordination environment, opening the cubane units and causing a cyan emission. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Moreno&#8208;Alc&#225;ntar et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100865).

A challenging synthesis yields a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer precursor complex that may be oxidized to a remarkably redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation which shows significant cytotoxicity towards a breast cancer cell line. Electrophoresis, viscometry, and spectroscopic data suggest the likely mode of interaction of the compound with DNA involves partial intercalation, enabling it to potentially target both conventional and unconventional DNA species such as three&#8208;way junctions (in silico data).

A fluorinated isocoumarin (depicted as a gladiator&#8242;s shield in the cover image) is transformed from a gem&#8208;difluoroalkene (wood shield) by virtue of the cool property of an indium catalyst (shooting star). Both fluorinated heterocycles and isocoumarins are alluring structural motifs, and we developed a comprehensive and novel strategy for the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarins. Indium salts possess a moderate Lewis&#8208;acidity and affinity with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and both properties accomplished the reaction system.

An overview of different sustainable synthetic approaches, with a focus on the anodic dehydrogenative homocoupling of 2,4&#8208;dimethylphenol, is provided. Due to technical interest in this outstanding molecule as a ligand building block for transition&#8208;metal catalysis, the scale&#8208;up of electrochemical processes is surveyed, for both batch&#8208;type and continuous&#8208;flow processes up to the technical scale.







Abstract
The symmetric biphenol 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol is a well&#8208;known ligand building block and is used in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. In the literature, there are several synthetic routes for the preparation of this exceptional molecule. Herein, the focus is on the sustainable electrochemical synthesis of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol. A brief overview of the developmental history of this inconspicuous molecule, which is of great interest for technical applications, but has many challenges for its synthesis, is provided. The electro&#8208;organic method is a powerful, sustainable, and efficient alternative to conventional synthesis to obtain this symmetric biphenol up to the kilogram scale. Another section of this article is devoted to different process management strategies in batch&#8208;type and flow electrolysis and their respective advantages.

         <title>Fischer Carbene Complexes: A Glance at Two Decades of Research on Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8233-8251, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the reports over the past 20&#8197;years on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions (HOC) involving Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) to obtain diverse carbocycles and heterocycles. The FCCs analyzed contain group VI metals, covering alkenyl, alkynyl and alkyl carbene complexes, which reacted with alkynes, allenes, enolates, fulvenes, heptafulvenes and other polyenic species through concerted or stepway process, some of them co&#8208;catalyzed by other metals. An analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for HOC.







Abstract
The structure of Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) is electron deficient. If bearing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated system, it can generate a wide variety of compounds by undergoing many different transformations, including higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. The latter are described as pericyclic reactions in which more than six electrons participate. These reactions have been employed in various areas of organic synthesis, resulting in highly selective compounds with a broad range of scaffolds. The first studies on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs frequently yielded competing byproducts. Many groups have attempted to increase selectivity by exploring distinct reaction conditions, reagents and co&#8208;catalysts (e.&#8201;g., metal&#8208;mediated cycloadditions). The present review is the first to focus exclusively on using higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs to synthesize carbocycles and heterocycles. Based on two decades of reports, an analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and the structural diversity obtained by the substituent effect.

The electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes by using B2Pin2 as the boron source is reported. This reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. In addition, the mechanism of this transformation was study.







Abstract
Herein we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes by using B2Pin2 as the boron source. This unprecedented reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. This transformation relied on the possible electrochemical oxidation of an in&#8197;situ formed borate. This anodic oxidation performed in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a putative boryl radical, which reacted on the alkyne.

         <title>Iridium Complex of N&#8208;Fused Bilatrienone: Oxidative Cleavage of N&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Induced by Iridium&#8208;Cyclooctadiene Complexation</title>

Metalation&#8208;assisted oxidative degradation: Reaction of N&#8208;fused porphyrin with iridium&#8208;cyclooctadiene under aerobic conditions yielded a unique ring&#8208;opened N&#8208;fused bilatrienone analog. The resulting species was isolated as an octahedral iridium complex with significantly modified optical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
N&#8208;fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near&#8208;infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri&#8208;fused pentacyclic moiety. Here, the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone is reported as the degradation product of Ir&#8208;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized (&#954;1,&#951;3&#8208;C8H12)&#8208;Ir complex.

         <title>Oligomers Intermediates in Between Two New Distinct Homonuclear Uranium(IV) DOTP Complexes**
</title>

The interaction between tetravalent uranium and DOTP, a cyclen&#8208;derived tetraphosphonic ligand, was studied in aqueous solutions. It resulted in the eventual formation of two new different homo&#8208;nuclear species, [UIV(DOTPH4)] and [UIV(DOTPH6)2]. Various analytical techniques showed that a pH&#8208;dependent, reversible and irreversible oligomerization processes govern both species in&#8208;solution dynamics.







Abstract
Two new aqueous UIV complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH6)2] complex, in which the UIV cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a C4 symmetry. The second is the &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; [U(DOTPH4)] complex, in which the tetravalent cation is located between the macrocycle O4 and N4 planes. With the help of UV&#8208;Vis absorption, 1H/31P&#8197;NMR, ATR&#8208;IR, and MALDI&#8208;TOFMS analytical techniques, the chemical interchange between both species is presented. It is shown that the one&#8208;way transition is governed by the formation of a multiple number of soluble oligomeric species consisting of varied stoichiometric ratios of both characterized homonuclear complexes.

         <title>Modular Toolkit of Multifunctional Block Copoly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for the Synthesis of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8283-8287, June 4, 2021. </description>

Polyoxazoline block copolymers offer a wide range of possibilities for application depending on their molecular structure and properties. This study introduces the huge potential of this polyoxazoline toolkit and demonstrates how tailor&#8208;made toolkit polymers can be applied in representative systems.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification provides an elegant way to introduce chemical functionalities onto macromolecules to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with superior properties. This concept was adapted to well&#8208;defined block copolymers of the poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) family and demonstrated the large potential of these macromolecules as universal toolkit for numerous applications. Triblock copolymers with separated water&#8208;soluble, alkyne&#8208; and alkene&#8208;containing segments were synthesized and orthogonally modified with various low&#8208;molecular weight functional molecules by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and thiol&#8208;ene (TE) click reactions, respectively. Representative toolkit polymers were used for the synthesis of gold, iron oxide and silica nanoparticles.

Representative toolkit polymers were used for the synthesis of gold, iron oxide and silica nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrosilylation of Ketenes with Silicon Electrophiles: Access to Fully Substituted Aldehyde&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8273-8276, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted silyl enol ethers derived from aldehydes are difficult to prepare. This rare class of compounds has been made accessible by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free hydrosilylation of ketenes with B(C6F5)3 as catalyst and Et3SiH as stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope is decent, and the stereoselectivity moderate to good in selected cases.







Abstract
Little&#8208;explored hydrosilylation of ketenes promoted by main&#8208;group catalysts is reported. The boron Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane accelerates the slow uncatalyzed reaction of ketenes and hydrosilanes, thereby providing a convenient access to the new class of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers. Yields are moderate to high, and Z configuration is preferred. The corresponding silyl bis&#8208;enol ethers are also available when using dihydrosilanes. The related trityl&#8208;cation&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation involving self&#8208;regeneration of silylium ions is far less effective.

&#8220;The DFT calculation results revealed an attractive characteristic of indium atoms with fluorine atoms. These significant results show that indium salts act as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis activator of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene and smoothly abstract fluoride thanks to an affinity toward fluorine atoms. In indium chemistry, few results of C&#8722;F bond functionalization have been established. We achieved both indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization and the first synthesis of monofluorinated isocoumarin at the 3&#8208;position.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;8288&#8197;ff.

         <title>Broad Scope and High&#8208;Yield Access to Unsymmetrical Acyclic [11C]Ureas for Biomedical Imaging from [11C]Carbonyl Difluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [11C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines are described. This new methodology is compatible with a range of functional groups and with both aliphatic amines and anilines.







Abstract
Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2=20.4&#8197;min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [11C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.&#8201;g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [11C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through isolable [11C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [11C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [11C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [11C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [11C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Attachment of a pair of P&#8208;stereogenic mesityl(alkynyl)&#8208;phosphanyl groups at the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of a 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene framework gave mixtures of the respective rac&#8208; and meso&#8208; bis&#8208;phosphanyl diastereoisomers. They slowly epimerized in a thermally induced reaction with Gibbs activation barriers of ca. 25 kcal mol&#8208;1 at r.t. (measured and DFT calculated). The reaction of the meso&#8208;mesityl(tert.butyl&#8208;ethynyl)phosphanyl derivative with two molar equiv. of Piers&#180; borane [HB(C6F5)2] led to the formation of the alkylidene bridged geminal bis&#8208;phosphane/borane frustrated Lewis pair system.

         <title>Phosphetes via Transition Metal Free Ring Closure &#8211; Taking the Proper Turn at a Thermodynamic Crossing</title>

New route: Investigation of the phosphanide addition to alkynes revealed that the ring size can be controlled during the cyclization step leading either to phospholes or phosphetes starting from the same reactants.







Abstract
A transition metal free route to phosphetes featuring an exocyclic alkene unit is presented. In this approach phosphanides are added to a variety of diynes generating phosphaallylic intermediates which depending on the reaction conditions transform either to phosphetes or the corresponding phospholes. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combined quantum chemical and experimental means identifies phosphole formation as thermodynamically controlled reaction path, whereas kinetic control furnishes the corresponding phosphetes. Structural and luminescence properties of the rare class of phosphetes are explored, as well as for selected key intermediates.

         <title>Artificial Supramolecular Pumps Powered by Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The appropriate integration of molecular recognition and photoswitching phenomena in rotaxane&#8208;type complexes can lead to the realization of artificial supramolecular pumps driven by light. We describe the operation mechanisms of these systems, based on a flashing energy ratchet, is described, and their ability to function autonomously by dissipating light energy away from chemical equilibrium is reported.







Abstract
The development of artificial nanoscale motors that can use energy from a source to perform tasks requires systems capable of performing directionally controlled molecular movements and operating away from chemical equilibrium. Here, the design, synthesis and properties of pseudorotaxanes are described, in which a photon input triggers the unidirectional motion of a macrocyclic ring with respect to a non&#8208;symmetric molecular axle. The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behavior of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. NMR spectroscopy was used to observe the dissipative non&#8208;equilibrium state generated in&#8197;situ by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium regimes.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208; and Fluorene&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs: NIR Fluorophores with High Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Look on the bright side: Three new fluorescent aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes fused with fluorene or carbazole substituents show strong bathochromic shifts (up to 139&#8197;nm) of absorption and emission maxima compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (TPAB) and are highly photostable. Two of the dyes show excellent fluorescence brightness due to exceptionally high molar absorption coefficients (ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and emission quantum yields (up to 0.66); the third dye was rendered pH sensitive by introducing a chlorophenol motif.







Abstract
Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties have been prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (TPAB): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and emission maximum (up to 2270&#8197;cm&#8722;1); an almost threefold increase in molar absorption coefficients (to ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8211;66&#8201;%. Owing to the combination of these properties, the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit was also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100&#8197;nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on the TPAB chromophore.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of medicinal chemistry the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered as an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to the trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylations of carbon atoms. Selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups, in addition to CD3, is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8208;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights to Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. Through DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, we propose an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism. Our novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine&#8208;mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at the DLPNO/CCSD(T)&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we described the photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous flow conditions. Using 0.2 mol% of the developed [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF  6  &#160;under blue LEDs irradiation, the hydrosilylation of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes was performed in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance. The mechanism of the reaction was studied and a plausible scenario was suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present  in situ  synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S  8  results in the sublimation of S  8  , observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133 K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.</dc:description>

         <title>BODIPYs with Photoactivatable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.</dc:description>

         <title>PorphyStruct &#8211; A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PorphyStruct  , a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the  out&#8208;of&#8208;plane  dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While alkyl substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates. We recently reported on the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide ion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which features&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric character deriving from the pentafluoroethyl substituents and their strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Transferring this knowledge, we investigated the&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric behavior of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate,&#160;[Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;. In order to examine such&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric behavior, we first developed a strategy for the synthesis of the corresponding silanol Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses at room temperature to the hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane,&#160;(C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3.&#160;Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3OH employing a sterically demanding phosphazene base allows the characterization of the first example of a dimeric triorganosilanolate: the dianionic hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate,&#160;[{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722;, implies&#160;Lewis&#160;amphoteric character of the monomeric&#160;[Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;&#160;anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;bimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have described Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared with their homo&#8208;bimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic, UV&#8208;vis and DFT studies show only ring&#8208;centered oxidation after 2e&#8208;oxidations. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band of 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Strong electronic communication between two rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. Unpaired spins of Fe(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly anti&#8208;ferromagnetically coupled, while such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of Mn2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) complexes as compared to their Fe2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of &#960;&#8208;cation radical and Cu(II) ion is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) complex as compared to its Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively, however, the Cu(II) center acts as a charge donor in the heterobimetallic complexes while Fe(III)/Mn(III) center as a charge acceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions  in vacuo  . We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in  D  3h  configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;Tertiary&#8208;Butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(t  Bu2S)] (3) (TFA = trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5  , Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) (Di)azatricyclododecene Scaffold and its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel sp  3  carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. T ricyclic framework  6  was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one  9  via a gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor  11b&#8208;e  was the key to forming 6&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclized product  6  with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework  6  , a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  , which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold  7a  . C o mpounds  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z = Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy , and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound  20a  showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC  50  = 4.1 &#177; 0.8 &#956;M), whereas compounds  20a&#8208;g  showed antiviral activity with IC  50  values of 4.2&#8208;12.4 &#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Catalytic Activity for an Amphiphilic Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium Complex in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A switchable catalytic system is designed and constructed with host&#8208;guest interactions between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium (Py&#8208;Ru). Py&#8208;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibit an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD  +  to NADH. After forming inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8208;Ru aggregates are broke, leading to a decrease of catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered via competitive replacement of amantadine (AD). This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8208;guest interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous TixOy  with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7 &#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure with UV light, the white TixOy  suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8208;O environment takes place upon to 350 &#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400 &#176;C is still not fully ordered.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocin (  1  ) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin (  2  ). Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of  1  results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised  2  &#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208; coupled quinone dimer of  1  was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized ring&#8208;methylated  1  derivatives to provide stable analogs of  1  dimers able to be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally&#8208;derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of  1  .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work&#8208;out distinct characteristics is often difficult.&#160; Here, we report that the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse input promises to fill this gap. &#160;Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts).&#160; The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, synthesis, and biochemical evaluation of alpha&#8208;amanitin derivatives containing analogs of the trans&#8208;hydroxyproline residue for potential use in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;amanitin, an extremely toxic bicyclic octapeptide extracted from the death&#8208;cap mushroom,  Amanita phalloides,  is a highly selective allosteric inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Following on growing interest in using this toxin as a payload in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, herein we report the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of several new derivatives of this toxin to probe the role of the  trans  &#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp), which is known to be critical for toxicity. This structure activity relationship (SAR) study represents the first of its kind to use various Hyp&#8208;analogs to alter the conformational and H&#8208;bonding properties of Hyp in amanitin.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tunable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. Accordingly, we designed a series of substituted phosphate linkers for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1 day to 2 hours or 5 minutes, as shown for linkers containing  p  &#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing  p  &#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4 days, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, respectively) than their  p  &#8208;fluoro analogues. The  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25 minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through&#160;Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from  cis  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;  l  &#8208;alanine (  cis  &#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on  C  &#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the  cis  &#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into  trans  &#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taking advantage of ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution to design nine&#8208;membered P,O,Si&#8208;heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds have been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(II) metallohelices stabilize DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes and down&#8208;regulate expression of G&#8208;quadruplex regulated oncogenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, we employed methods of molecular biophysics and biology to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (  hTelo  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit1  ,  c&#8208;kit2  ) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (  hTelo  ) and in the promoter regions of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible optically pure metallohelices made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe(II) ions, which exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity towards duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of metallohelix containing  m  &#8208;xylenyl bridge (  5b  ) were found to be effective inhibitors of primer elongation catalyzed by  Taq  DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing  c&#8208;myc  and  c&#8208;kit2  G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of  5b  down&#8208;regulated the expression of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multi&#8208;targeted drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted in Live Cells Based on Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;cell Affinity of G&#8208;quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA computation is considered as one fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers, which has evoked substantial attention and gained rapid advancements. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially in cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, we designed a series of DNA logic gates by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further utilizing the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, we have achieved in realizing an  INHIBIT  logic gate whose operational site is precisely restricted in specific live cells. The design strategy may have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100 K were subject to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average from two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and its Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The work reports&#160;single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin&#8208;film state by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization between the triarylamine sub&#8208;chromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) form the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donor, triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration amongst the TPA core and the other donors renders the poor &#960;&#8208;conjugation in the entire chromophore, thereby the individual sub&#8208;chromophoric units still retain their individual emission characteristics which cover all the three primary color emissions. TPA&#8208;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originated from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in a lifetime, exerts linear relationship against temperature between 180 &#8211; 330 K, thereby functioning as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19 K&#8208;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with the spectral shift of 0.3 nm K&#8722;1 and its workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Induced Emission System for&#160;Selective Detectionand Efficient Removal of&#160;Mercury(II)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient strategy for simultaneously detecting and removing Hg2+&#160;from water is vital to address mercury pollution.&#160;Herein a supramolecular assembly&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;with photoluminescent properties&#160;is facilely constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of a functional pillar[5]arene bearing two N,N&#8208;dimethyldithiocarbamoyl binding sites (H) and an AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene derivative (G).&#160;Remarkably, the fluorescence of&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;can be exclusively quenched by Hg2+&#160;among the 30 cations due to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complex and only L&#8208;cysteine can restore fluorescence in the common 20 amino acids.&#160;Meanwhile, the probe&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;has a considerable thermal and pH stability, a good anti&#8208;interference property from various cations, and a satisfactory sensitivity. More importantly,&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;exhibits a prominent capability of Hg2+&#160;removal with rapid capture rate (within 1 h) and excellent adsorption efficiency (98%), as well as a highly efficient recyclability without losing any adsorption activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Saddle&#8208;shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSM.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted meta&#8208;Halophenols by Anion&#8208;Accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclic Ring&#8208;Opening</title>

         <dc:description>Disrotatory &#8208; thermally allowed &#8208; 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature, to give their corresponding  meta  &#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8208;92% yield, average 65%). Many of the phenols hold unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was featured by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated by an ab initio study, which concluded that base mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the  meta  &#8208;halophenol.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Non&#8208;aqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, in comparison to RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high voltage non&#8208;aqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of trace oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes, mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, we propose diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in non&#8208;aqueous organic RFB. We demonstrate organic RFBs utilizing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) (1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino) anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;Di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis (2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of redox pairs. Symmetric flow cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic non&#8208;aqueous RFBs</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding directing groups and their pivotal role in C&#8211;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8211;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways  via  which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8211;H activation.&#160;Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8211;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8211;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues.&#160;Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8211;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level.&#160;A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope.</dc:description>

This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8211;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level.&#160;A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
