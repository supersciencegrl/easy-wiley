         <title>Umpolung Reactivity of Imine Ester: Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Imino Esters by Phenylsilane and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations, and deuteration experiments indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99&#8201;% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D2O as a cheap deuterium source.

         <title>Anion Recognition with Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) pnictogen bonding (PnB) triaryl&#8208;based anion receptors demonstrate PnB anion binding strength is influenced strongly by the electronic withdrawing nature of the aryl substituent and pnictogen atom donor identity. The triaryl PnB receptors display chloride anion selectivity over a range of halides and oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding investigations of the first mixed PnB&#8208;HB anion host systems are also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic antimony(III) and bismuth(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors: 1&#8901;Sb2CF3 and 1&#8901;Bi2CF3, reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl&#8722; selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl&#8722; in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity.

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron decoupling (eDec) attenuates the electron&#8208;nuclei hyperfine interaction (depicted as the magenta sphere) and, thus, improves the NMR sensitivity by &#8764;80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the combined DNP and eDec technique reveals that the intramolecular nuclei in trityl and paramagnetic MgHOTP MOF are outside the spin diffusion barrier.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8208;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can facilitate direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an &#8764;80&#8201;% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35&#8197;T and 80&#8197;K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of 
 &#8764;90 and &#8764;11&#8201;% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).

         <title>Sterically and Electronically Flexible Pyridylidene Amine Dinitrogen Ligands at Palladium: Hemilabile cis/trans Coordination and Application in Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N,N,N&#8208;pyridylidene&#8211;amine (PYE) was synthesized, and its coordination to palladium was investigated. A flexible and hemilabile behavior of the ligand was put in light in terms of donation properties (zwitterionic vs. neutral) and in terms of geometry (cis/trans coordination). The complexes were found to catalytically dehydrogenate formic acid in CO2 and H2 in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity.







Abstract
Ligand design is crucial for the development of new catalysts and materials with new properties. Herein, the synthesis and unique hemilabile coordination properties of new bis&#8208;pyridylidene amine (bis&#8208;PYE) ligands to palladium, and preliminary catalytic activity of these complexes in formic acid dehydrogenation are described. The synthetic pathway to form cationic complexes [Pd(bis&#8208;PYE)Cl(L)]X with a cis&#8208;coordinated N,N&#8208;bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand is flexible and provides access to a diversity of PdII complexes with different ancillary ligands (L=pyridine, DMAP, PPh3, Cl, P(OMe)3). The 1H&#8197;NMR chemical shift of the trans&#8208;positioned PYE N&#8722;CH3 unit is identified as a convenient and diagnostic handle to probe the donor properties of these ancillary ligands and demonstrates the electronic flexibility of the PYE ligand sites. In the presence of a base, the originally cis&#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;PYE ligand adopts a N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination mode with the two PYE units in mutual trans position. This cis&#8211;trans isomerization is reverted in presence of an acid, demonstrating a unique structural and steric flexibility of the bis&#8208;PYE ligand at palladium in addition to its electronic adaptability. The palladium complexes are active in formic acid dehydrogenation to H2 and CO2. The catalytic performance is directly dependent on the ligand bonding mode, the nature of the ancillary ligand, the counteranion, and additives. The most active system features a bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand, PPh3 as ancillary ligand and accomplishes turnover frequencies up to 525&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the first hour and turnover numbers of nearly 1000, which is the highest activity reported for palladium&#8208;based catalysts to date.

DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering has greatly expanded the toolbox of cell surface engineering and gave rise to a variety of novel and fascinating applications. Herein, we summarize recent advances in DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and the biological applications in mimicking natural cellular components, regulating cell signal transduction, manipulating cell&#8208;cell interaction and tracking molecules on or around the cell surface.







Abstract
Due to its excellent programmability and biocompatibility, DNA molecule has unique advantages in cell surface engineering. Recent progresses provide a reliable and feasible way to engineer cell surfaces with diverse DNA molecules and DNA nanostructures. The abundant form of DNA nanostructures has greatly expanded the toolbox of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and gave rise to a variety of novel and fascinating applications. In this review, we summarize recent advances in DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and its biological applications. We first introduce some widely used methods of immobilizing DNA molecules on cell surfaces and their application features. Then we discuss the approaches of employing DNA nanostructures and dynamic DNA nanotechnology as elements for creating functional cell surfaces. Finally, we review the extensive biological applications of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and discuss the challenges and prospects of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering.

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined CaTaO2N single crystals with uniform particle size were successfully synthesized through a one&#8208;pot NaCl&#8208;assisted nitridation procedure. The performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO by H2O under visible light was enhanced due to the high crystallinity of CaTaO2N and the modification with core&#8208;shell structured Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst.







Abstract
Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO2N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO2N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO2N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process gave a 2.4 times higher amount of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni  2+  and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni  2+  with abundant H  2  S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect  in vitro  and  in vivo  . This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  (  P  , 1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive  P  :  P  pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  pairs, irrespective of whether (  S  )&#8208;  P  or (  R  )&#8208;  P  is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (  S  )&#8208;  P  but not for (  R  )&#8208;  P  . This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8211; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8211;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in a Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by p&#8208;system and the steric hinderance by bulky groups. Herein we report a new class of boryl radicals with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) adducts ligated by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by CAAC ligand and the weak but significant B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8208;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.</dc:description>

Two-electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C-H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Sulfur Atoms on TADF Properties from Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the heavy atom effect is the most useful way for boosting reverse intersystem crossing process for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters aiming to shorten the excited state lifetime and enhance the emission efficiency. A detailed investigation on S&#8208;containing TADF molecules featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer excited state shows that the heavier and bigger atom may have adverse effect because of its multiple roles.







Abstract
The harnessing of heavy atom effect of chalcogen elements offers a way for boosting the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of purely organic luminescent materials that can harvest triplet excitons. However, the conformational and electronic variations induced by the heavy and large atoms may also have adverse effects on the TADF properties. Herein, the design, synthesis, and structures of a new type of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emitters containing benzothiazino[2,3,4&#8208;kl]phenothiazine (DPTZ) as the donor unit are reported. The influences of S atoms on the emission properties have been systematically investigated by means of theoretical simulations, electrochemical and spectroscopic studies. Although the presence of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and calculated spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) values are beneficial for TSCT&#8208;TADF properties, the triplet TSCT states are uplifted to above the locally excited (LE) state of the acceptor moieties. As a result, the new emitters display longer delayed fluorescence lifetimes (&#964;DF) of 255.0&#8211;114.3&#8197;&#956;s and lower PLQYs of 45&#8211;61&#8201;% in comparison with the O&#8208;containing congeners (&#964;DF=26.9&#8211;6.8&#8197;&#956;s; PLQYs=74&#8211;71&#8201;%). This work highlights that a full consideration of various effects is essential when making use of heavy chalcogen atoms for the design of TADF emitters.

         <title>Regulating Oxygen Configuration in Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low oxygen content (particularly low C&#8722;O/C=O ratio) and high graphitization degree of hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets are responsible for the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate and durable Na+ storage.







Abstract
Surface oxygen functionalities (particularly C&#8722;O configuration) in carbon materials have negative influence on their electrical conductivity and Na+ storage performance. Herein, we propose a concept from surface chemistry to regulate the oxygen configuration in hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNS). It is demonstrated that the C&#8722;O/C=O ratio in HPCNS reduces from 1.49 to 0.43 and its graphitization degree increases by increasing the carbonization temperature under a reduction atmosphere. Remarkably, such high graphitization degree and low C&#8722;O content of the HPCNS&#8208;800 are favorable for promoting its electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate (323.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 138.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and durable (96&#8201;% capacity retention over 5700&#8197;cycles at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) Na+ storage performance. This work permits the optimization of heteroatom configurations in carbon for superior Na+ storage.

         <title>Competitive Photoisomerization and Energy Transfer Processes in Fluorescent Multichromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. We highlight the prominent role of intramolecular homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between the different isomers of the chromophores at the origin of their peculiar photophysical and photochemical properties.







Abstract
Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization are fascinating, with complex interchromophoric interactions. The experimental and theoretical study of a series of compounds, bearing a variable number of 4&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;6&#8208;(p&#8208;(N&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl)aminostyryl)&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) units are reported. The photophysical properties of multi&#8208;DCM derivatives, namely 2DCM and 3DCM, were compared to the single model azido&#8208;functionalized DCM, in the E and Z isomers. The (EE)&#8208;2DCM and (EEE)&#8208;3DCM were synthesized via the click reaction. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and photokinetics experiments under UV or visible irradiation indicated the presence of intramolecular energy transfer processes among the DCM units. Homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between adjacent chromophores were confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy and decays. Molecular dynamics simulations for 2DCM were carried out and analyzed using a Markov state model, providing geometrical parameters (orientation and distance between chromophores) and energy transfer efficiency. This work contributes to a better understanding and rationalization of multiple energy transfer processes occuring within multichromophoric systems.

         <title>How Water and Ion Mobility Affect the NMR Fingerprints of the Hydrated JBW Zeolite: A Combined Computational&#8208;Experimental Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovering the aluminium location is a challenging endeavour in zeolites, as overlapping resonances complicate spectral assignment. Combining theoretical and experimental NMR is indispensable in spectral interpretation while the inclusion of configurationally diverse water molecules is essential.







Abstract
An important aspect within zeolite synthesis is to make fully tunable framework materials with controlled aluminium distribution. A major challenge in characterising these zeolites at operating conditions is the presence of water. In this work, we investigate the effect of hydration on the 27Al NMR parameters of the ultracrystalline K,Na&#8208;compensated aluminosilicate JBW zeolite using experimental and computational techniques. The JBW framework, with Si/Al ratio of 1, is an ideal benchmark system as a stepping stone towards more complicated zeolites. The presence and mobility of water and extraframework species directly affect NMR fingerprints. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, for which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#1060;  FL  &lt; 10%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we report a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#1060;  FL  up to 56.8% for racemate and 36.5% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8208;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide range of functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle was tentatively proposed via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8208;I rather than NiII&#8208;aryl bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Dithiolopyrrolones are Prochelators that Are Activated by Glutathione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs), such as holomycin, are natural products that hold promise as scaffolds for antibiotics as they exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. They consist of a unique bicyclic core containing a disulfide that is crucial for their biological activity. Herein, we establish the DTPs as prochelators. We show that the disulfides are reduced at cellular gluathione levels. This activates the drugs and initiates interactions with targets, particularly metal coordination. In addition, we report an expedient synthesis for the DTPs thiolutin and aureothricin, providing facile access to important natural DTPs and derivatives thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating a TADF Emitter by Time Resolved Near Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emitters for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S  1  )&#8208;triplet (T  1  ) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by the vibronic mixing with higher excited states S   n=2,3,4,&#8230;   and T   n=2,3,4,&#8230;   . For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time resolved near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of  18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in  n  BuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved  18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5 &#181;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve  18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1% and 30&#177;3% using only 2.5 &#181;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases catalyze ring opening reactions of cyclic epoxides with diverse anionic nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#183;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#183;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8208; which condensate to [Sn2S6]4&#8208;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8208;H bond cleavage, S2&#8208; protonation, Sn&#8208;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8208;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8208;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8208;situ1H NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover &#8776;0.38&#160;%/h.

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linearly&#8208;fused poliarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208; carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein,&#160;we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Hydride Cation Dimer Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes and H2 Isotope Exchange: Competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca Bridges and Terminal Ca&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH  2  CaL]  2+  (macrocyclic ligand L = NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me  4  TACD) showed remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H  2  isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH  +  . In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H  2  isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing netlike nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with hetero&#8208;junction as robust material for electrochemical amine detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8 &#956;A mM  &#8722;1  and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25 &#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Rechargeable Sodium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to the relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for the commercialization of SMBs. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on SMBs in terms of Na anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing to Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs have been summarized. In addition, the insertion&#8208;type cathode materials and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials have also been introduced. Finally, the future outlook for the practical SMBs has been provided.</dc:description>

In this review, we summarize the recent progress on SMBs in terms of Na anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing to Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs have been summarized. In addition, the insertion-type cathode materials and conversion-type cathode materials have also been introduced. Finally, the future outlook for the practical SMBs has been provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesopores P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow spheres for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. We report a simultaneous loading of Ni  2  P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P photocatalyst. Ni  2  P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of sodium pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E = C, N, P) triple bonds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2a&#8208;c, 4a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggest a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2a and 4b. The anions 2a&#8208;c, 4a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards Fe(II) to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3a&#8208;c, 5a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydride&#8208;Substituted Homoleptic Silylborate: How Similar is it to its Diborane(6)&#8208;Dianion Isostere?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The B&#8208;nucleophilic 9H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene dianion reacts with 9&#8208;chloro&#8208;9&#8208;silafluorene to afford air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable silylborate salts M[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2] (M[HBSiH], M = Li, Na). Li[HBSiH] and Me3SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar2(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2 ((py)BSiH) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar2] (Li[HBSiCl]) in C6H6&#8208;pyridine or THF. In both cases, the first step is H&#8722; abstraction at the B center. The resulting free borane subsequently binds a py or thf ligand. While the py adduct is stable at room temperature, the thf adduct undergoes a 1,2&#8208;H shift via the cyclic B(&#956;&#8208;H)Si intermediate BHSi, which is afterwards attacked at the Si atom by a Cl&#8722; ion to give Li[HBSiCl]. DFT calculations were employed to support the proposed reaction mechanism and to characterize the electronic structure of BHSi. Treatment of Li[HBSiCl] with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IMe introduces the neutral donor at the Si atom and leads to Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(IMe)Ar2 (HBSi(IMe)), a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;stabilized silylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed&#160;Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist&#8217;s collection of photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformations of Strained Three&#8208;Membered Rings a Common, Yet Overlooked, Motif in Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunnel vision: The (trans)formation of three&#8208;membered rings is identified as a motif present in the majority of computationally and experimentally studied examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. The reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed through a survey of different types of ring transformations throughout the tunneling literature.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, thus highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction of and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.

         <title>Differentiable Formation of Chiroptical Lanthanide Heterometallic LnnLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) Tetrahedra with C2&#8208;Symmetrical Bis(tridentate) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic supramolecular tetrahedra can be prepared by self&#8208;assembly of lanthanide ions with ligand L followed by crystallization. Upon ether diffusion with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Gd2L3] helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunGd&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Ligand L demonstrated preferential formation of heterometallic tetrahedron which is confirmed by MS deconvolution.







Abstract
Construction of lanthanide heterometallic complex is important for engineering multifunction molecular containers. However, it remains a challenge because of the similar ionic radii of lanthanides. Herein we attempt to prepare chiral lanthanide heterometallic tetrahedra. Upon crystallization with a mixture of [Eu2L3] and [Ln2L3] (Ln=Gd, Tb and Dy) helicates, a mixture of heterometallic EunLn&#8217;4&#8208;n(L6) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Selective formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was observed as MS deconvolution results deviated from statistical results. The formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was found to be sensitive to ionic radii as well as the ratio of the two helicates used in the crystallization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heterometallic supramolecular tetrahedra&lt;/b&gt; can be prepared by self-assembly of lanthanide ions with ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; followed by crystallization. Upon ether diffusion with a mixture of [Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] helicates, a mixture of heterometallic Eu&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Gd&#8217;&lt;sub&gt;4-n&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Ligand &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated preferential formation of heterometallic tetrahedron which is confirmed by MS deconvolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction of lanthanide heterometallic complex is important for engineering multifunction molecular containers. However, it remains a challenge because of the similar ionic radii of lanthanides. Herein we attempt to prepare chiral lanthanide heterometallic tetrahedra. Upon crystallization with a mixture of [Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (Ln=Gd, Tb and Dy) helicates, a mixture of heterometallic Eu&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Ln&#8217;&lt;sub&gt;4-n&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) (n=0&#8211;4) tetrahedra was prepared. Selective formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was observed as MS deconvolution results deviated from statistical results. The formation of heterometallic tetrahedron was found to be sensitive to ionic radii as well as the ratio of the two helicates used in the crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In essentially one&#8208;pot, using Ir&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis, tris(arene)&#8208;functionalized cationic [4]helicenes are synthesized with full regioselectivity and enantiospecificity starting from a trivial precursor (17 examples). This poly&#8208;addition of aryl groups improves key optical properties, that is, fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes. Electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signatures are observed up to the far&#8208;red domain, in particular with additional arenes prone to aggregation.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium methyl complex has been employed for alkene and alkyne hydroboration. The methodology has been extended towards terpenes. A detailed theoretical calculation has been provided to understand the mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (1 and 2) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them 1 has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>

In the present work, BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction structures were introduced for visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. At the same time, a novel BChl&#8722;Chl&#8208;based organic heterojunction noble metal&#8208;free BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was successfully constructed by a simple alternating deposition process of Chl and BChl on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.







Abstract
Hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx composite has a high HER performance with 114&#8197;&#956;mol/h/gcat, which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx and Chl@Ti3C2Tx composites.

         <title>Gel&#228;nder Molecules with Orthogonal Joints: Synthesis of Macrocyclic Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design for &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architectures is presented with orthogonal joints between axis, rungs, and banister. Following this design concept, two macrocyclic model compounds are synthesized, fully characterized, and separated into room temperature stable enantiomers with the banister helically wrapped around the axis.







Abstract
Orthogonal joints, understood as connections with an angle of 90&#176;, were introduced in the design of the &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; model compounds 1 and 2. The banister, consisting of a conjugated carbazole dimer linked by either 1,3&#8208;butadiyne (2) or a single thiophene (1), wraps around an axis composed of a phthalimide dimer due to the dimensional mismatch of both subunits, which are interconnected by phenylene rungs. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; structure was assembled from a monomer comprising the 1,4&#8208;diaminobenzene rung with one amino substituent as part of a 4&#8208;bromo phthalimide subunit forming the orthogonal junction to the axis, and the other as part of a masked 2&#8208;ethynyl carbazole as orthogonal joint to the banister. The macrocycle was obtained by two sequential homocoupling steps. A first dimerization by a reductive homocoupling assembled the axis, while an oxidative acetylene coupling served as ring&#8208;closing reaction. The formed butadiyne was further derivatized to a thiophene, rendering all carbons of the model compound sp2 hybridized. Both helical structures were fully characterized and chirally resolved. Assignment of the enantiomers was achieved by simulation of chiroptical properties and enantiopure synthesis.

         <title>Development of an Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic &#945;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters for Asymmetric Synthesis of 3&#8208;Fluoropiperidines</title>

Get into Gear: The Trost ligand series promotes the enantioselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters to generate 3&#8208;fluoropiperidines in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. We have employed the Lloyd&#8208;Jones Norrby model to explain the origins of enantiocontrol and propose that the catalyst backbone engenders a gearing effect whereby the ester adopts an s&#8208;trans conformation that enforces the alkene moiety of the enoate to adopt an s&#8208;cis orientation, thereby controlling facial to the &#960;&#8208;allyl complex.







Abstract
The first useful enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been achieved using the Trost family of chiral ligands yielding products in up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;ee. This work provides new insights regarding the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroenolates and shows experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems are not necessarily due to the presence of E/Z enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows the easy preparation of useful 3&#8208;fluoropiperidine intermediates, and it is demonstrated that these systems are applicable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoparticles Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: From Structural Characterization to Applications</title>

Small water&#8208;soluble N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (NHC@AuNPs) were synthesized via the bottom&#8208;up approach and showed suitability for applications in catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; synthesis of two water&#8208;soluble gold nanoparticles (AuNP&#8208;1 and AuNP&#8208;2) stabilized by hydrophilic mono&#8208; and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small quasi&#8208;spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (ca. 2.3&#8211;2.6&#8197;nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the NHC@AuNPs were supported on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for their photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) were obtained in human cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards wastewater remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Interaction for Photocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering of photodeposited Au/TiO2 with enhanced metal&#8211;semiconductor interaction and ultrafine Au nanoparticles by a sacrificial carbon&#8208;coating annealing strategy facilitates to transfer photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to nanosized Au to drive photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The selective immobilization of noble metals right at the place where photogenerated electrons migrate through the photodeposition approach is a unique strategy to load cocatalysts on semiconductors for solar hydrogen production. However, a poor metal&#8211;semiconductor interaction is often formed, which not only hinders the interfacial charge transfer, but also results in the easy aggregation and shedding of cocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions. Herein, it is demonstrated that the photodeposited ultrafine metals, such as nanosized Au, can be well stabilized on TiO2 nanocrystallines without sintering by employing a sacrificial carbon coating annealing strategy to strengthen the metal&#8208;support interaction. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between Au and TiO2 for fast charge transfer and the well&#8208;preserved size&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Au nanoparticles toward hydrogen evolution reaction, the annealed Au/TiO2 exhibits a significant enhanced activity toward photocatalytic H2 production with good durability.

Prismarene hosts can be prepared by a direct macrocyclization of functionalized naphthalene monomers. Water soluble prismarene hosts H1 and H3 bind to hydrophobic dications in phosphate buffered saline with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for G9. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.







Abstract
We report that the direct macrocyclization of naphthalene monomers bearing ethyl ester functional groups delivers prism[5]arene derivatives, which can be deprotected to yield water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arenes (H1 and H3). 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy showed that dicationic guests bind with the hydrophobic cores buried inside the anisotropic magnetically shielding cavity. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that H1 and H3 are high&#8208;affinity hosts in PBS&#8208;buffered water with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for a select guest. The complexation events are driven by the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic interactions. Host H1 displays somewhat higher affinity toward a common guest than pillar[6]arene bearing carboxylic acid functional groups but is significantly less potent than pillar[6]arene bearing sulfate groups. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.

The combination of experimental and computed data allows to disentangle and quantify complex dynamic conformational mixtures of xylosides. Computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants bridge the gap between experimental NMR data and the conformer distribution.







Abstract
The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.

         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot protocol for the concise and rapid synthesis of 4&#8208;pyridinyl pyrroles involved in in&#8197;situ generated 2H&#8208;azirine was developed. 1/7&#8208;Pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were further constructed. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission compared with phenyl analogues. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed ICT characteristic effect and may be located in lysosome in cells.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium near&#8208;infrared (NIR) Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium&gt;pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful &#8216;&#8216;alkalinizing effects&#8217;&#8217; of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Labeled Riboswitch Synthesized from a Protected TPA Phosphoramidite Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>

The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) has been protected with a light sensitive 2&#8208;NBOM group and connected to a uridine phosphoramidite building block. Spin&#8208;labeled RNA can be obtained from this compound by standard protocols of oligonucleotide synthesis and used for EPR studies after light&#8208;induced deprotection.







Abstract
The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) is an excellent spin label for EPR studies of RNA. Previous synthetic methods, however, are complicated and require special equipment. Herein, we describe a uridine derived phosphoramidite with a photocaged TPA unit attached. The light sensitive 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxymethyl group can be removed in high yield by short irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. Based on this approach, a doubly spin&#8208;labeled 27mer neomycin sensing riboswitch was synthesized and studied by PELDOR. The overall thermal stability of the fold is not much reduced by TPA. In&#8208;line probing nevertheless detected changes in local mobility.

         <title>Understanding the Anion&#8208;Templated, OSDA&#8208;Free, Interzeolite Conversion Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ZK&#8208;5

High silica forms of the zeolite ZK&#8208;5 are prepared by an interzeolite conversion using inorganic cations and anions as templates. K+ and Cs+ cations and NO3&#8722; anions self&#8208;assemble within its lta and pau cages with a high degree of space filling and exchange with NH4+ followed by heating gives a microporous solid. This approach offers an alternative and organic structure directing agent&#8208;free route to directing zeolite synthesis.







Abstract
High silica zeolite ZK&#8208;5 (framework Si/Al=4.8) has been prepared by interzeolite conversion from ultrastable zeolite Y via a co&#8208;templating route using alkali metal cations and nitrate anions but without organic structure directing agents. The mechanism, which involves zeolite framework &#8211; alkali metal cation &#8211; nitrate anion ordering, has been established by a combination of chemical and thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy, computational modelling, and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. Ammonium exchange gives ZK&#8208;5 with occluded ammonium nitrate and subsequent heating gives microporous zeolite ZK&#8208;5.

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules&#8208;PyS and PyD were synthesized. Due to the more twisted and extended backbone, the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and showed solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance.







Abstract
Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat Cmca space group in single&#8208;crystal system compared with P21/n for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting&#8208;molecule SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.&#8201;g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.

&lt;p&gt;Single-emitting-layer white organic light-emitting diodes (SEL-WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host-dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL-WOLEDs and the development of simple non-doped SEL-WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single-white-emitting molecules for non-doped SEL-WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene-based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono-fused one to bis-fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis-fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat &lt;i&gt;Cmca&lt;/i&gt; space group in single-crystal system compared with &lt;i&gt;P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/n&lt;/i&gt; for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution-processed non-doped single-white-emitting-molecule SEL-WOLED with high performance (e.&#8201;g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of an Allenyne&#8208;Alkyne [4+2] Cycloaddition and its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex character of a strained molecule. the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene generated via the [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne can be trapped with a hydrogen atom donor or nucleophiles with two opposite regioselectivity; oxygen nucleophiles are incorporated at the benzylic position whereas amine nucleophiles are incorporated onto the aromatic core. This unique reactivity and selectivity is exploited for selaginpuvilin synthesis.







Abstract
A new [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.

&#8220;A POM out of the blue&#8221;. Decatungstate anion photocatalyzed a mild dearomatization of indoles to access 2&#8208;acylindolines via direct hydrogen atom transfer under purple&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
We report herein a convenient and scalable dearomative hydroacylation reaction of indoles. Employing readily available aldehydes as the acyl source and TBADT as an inexpensive direct HAT photocatalyst, a variety of indoles derivatives were converted into synthetically interesting 2&#8208;acylindolines in good to excellent yields as well as great diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction was successfully developed and an experimental mechanistic investigation was carried out in order to gain further insights on the assumed reaction pathway.

         <title>Reverse Replacement in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125&#8201;with 1,4&#8208;Dicarboxybenzene for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>

Partial ligand substitution in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 through solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange by BDC enhances the photo&#8208;generated charge separation, which promotes the hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times higher hydrogen production rate compared to the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the field of ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase: Experimental and Computational Insights into the Influence of an Organic Co&#8208;solvent on the Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 56, October 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pros and cons considered: Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are versatile enzymes employed in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. To increase substrate solubility, DMSO stands out as the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent. Here we found that DMSO acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme HheC. To understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level, in&#8208;depth experimental studies were performed in combination with molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of the interactions of solvent with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, the homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO/water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Even 5&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering methods and MD studies revealed that HheC maintains its structural integrity with as much as 30&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO.

         <title>Reversible Oxidative Addition of Zinc Hydride at a Gallium(I)&#8208;Centre: Labile Mono&#8208; and Bis(hydridogallyl)zinc Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Zinc dihydride reacts with a gallium(I) reagent by reversible oxidative addition to provide di&#8208; and trimetallic hydridogallyl zinc complexes. The position of oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination equilibria can be controlled by coordination/decoordination of TMEDA.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), partially deaggregated zinc dihydride as hydrocarbon suspensions react with the gallium(I) compound [(BDI)Ga] (I, BDI={HC(C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3))2}&#8722;) by formal oxidative addition of a Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centre. Dissociation of the labile TMEDA ligand in the resulting complex [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (1) facilitates insertion of a second equiv. of I into the remaining Zn&#8722;H to form a thermally sensitive trinuclear species [{(BDI)Ga(H)}2Zn] (2). Compound 1 exchanges with polymeric zinc dideuteride [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA, and with compounds I and 2 via sequential and reversible ligand dissociation and gallium(I) insertion. Spectroscopic and computational studies demonstrate the reversibility of oxidative addition of each Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centres.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc dihydride reacts with a gallium(I) reagent by reversible oxidative addition to provide di- and trimetallic hydridogallyl zinc complexes. The position of oxidative addition-reductive elimination equilibria can be controlled by coordination/decoordination of TMEDA.
&lt;/p&gt;

From traditional to sustainable: Catalysts with platinum&#8208;group metals are well&#8208;established in the field of hydroboration of C&#8722;C multiple bonds. However, the current mantra in catalysis is to employ &#8220;cheap metals for noble tasks&#8221;. In this regard, we have developed a bis(phosphino)carbazolido magnesium&#8208;methyl complex as a catalyst for the hydroboration of alkenes, alkynes, and biologically essential terpenes by using pinacolborane (HBpin) as a hydride donor.

Abstract
Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70&#8197;years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This Review highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the action of a strong Lewis acid, isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, is triggered, which in turn directly attacks an aromatic species in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.







Abstract
Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical SEAr mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H/E (E=electrophile) substitution under formal H+ elimination. Herein, we report an unusual variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)3, is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C6F5)3) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the SEAr mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.

         <title>Bismuth Gadolinium Oxychloride with a Remarkable Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive O2 Evolution Activity Promoted by Iodine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl with a significantly promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2&#8208;evolving performance of 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm is reported. The incorporation of I&#8722; ions causes the extended light absorption and promoted charge separation.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&#8722; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay. The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8722; ion and IrO2 loaded 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2 evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The synthetic iodine&#8208;doped photocatalyst remains stable after long&#8208;term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of Alkali&#8208;Treated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of OH&#8722; and Metal Cations for Almost 100&#8201;% Selectivity of CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for alkali&#8208;treated photocatalyst in CO2 photoreduction is studied, especially for demonstrating the role of OH&#8722; and metal cations in detail for highly selective production of CO. DFT calculations confirmed that K ions enhance the charge density of nearby atoms to stabilize CO* groups and reduce the reaction energy barrier, inducing the switch of CH4 to CO.







Abstract
In this work, the modulation of activity and selectivity via photoreduction of carbon dioxide under simulated sunlight was achieved by treating P25 and P25/Pt NPs with KOH. It found that KOH treatment could significantly improve the overall conversion efficiency and switch the selectivity for CO. Photoelectric characterizations and CO2&#8208;TPD demonstrated that the synergistic effect of K+ and OH&#8208; accelerated the separation and migration of photogenerated charges, and also improved CO2 adsorption level. Significantly, the K ions could act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and further activation. In situ FTIR measurements and DFT calculations confirmed that K+ enhanced the charge density of adjacent atoms and stabilize CO* groups, reducing the reaction energy barrier and inducing the switching of original CH4 to CO, which played a selective regulatory role. This study provides insights into the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of alkali&#8208;treated photocatalysts and facilitates the design of efficient and product&#8208;specific photocatalysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into a sustainable and environmentally valuable technology: Benefitting from superior chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area, functional nanomaterials&#8208;based electrocathodes, nanostructured photocathodes, and semiconductor nanomaterials have been recognized as promising candidates for microbial CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals. This minireview surveys the latest advances in the rational design of nanomaterials for different types of microbial CO2 reduction systems.







Abstract
Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in the configuration and design of nanomaterials for enhancement of the bacterial adhesion and extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes, based on the modification technologies of improving chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area. Furthermore, the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface is detailed. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.

         <title>&#8220;Activated Borane&#8221; &#8211; A Porous Borane Cluster Network as an Effective Adsorbent for Removing Organic Pollutants</title>

         <dc:description>
Porous polymer: Thermolysis of nido&#8208;B10H14 and toluene at 250&#8201;&#176;C affords the novel microporous polymer named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;. Analyses suggests an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties. Activated borane displays a high surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, thermal stability under Ar up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, and sorption capacity to emerging pollutants exceeding the capacity of commercial activated carbon.







Abstract
The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) (nido&#8208;B10H14) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;) containing micropores between 1.0 and 1.5&#8197;nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (Ar, 87&#8197;K) that is thermally stable up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Solid state 1H, 11B and 13C&#8197;MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make activated borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum Dynamical simulations predict that, following UV irradiation of the Guanine&#8208;Cytosine Watson&#8208;Crick pair in chloroform, 20&#8764;50&#8201;% of the photoexcited population decays to a Gua&#8594;Cyt Charge Transfer state within 100&#8197;fs. Different solvation models were used in an attempt to define the effects modulating this population transfer and to explain why it is less effective than in the gas phase.&#8221;







Abstract
We study the ultrafast photoactivated dynamics of the hydrogen bonded dimer Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in chloroform solution, focusing on the population of the Guanine&#8594;Cytosine charge transfer state (GC&#8208;CT), an important elementary process for the photophysics and photochemistry of nucleic acids. We integrate a quantum dynamics propagation scheme, based on a linear vibronic model parameterized through time dependent density functional theory calculations, with four different solvation models, either implicit or explicit. On average, after 50&#8197;fs, 30&#8764;40&#8201;% of the bright excited state population has been transferred to GC&#8208;CT. This process is thus fast and effective, especially when transferring from the Guanine bright excited states, in line with the available experimental studies. Independent of the adopted solvation model, the population of GC&#8208;CT is however disfavoured in solution with respect to the gas phase. We show that dynamical solvation effects are responsible for this puzzling result and assess the different chemical&#8208;physical effects modulating the population of CT states on the ultrafast time&#8208;scale. We also propose some simple analyses to predict how solvent can affect the population transfer between bright and CT states, showing that the effect of the solute/solvent electrostatic interactions on the energy of the CT state can provide a rather reliable indication of its possible population.

         <title>Intermetallic Nanocrystals: Seed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Applications in Electrocatalytic Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention as electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge, although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. The seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach is a promising tool for precise control over these parameters of IMNCs.







Abstract
In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this Review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing the outcome: A silyl group at the alkyne terminal of secondary propargyl alcohols temporarily inverted the enantio&#8208;recognition of natural lipases. Using this phenomenon, the lipase/oxovanadium co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic alcohols achieved enantiodivergent production of R and S enantiomers in high yield and with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on the size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with the R enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only R enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining S enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well&#8208;known R&#8208;selective Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported R&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A = CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8208;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light modulated reversible &#8220;On&#8208;Off&#8221; transformation of arylazoheteroarene based discotics in nematic organization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core&#8208;based molecular systems appended with phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole photoswitches at the peripheral position through variable&#8208;length alkoxy chains have been designed and synthesized. The supramolecular interactions of the mesogens provided discotic nematic liquid crystalline assembly as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Spectroscopic studies confirmed the reversible photoswitching and excellent thermal stability of the photoswitched states in solution phase and thin film. Also, atomic force microscopic (AFM) and POM investigations demonstrated the morphological changes in the self&#8208;assembly induced by the photoirradiation as monitored by the changes in the height profiles and optical appearance of the textures, respectively. Remarkably, the liquid crystalline discotic molecules showed reversible &#8220;on and off states&#8221; controlled by light at ambient temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylation Polymerization for the Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;based Cross&#8208;linked Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst, combined with lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base, demonstrates its wide applicability in the direct arylation polymerization of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;thiophene heteroaryls with poly(hetero)aryl halides. With a nickel catalyst loading of 2.5 mol%, a series of twenty highly cross&#8208;linked organic polymers are obtained with 34 to 99% yields. Using mixed polytopic coupling partners allows obtaining alternating and optically active thiophene&#8208;based solids with intrinsic porosity.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Network Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited State Formation Within a Two&#8208;fold Catenated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Oxidation in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases: Insight from Theoretical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper enzymes that today comprise a large enzyme superfamily, grouped into the distinct members AA9&#8211;AA17 (with AA12 exempted). The LMPOs have the potential to facilitate the up&#8208;cycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The cellulose bio&#8208;polymer is the main component of biomass waste and comprises thus a large, unexploited resource. The LMPOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. For instance, the nature of the intermediate performing the oxidative reaction is an open question, and the same holds for the employed co&#8208;substrate. We here review theoretical investigations addressing these questions. The applied theoretical methods are usually based on quantum mechanics (QM), often combined with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Chemical Knowledge and Machine Learning for Performance Prediction of Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data&#8208;driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model&#8217;s capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cuttingedge embedding techniques and model designs in syntheses prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope that this Minireview can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is a by now consolidated organocatalytic platform for a number of synthetic (asymmetric) transformations  via  diverse reaction modes/ intermediates. In addition to the typical  umpolung  processes involving acyl anion/homoenolate equivalent species, implementation of protocols under oxidative conditions greatly expands the possibilities of this methodology. Oxidative NHC&#8208;catalysis allows for oxidative and oxygenative transformations through specific manipulations of Breslow&#8208;type species depending upon the oxidant used (external oxidant or O  2  /air), the derived NHC&#8208;bound intermediates paving the way to non&#8208;  umpolung  processes through activation of carbon atoms and heteroatoms. This review is intended to update the state of the art in oxidative NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that appeared in the literature from 2014 to present, with a strong focus to crucial intermediates and their mechanistic implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

         <dc:description>Small chiral organic molecules with CD properties are in high demanded due to their potential use in promising electronic and biological applications. Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group to corresponding phosphine oxide on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a CPL response.

The photophysical (UV/visible and emission) and chiroptical properties of these compounds were investigated in various solvents. Despite their structural similarities,  2  showed a significant CPL response compared to that of  1  , with a high dissymmetry factor for emission (|  g  lum  | = (1.3&#8210;1.9) &#215; 10  &#8722;3  ) that is attributable to structural changes in the interior of the helicene helix.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the current greatest challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of time scales in complex environments, such as the cell.&#160; Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy coupled to Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels in reporting protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed by preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host cell,  Escherichia coli  . We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cells. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable, industrially and academically relevant monophosphorus compounds are accessible directly from red phosphorus by using commonly available reagents. Only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques are needed, making this a convenient and practical methodology for the preparation of P1 compounds from elemental, red phosphorus.







Abstract
The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on indirect multistep procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (Pred). The relatively inert Pred was productively functionalised by using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208;n&#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive and commercially available, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Ultrafast Charge Transfer Population: Insights from the Quantum Dynamics of Guanine&#8208;Cytosine in Chloroform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer in solvent: Guanine is illustrated transferring an electron to cytosine in chloroform after the absorption of light. This is the first step of a deactivation pathway observed previously in experiment, which could also be operative in DNA, that was simulated here by using quantum dynamics. We investigated the role of the solvent, an effect commonly missing in these calculations, and demonstrated that it modulates the conversion from the initially excited &#960;&#960;* states, depicted by two wireframe potential energy surfaces intersecting. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;A. Green, F. Santoro, R. Improta and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201731).

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biochemical data demonstrate that 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid binds within the active site of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP199A4, but no oxidation occurs. Protein engineering and molecular dynamic simulations establish that aromatic oxidation is enabled by a subtle shift of the substrate relative to the heme, thus improving our understanding of this important reaction.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation. The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated whether the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid; however the F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign and low&#8208;cost alternative for fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;sourced polymers, chitosan has tremendous potential because of its bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. Synthetic pathways for chitosan derivatives with improved water solubility, and their associated applications, are explored. With the change in global direction towards a lower carbon economy and reduced environmental impact, fine&#8208;tuning chitosan properties is essential for a better future.







Abstract
Polymer alternatives sourced from nature have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among them, chitosan is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made in its synthetic modification by using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxy (&#8722;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8722;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remains limited and has hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This review summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan&#8216;s hydrophilicity and water solubility by using covalent modifications, namely amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also review several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, and water purification, and provide an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of both the thickness of the protective carbon layer, and the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles is driven by carbon support interactions. The iron hybrid materials (Fe3C@C/CNFAC) obtained from acid&#8208;treated carbon supports exhibit enhanced specific absorption rate values in biocompatible media.







Abstract
Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, they must be protected in order to overcome their toxicity and instability (i.&#8201;e., oxidation) under biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles, as well as the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8211;carbon interaction, mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles that exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate values.

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic chelates sometimes offer peripheral bonding for partially hydrolyzed multivalent cations clusters rather than their tight encapsulation inside the chelate &#8220;cage&#8221;. DOTA and DOTP chelates (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;(tetrayl)tetraacetic acid) and &#8208;(tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)), respectively) were used to study these chemical and structural motifs with the tetravalent cerium cation in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
The coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds were studied by using the ligands DOTA and DOTP (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of a highly ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements of the latter suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual decomposition in solution leads to the accumulation of the in&#8208;cage complexes [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in this study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the above&#8208;mentioned species, the in&#8208;cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the in&#8208;cage complexes studied herein and similar structures published previously suggests that hard&#8208;bonding cyclen&#8208;derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) is designed for sensitive and simple detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) based on a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR uses a proximity binding&#8208;induced RCA process to produce PPi and a PPi&#8208;mediated enzyme activity regulation process to retain HRP activity for signal generation. This CLIA is wash&#8208;free and can detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP down to 1&#8197;pg/mL (13&#8197;fM) with only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample.







Abstract
Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we described a chemiluminescent imaging assay (CLIA) for sensitive and convenient detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy. The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induce rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu2+, which prevented the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu+&#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H2O2. The T&#8208;EAR based CLIA showed a wide detection range from 1&#8197;pg/mL to 100&#8197;ng/mL (13&#8197;fM to 1.3&#8197;nM) with the requirement of only 0.75&#8197;&#956;L of sample. This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple wash&#8208;free operation, acceptable accuracy, and high&#8208;throughput imaging detection, displaying potential applicability in screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection.

         <title>Fabrication of Nb2O5/Carbon Submicrostructures for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb2O5/Carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by using a solvothermal method followed by a calcination process. As lithium ion batterie anodes, the Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance. The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity.







Abstract
Nb2O5 possesses superior fast Li+ storage capability for LIB anodes, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb2O5 restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb2O5/carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332&#8197;(194)&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;(5)&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5 nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C composite can protect Nb2O5 nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb2O5/C submicrostructures with superior Li+ storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.

As lithium ion batterie anodes, the Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance. The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures, in which Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C composite can protect Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; possesses superior fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage capability for LIB anodes, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon (C) submicrostructures are fabricated by solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332&#8197;(194)&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;(5)&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures, in which Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C composite can protect Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/C submicrostructures with superior Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Three&#8208;component, solvent&#8208;dependent,  Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed reaction of benzaldehydes, silyl enolates and arene nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of potential drug candidate 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;indanones. This reaction features three C&#8211;C bond formation, high regioselectivity under one&#8208;pot strategy, broad substrate generality, facile scalability (1.04 gm), high functional group tolerance and viable substrates. The  in situ  generated &#946;&#8208;  O  &#8208;silyl ethers from Mukaiyama aldol reaction subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed benzylic arylation with strong as well as weak nucleophiles and the resultant &#946;  ,  &#946;&#8208;di&#8208;aryl esters can undergo the third C&#9472;C bond formation with excellent regioselectivity  via  intramolecular cyclization to afford the indanone products in the same pot. Detailed mechanistic insight leads to a feasible reaction pathway. This transformation opens up a practical and adaptable approach for producing a variety of synthetically valuable transformations and enable the synthesis of medicinally valuable (  R  )&#8208;Tolterodine and (+)&#8208;Indatraline.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Selectivity in Heterolanthanide Molecular Complexes with a Ditopic Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The similar reactivity of lanthanides generally leads to statistically populated polynuclear complexes, making the rational design of ordered hetero&#8208;lanthanide compounds extremely challenging. Here we report on the site selectivity&#160;in hetero&#8208;lanthanide tetranuclear complexes&#160;afforded by the relatively simple ditopic pyterpyNO ligand (4&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridil)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8221;&#8208;terpyridine  N  &#8208;oxide). The sequential room temperature reaction of RE  2  (tta)  6  (pyterpyNO)  2  (where RE= Y, (  1)  ; Eu, (  2)  , Dy, (  3)  Htta = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone) with La(tta)  3  dme (dme = dimethoxyethane) yielded Y  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  4  ), Dy  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  5  ) and Eu  2  La  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  6  ). Single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that  4, 5  and  6  are isostructural, featuring a tetranuclear structure with two different metal coordination sites with coordination numbers 8 (CN8) and 9 (CN9). The two smaller cations are mainly bridged by the  O  &#8208; donor atoms of the NO groups of two pyterpyNO ligands (CN8), while the larger lanthanum centres are bound by a terpyridine unit (CN9). Size selectivity has been studied with structural and magnetic studies in the solid state and through  19  F&#8208;NMR and photoluminescence studies in solution, showing a direct dependence on the difference of ionic radii of the ions and yielding a 91% selectivity for  4  . Furthermore,  19  F&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray and PL studies pointed out that the nature of the product is independent from the synthetic route for compound Eu  2  Y  2  (tta)  12  (pyterpyNO)  2  (  7  ), keeping the ion selectivity also for a self&#8208;assembly reaction. Unexpectedly, these studies have evidenced that selectivity is not exclusively governed by electrostatic interactions related to size dimensions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition: A Highly Efficient Synthesis of Customized Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of the P&#8208;H bond in bis(mesitoyl)phosphine, HP(COMes)  2  (BAPH), to a wide variety of activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds as acceptors was investigated. While this Phospha&#8208;Michael addition does not proceed in the absence of an additive or catalyst, excellent results were obtained with stoichiometric basic potassium or caesium salts. Simple amine bases can be employed in catalytic amounts and especially tetramethylguanidine (TMG) is an outstanding catalyst which allows to prepare bis(acyl)phosphines, R&#8208;P(COMes)  2  , under very mild conditions in excellent yields in short time. All phosphines RP(COMes)  2  can subsequently be oxidized to the corresponding bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, RPO(COMes)  2  , a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators for radical polymerisations known to date. Thereby a simple and highly atom economic method was found, which allows to prepare a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Divergent Lithiation of 2,3&#8208;Dihalopyridines, Deprotolithiation versus Halogen Dance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein the first Halogen Dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by trapping selectively (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo halogen dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process has been extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines using various electrophiles to afford 25 examples with yields ranging from 42% to 97% with very short residence times. Finally, the scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2 kg.h  &#8208;1  .L  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Although osmabenzyne, osmanaphthalyne, osmaphenanthryne, and osmaanthracyne have been previously reported,  the synthesis of polycyclic  osmaarynes is still a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of the first pentacyclic osmaarynes (pyreno[  b  ]osmabenzyne  1a  and  2a  ) and hexacyclic osmaaryne (peryleno[  b  ]osmabenzyne  3a  ). The nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding pyreno[  b  ]osmium complexes (  1  and  2  ) and peryleno[  b  ] osmium complex (  3  ), which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Complexes  2  and  3  have photodegradation resistance, and complex  2  has better photothermal conversion properties when compared with  3  .</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(I)&#8208;thiolate nanosheets with closely&#8208;packed multiple surface functional groups have been synthesized via a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;assembly strategy. The easy but powerful strategy addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which shows promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl4 together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and paves the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations by Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New way to drive photoredox catalysis: Highly chemoselective photooxidations of benzylic alcohols to carbonyl compounds in the presence of various easily&#8208;oxidizable groups are possible in a simple oxygen&#8208;free system consisting of a substrate, unique deazaflavinium catalyst and acetonitrile which acts simultaneously as a sacrificial electron acceptor and solvent.







Abstract
Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208;whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, and on anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70&#8201;%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8211;100&#8201;% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98&#8201;% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;Vis spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed that the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile under formation of solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.

         <title>Highly Efficient Au(I) Alkynyl Emitters: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new alkynyl Au(I) carbene complex with tunable electronic structure shows high efficiency thermally activated fluorescence (TADF). Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs made with these complexes achieve high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 20.4&#8201;%, manifesting the bright prospect of Au(I)&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type coinage metal complexes displaying efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been unveiled to be highly appealing candidates as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein a series of green to yellow TADF gold(I) complexes with alkynyl ligands has been developed for the first time. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.76 in doped films (5&#8197;wt&#8201;% in PMMA) at room temperature. The modifications of alkynyl ligands with electron&#8208;donating amino groups together with the use of electron&#8208;deficient carbene ligands induce ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states that give rise to TADF emission. Spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the roles of electron&#8208;donating capability of the alkynyl ligand in tuning the excited&#8208;state properties. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the present complexes as emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radioactive Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories can be immobilized by reduction of the highly soluble TcO4&#8722; anion by agents like magnetite (Fe3O4) and H2, which create an amorphous TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O precipitate. EXAFS measurements combined with DFT calculations reveal that the precipitate is an inorganic polymer formed of zigzag TcO2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O chains and give evidence of an increasing polymerization over time. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;F. Oliveira, A.&#8197;C. Scheinost, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202235).

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules have found a plethora of important applications in many research fields. Consequently, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these unique skeletons have drawn a lot of research interests and achieved notable advances in the last two decades. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the progresses in this field, including methods enabled by both asymmetric transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules, usually containing multiple ortho&#8208;fused aromatic rings, possess unique helical chirality. These compounds have found a wide range of important applications in many research fields, such as asymmetric catalysis, molecular recognition, sensors and responsive switches, circularly polarized luminescence materials and others. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes was largely underexplored, when compared with the enantioselective synthesis of molecules bearing other stereogenic elements (e.g. central chirality and axial chirality). Since the pioneer work of asymmetric synthesis of helicenes via enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes by Star&#225; and Star&#253;, last two decades have witnessed the tremendous development in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the advances in this field, which include methods enabled by both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, and provide our perspective on its future development.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Carbon Dots in Bi&#8208;Solvent Systems Triggered by Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in bi&#8208;solvent systems has been demonstrated as an unprecedented strategy to realize circularly polarized luminescence of achiral carbon dots. Dissymmetry factors of 10&#8722;3 are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality.







Abstract
An innovative strategy for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of carbon dots (CDs) has been developed: The achiral CDs displayed contrary supramolecular chirality and opposite CPL in two different bi&#8208;solvent systems, which are due to the formation of self&#8208;assembled helical nanostructures with two diverse assembly modes (P and M) in aggregate state via intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and differential hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) without the need of any additional element of chirality.

         <title>A Symmetrically &#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazole Incorporating Fluoranthene Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building big. A symmetrically &#960;&#8208;expanded carbazole incorporating fluoranthene moieties was assembled through a five&#8208;step synthetic route. In comparison to parent N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted carbazole the compound features significantly bathochromically shifted UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission maxima with considerably increased photoluminescence quantum yield. The &#960;&#8208;expansion results in facilitated oxidation with improved reversibility, while at the same time, the aromaticity of the central carbazole moiety remains unaffected.







Abstract
A novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine) is disclosed. The carbazole moiety is generated in the final step through intramolecular oxidative coupling. The &#960;&#8208;expansion of carbazole resulted in strongly altered optoelectronic and electrochemical properties. The solid&#8208;state structure features an interesting packing motif with alternating face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of the interhelical self&#8208;assembly from enantiophilic to enantiophobic takes place by reduction of the alkyl chain length and leads to a phase transition from the achiral double gyroid via a tetragonal phase to a chiral triple network phase, associated with a transition from an achiral to a mirror symmetry broken liquid.







Abstract
Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single n&#8208;alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso1[*]) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral I23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with I23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tetbi) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network meso&#8208;structure with Ia
d space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso1) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.

Low coordination number yet stable: The synthesis and characterisation of new low&#8208;valent palladium (0) complexes are reported, and provide simple access to known and novel complexes, the instrinsic reactivity of which prevented their isolation using existing methods. One complex performs exceptionally well as a catalyst in the hydrosilylation reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] complexes are reported. These new 14&#8208;electron Pd(0)&#8208;complexes are key synthons leading to known palladium(0) and palladium(II) species, as well as permitting access to unprecedented mixed NHC&#8208;phosphite palladium(0) complexes. This motif permits the facile catalytic hydrosilylation of allenes. DFT calculations have allowed the characterization of the relatively weak interaction between the metal and the diphenylacetylene ligand, with a comparison with a series of ligands with more or less coordinating power, bearing varied structural and electronic properties.

         <title>Merging Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H Functionalization and Cascade Cyclization to Enable Propargylic Alcohols as Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a reactivity of propargyl alcohols as &#8220;Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons&#8221; in a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization of acetanilides, leading to the synthesis of core structures of isocryptolepine, &#947;&#8722;carbolines, dihydrochromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles, and diindolylmethanes (DIM) derivatives. The transformation involves a rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization and heteroannulation to yield indoles followed by a cascade cyclization with both external and internal nucleophiles to afford diverse products. The role of the hydroxy group, the key function of the silver additive, the origin of the reverse regioselectivity and the rate&#8208;determining step, are rationalized in conformity with the combination of experimental, noncovalent interaction analysis and DFT studies. This protocol is endowed with several salient features, including one&#8208;pot multistep cascade approach, exclusive regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance and synthesis of variety of molecular frameworks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the central role of aromaticity in the chemistry of expanded porphyrins, the evaluation of aromaticity remains difficult for these extended macrocycles. The presence of multiple conjugation pathways and different planar and nonplanar&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugation topologies makes the quantification of global and local aromaticity even more challenging. In neutral expanded porphyrins, it is established the predominance of the aromatic conjugation pathway passing through the imine&#8208;type nitrogens and circumventing the amino NH groups. However, for charged macrocycles, the question about the main conjugation circuit remains open. Accordingly, different conjugation pathways in a set of neutral, anionic, and cationic expanded porphyrins were investigated by means of several aromaticity indices rooted in the structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. Overall, our results reveal the predominance of the conjugation pathway that passes through all nitrogen atoms in all five&#8208;membered rings to describe the aromaticity of deprotonated expanded porphyrins, while the outer pathway through the perimeter carbon atoms becomes the most aromatic in protonated macrocycles. In nonplanar and charged macrocycles, a discrepancy between electronic and magnetic descriptors is observed. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates AV  min  &#160;remains the best tool to determine the main conjugation pathway of expanded porphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Design concepts for solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; a modern viewpoint on classical and non&#8208;classical approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8209;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by the CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive and shows interesting features both in terms of cost&#8208;effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active by using the low catalytic loading of 1% mol and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed its recycle for three consecutive times without any decrease of performances. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines yielding oxazolidinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles catalyzed by NNP&#8208;Manganese(I) pincer complexes at ambient temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have aroused widespread interest in recent years. Among the catalytic systems described, especially PNP&#8208; and NNP&#8208;Mn pincer catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, aldimines and esters. Furthermore, NNP&#8208;Mn pincer compounds are efficient catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of less reactive amides, ureas, carbonates, and carbamates. Here, we describe the synthesis and application of specific imidazolylaminophosphine ligands and the corresponding Mn pincer complexes. These new catalysts have been characterized and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations, and their catalytic activities have been tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed under very mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used in metal halide perovskites. Due to their variable anion structures, similar family relations are still largely missing in group 15 halogenido metalates. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2 n I6 n +4]4&#8722;&#8208;family of anions, including the first n = 5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz = pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n = 1 &#8211; 5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72 eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8208; unit as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, providing a framework for understanding new and literature&#8208;known compounds in this emerging class of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Stannylenoids Stabilized by Amido/Imino Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction&#160;of the lithium aryl(silyl)amide Dipp(iPr3Si)NLi (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with one equivalent of SnCl2&#160;in THF gave a novel stannylenoid Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl&#8729;LiCl(THF)2. Heating up the solution of the amidostannylenoid in toluene at 80&#160;oC resulted in the dimeric amido(chloro)stannylene [Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl]2, which can be converted to the bis(amido)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)]2&#160;and amido(imino)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)][IPrN] (IPrN = bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino). Treatment of bis(imino)stannylenoid [IPrN]2Sn(Cl)Li with N2O resulted in the dimeric complex [IPrNSn(Cl)OLi]2. All compounds were characterized by NMR, elementary analysis, and X&#8208;ray structural determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the glmS ribozymes from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  glmS  ribozyme regulates the expression of the essential GlmS enzyme being involved in cell wall biosynthesis. While &gt; 450 variants of the  glmS  ribozyme were identified by  in silico  approaches and homology searches, only a few have yet been experimentally investigated. Herein, we validate and characterize the  glmS  ribozymes of the human pathogens  Clostridium difficile  and  Listeria monocytogenes  . Both ribozymes, as their previous characterized homologs rely on glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate as co&#8208;factor and the presence of divalent cations for exerting the cleavage reaction. The observed EC  50  values in turn were found to be in the submicromolar range, at least an order of magnitude lower than observed for  glmS  ribozymes from other bacteria. The  glmS  ribozyme of  L. monocytogenes  was further shown to bear unique properties. It discriminates between co&#8208;factors very stringently and other than the  glmS  ribozyme of  C. difficile  retains activity at low temperatures. This finding illustrates that albeit being highly conserved,  glmS  ribozymes have unique characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endoperoxides Compounds for Highly Efficient Cancer Treatment under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment has garnered great attention, with promising non&#8208;invasiveness, low side effects, and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumours remains a serious resistant factor to limit PDT effects.  Endoperoxides  are always utilized as chemical storage or supplier of singlet oxygen  (  1  O  2  ), the active substance for PDT in materials and other domains. Recent reports indicated that this type of compounds could remarkably enhance the therapeutic effects of PDT under hypoxia. This concept mainly introduces a few representative endoperoxides and outlook of their potent application for the treatment of hypoxic cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallic Catalysts for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Using CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO  2  (CO  2  &#8208;ODP) is a promising technique for realizing high&#8208;yield propylene production and CO  2  usage. Developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO  2  &#8208;ODP is essential and beneficial to the chemical industry and for realizing net&#8208;zero emissions. Many studies have investigated metal oxide&#8208;based catalysts, revealing that rapid deactivation and low selectivity remain limiting factors for their industrial applications. In recent years, metallic nanoparticle catalysts have become increasingly attractive due to their unique properties. Therefore, we summarize the performance of metal&#8208;based catalysts in CO  2  &#8208;ODP reactions by considering catalyst design concepts, different mechanisms in the reaction process, and the role of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversibly Porous Supramolecular Peptide Framework
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building&#8208;blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system.







Abstract
The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of an exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metal&#8208;peptide frameworks.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards ultrasensitive SERS analysis: Magneto&#8208;plasmonic dendrimer&#8208;based colloids have been explored for the adsorption and SERS detection of contaminants in water quality monitoring assisted by magnetic separation. Three chemical routes &#8211; crosslinking, chemical grafting, and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly &#8211; led to hybrid nanostructures with distinct potentialities.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Towards ultrasensitive SERS analysis&lt;/b&gt;: Magneto-plasmonic dendrimer-based colloids have been explored for the adsorption and SERS detection of contaminants in water quality monitoring assisted by magnetic separation. Three chemical routes &#8211; crosslinking, chemical grafting, and layer-by-layer assembly &#8211; led to hybrid nanostructures with distinct potentialities.

         <dc:description>
Zn&#8211;air batteries: The development of TMS catalysts and their applications in ZABs is discussed. We focus on the means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of TMS, such as defect introduction, interface engineering, and structural regulation. Finally, some challenges and opportunities in TMS electrocatalysis research are briefly presented, and strategies for improving the performance of ZABs are prospected.







Abstract
Go electro! The means of improving the electrocatalytic performance of transition&#8208;metal sulfides (TMS) and ideas for the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts, including structure engineering, interface engineering, defect engineering, etc&#8222; are discussed in this work. In addition, the performance improvement law between catalyst performance and ZABs and the development direction and prospects of designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts based on TMS are also discussed.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate Dissolution from the Laboratory to the Ocean: Kinetics and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate chemistry: Although calcite dissolution has been extensively studied there appears to be a problem; apparent contradictions, discrepancies between laboratories and inconsistencies with field measurements seemingly pervade the literature. This review highlights how &#8211; in some circumstances &#8211; a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hindered development.







Abstract
The ultimate fate, over the course of millennia, of nearly all of the carbon dioxide formed by humankind is for it to react with calcium carbonate in the world's oceans. Although, this reaction is of global relevance, aspects of the calcite dissolution reaction remain poorly described with apparent contradictions present throughout the expansive literature. In this perspective we aim to evidence how a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hampered developments in this area. These insights have important implications for both idealised experiments performed under laboratory conditions and for the measurement and modelling of oceanic calcite sediment dissolution.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios and fast spin relaxation complicate their observations. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201490), R.&#8197;P. Martinho and L. Frydman explore indirect ways for detecting these sites with the help of proton detection, amplified by chemical exchanges with the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications are mediated by spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons, opening new avenues in spectroscopic MRI.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Epoxy/Surface Adhesion: Understanding the Interphase Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy resin coatings are commonly used to protect metal surfaces from corrosion. Molecular simulations are used to investigate the adhesion in an epoxy resin precursor to hematite and goethite surfaces, as a proxy for steel surfaces and the effect of water ingress. For hematite water always decreases the adhesion whilst for goethite a small amount of water increases adhesion to the surface.







Abstract
Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions. In this work, the interphase region of an epoxy precursor and metal oxide substrates is investigated using molecular simulations and it is found that water accumulates between the epoxy layer and the solid substrate. At high water concentrations (9&#8197;wt&#8201;%) the interaction between the epoxy precursor and the solid surface is weakened regardless of the nature of the solid, but at low water concentrations the nature of the solid surface becomes important. For hematite, the presence of water decreases the strength of adhesion but for goethite the presence of a small amount of water (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the adhesion to the surface resulting in a densification at the interface.

         <title>Templated Generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitor by Isomer&#8208;Free SPAAC Based on Azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>

Less strain, more gain. We present Fmoc&#8208;ACN as the first cyclononyne suitable for isomer&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC). We demonstrate its use for the rational design and protein&#8208;templated formation of a low&#8208;micromolar inhibitor of protein&#8211;protein interactions mediated by Bcl&#8208;xL. The lower intrinsic reactivity of cyclononynes as compared to cyclooctynes facilitated higher template effects and rate accelerations in the aqueous environment.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8211;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in aqueous environments.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Tailoring To Construct Ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) Nanosheets: Interactive CO2RR Promotion and Bismuth&#8208;Oxygen Moiety Preservation</title>

         <dc:description>
Special morphology: Ultrathin Bi2O2O surface/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) substrate nanosheets were prepared through in&#8208;situ interlamellar hydrogen&#8208;bond tailoring strategies. The special morphology not only helps to facilitate production of the Bi2O2CO3 intermediate, but also enhances the resistance of Bi&#8722;O moieties to being reduced to promote formate production from CO2RR.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to produce formate; however, preserving bismuth&#8208;oxygen moieties while applying a cathodic potential is challenging. This work reports the preparation of ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) nanosheets (BiON&#8208;uts) by in&#8208;situ tailoring of hydrogen bonds in a Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) precursor. The BiON&#8208;uts exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 98&#8201;% with higher partial current density than that of most reported bismuth&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange between BiON&#8208;uts and the electrolyte to produce Bi2O2CO3 as intermediate, and adsorption of CO2 with surface Bi2O2O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi2O2CO3. More importantly, high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO2RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO2RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Revealing the Effect of Surface Composition on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Supported Pt&#8208;Fe Alloy Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation: This work have been successfully fabricated property Pt&#8722;Fe alloy supported on the MWCNTs featuring nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The resulting structure is a highly active methanol oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe3+ feeding content (0.86&#8197;mA/mgPt) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38&#8197;mA/mgPt). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71&#8197;V and 0.80&#8197;V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.

         <title>Solution Structure of a Lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA Aptamer Determined Using High Quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range paramagnetic NMR restraints remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acid systems. In this contribution we demonstrate that such restraints can be generated by a lanthanide ion bound to an intrinsic site provided by a DNA aptamer. By solving the 3D structure of the aptamer&#8208;Ln3+ complex we provide the structural basis for the introduction of similar sites into other DNA systems.







Abstract
In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.

Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNA) and hydrophobin proteins. including SC3, sheding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cell wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials for iodine capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively.  Cluster&#8208;based  crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications.  Herein, this paper reviews the recent progress of  different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture. The research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8211;azobenzene&#8211;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2  , to afford SP with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene&#8208; monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong inter&#8208;molecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SP, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SP.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Homo/Mixed Valence Ag12, Ag29, and Ag8 Clusters Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbene&#8208;Anchored Monoanionic Phosphorus Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver (Ag) clusters are attractive candidates for their promising optical properties and biomedical activities. Herein, we report on the first syntheses, and isolation of the three mixed valence silver NCs with Ag  12  Cl  3  , Ag  29  , and Ag  8  cores [((cAAC)P)  6  Ag  12  Cl  3  ](OTf)  3  (  1  ), [((cAAC)P)  6  Ag  29  ] (  2  ), and &#160;[((cAAC)P)  4  Ag  8  ] (  3  ) having three/two&#8208;fold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenides (cAACP  &#8722;  ) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of the two Ag NC (  1  ,  2  ) are approximately of 1.6 to 2 nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P  &#8722;  ) anchored with cAAC ligands are  in situ  generated by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P  &#8208;  B(N  i  Pr  2  )  2  via the cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of triflate anion (OTf  &#8722;  ) as a weak nucleophile. The equivalent numbers of the  in situ  generated (cAAC)P  &#8722;  anions are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)  2  P  2  , leading to the generation of Ag(0) ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed valence Ag NC  2  . Complex  3  is achieved by the reaction of potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf  2  .The ligand field, and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play a crucial role for stabilization of the complexes  1  &#8208;  2  , further providing a three&#8208;fold stand. The Ag  12  Cl  3  NC  1  with tri&#8208;cationic core [Ag(I)  12  Cl  3  ] is found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563 nm when excited at 400 nm. Whereas, the neutral Ag  29  (  2  ), and Ag  8  (  3  ) clusters are found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag(0) at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)  6  as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources.&#160;Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A study on the reactivity of several N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and the cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene cAACMe (1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with the tetrel hydrides GeH2Mes2 and SnH2Me2 (Me = CH3, Mes = 1,3,5&#8208;(CH3)3C6H2) is presented. The reaction of GeH2Mes2 with cAACMe led to the insertion of cAACMe into one Ge&#8211;H bond to give cAACMeH&#8211;GeHMes2 (1).

The reaction of SnH2Me2 with cAACMe also afforded the insertion product cAACMeH&#8211;SnHMe2 (3), the reaction of two equivalents Me2ImMe with SnH2Me2 gave the NHC&#8208;stabilized stannylene Me2ImMe&#8729;SnMe2 (4).

         <title>Stacking Interactions: a Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>

         <dc:description>The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8226;ArX (ArX = PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  Cl, 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  Br, 4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br  2  C  6  H  4  ) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8943;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8943;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8943;N  cyano  halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5 kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)  2  &#8226;4&#8208;MeOC  6  H  4  Cl (12.5 kcal/mol).

         <title>Multiply Twisted Chiral Macrocycles Clamped by Tethered Binaphthyls Exhibiting High Circularly Polarized Luminescence Brightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral macrocycles with multiple twisted structures have been synthesized as emissive chiroptical dyes by anchoring tethered chiral binaphthyls. The rigid molecular structure exhibits a high gCPL and quantum yield, leading to a high CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Chiral macrocyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers composed of paraphenylene and tethered binaphthyl were synthesized, and their molecular structures and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that multiple twisted molecular structures &#8211; dimers, trimers, and tetramers &#8211; adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight, M&#246;bius triangle, and concave rectangle structures, respectively. These homologues have large &#1013; values in their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra because of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the naphthalene&#8208;phenylene&#8208;naphthalene frameworks. Owing to the shape&#8208;persistent ring structure and tethering with &#8722;OCH2CH2O&#8722;, high fluorescence quantum yields and a relatively high dissymmetry factor gCPL in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were achieved. This results in CPL brightness (BCPL) of over 100, which is greater than that of the conventional organic CPL dye.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control of Molecular Photoluminescent Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time is more! A review of how molecular emissive properties can be controlled in a dynamic time&#8208;dependent manner to give compounds that show great potential for designing smart luminescent materials with time&#8208;encoding features.







Abstract
Dynamic control of molecular photoluminescence offers chemical solutions to designing functional emissive materials. Although stimuli&#8208;switchable molecular luminescent systems are well established, how to encode these dynamic emissive systems with a &#8220;timing&#8221; feature, that is, time&#8208;dependent luminescent properties, remains challenging. This Concept aims to summarize the design principles of dynamic timing molecular photoluminescent systems by discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of this topic and the shaping of fabrication strategies at both the molecular and supramolecular levels. An outlook and perspectives are given to outline the future opportunities and challenges in the rational design and potential applications of these smart emissive systems.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel nanoparticles of controlled arrangements of interacting enzymes can be produced intracellularly, purified from crude bacterial lysates in a one&#8208;step process, and used as stable materials in flow&#8208;through biocatalysis.







Abstract
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an Escherichia coli&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the Lactobacillus brevis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the Bacillus subtilis glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow biocatalysis, by which flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4&#8197;days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;Conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stabilizer&#8208;containing multifunctional molecules has been developed and evaluated in expansion microscopy. These multifunctional molecules not only enable effective protection of dyes from radicals during polymerization, but also improve photostability while showing no negative impact on polymerization.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer&#8208;containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical&#8208;induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point, we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore&#8208;conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer&#8208;modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes that gather strong photo&#8208;oxidizing power and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption were prepared with the highly conjugated dph or bpph ligands. Biolayer interferometry and NCI Surface analyses show their avid binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA particularly arising from interaction within the G&#8208;quadruplex groove.







Abstract
Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible&#8208;light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible&#8208;light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible&#8208;light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures from the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed us to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.

     alt="Photo-Oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible-Light Absorption and G-quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ru(II) complexes&lt;/b&gt; that gather strong photo-oxidizing power and enhanced visible-light absorption were prepared with the highly conjugated dph or bpph ligands. Biolayer interferometry and NCI Surface analyses show their avid binding to G-quadruplex DNA particularly arising from interaction within the G-quadruplex groove.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosensitizers that gather high photo-oxidizing power and strong visible-light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo-chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible-light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible-light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G-quadruplex DNA structures from the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G-quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio-layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non-canonical G-quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non-covalent ionic analysis allowed us to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G-quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non-chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,2,5&#8208;Triarylcycloalka[c]arsoles: Structural Effects of Fused&#8208;cycloalkanes on Stability and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentane&#8208; and cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsoles were also synthesized. While the former was stable, the latter gradually decomposed to the corresponding diketone under ambient conditions owing to its frustrated structure. The frustration of the fused cyclohexane also caused large structural relaxation, resulting in a relatively large Stokes shift.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole 2&#8201;a gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused 1&#8201;a was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of 2&#8201;a (7766&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is larger than that of 1&#8201;a (5120&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in 2&#8201;a was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in 1&#8201;a was much less distorted.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core&#8208;based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is an efficient way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as  TDBFSBF1  and  TDBFSBF2  were effectively developed.  TDBFSBF1  exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178 &#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5 eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0%, long operational lifetime at 50% of the initial luminance of 89,000 h, and low driving voltage at 1000 cd m  &#8722;2  of 2.95 V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using  TDBFSBF1  . Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#181;  h  value of 1.9 &#180; 10  &#8722;3  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  was recorded in  TDBFSBF2  . A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#181;  h  values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core&#8208;based HTLs.</dc:description>

         <title>s&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8211;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two s&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, &#160;with the more electropositive s&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8211;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive s&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8211;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8211;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208; Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.</dc:description>

The third dimension of arynes. Synthetic equivalents of enantiopure bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL can be generated and reacted in solution with various arynophiles for the fully enantiospecific syntheses of congested large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon atropisomers.







Abstract
The synthetic equivalents of the enantiopure binaphthyl bis(aryne) atropisomers derived from BINOL (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;naphtol) featuring a stereogenic axis vicinal to the two reactive triple bonds can be generated for the first time in solution in an enantiospecific manner. Using a two&#8208;step sequence based on the bidirectional [4+2] cycloaddition of furan derivatives followed by an aromatizative deoxygenation reaction, several 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bianthracenyl&#8208;based atropisomers could be prepared enantiospecifically in high enantiomeric purity. Alternatively, bidirectional reactions with anthracene, 2&#8208;bromostyrene, and perylene as the arynophiles afforded very congested bis(benzotriptycene), bis(tetraphene) and bis(anthra[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene) nanocarbon atropisomers in equally high enantiomeric purity. In complement, cross reactions with two different arynophiles revealed possible. The unusual atropisomer prototypes described in this study open the way to enantiopure nanographene atropisomers designed for functions.

         <title>2D Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction: Discussing Structure Efficiency Strategies and Prospects for Scaled Production Based on Current Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D view of photocatalysis: This review discusses 2D materials with excellent performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, summarizes existing synthetic strategies, and highlights promising batch preparation strategies. Second, our work summarizes the existing applications and modification strategies of various 2D materials in the field of CO2 emission reduction.







Abstract
Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO2, leading to severe energy shortages and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and use renewable clean energy while reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to their structure and performance is emphasized. Finally, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO2 with high efficiency, even for practical applications are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBA&#8208;15 with metal based quaternary ammonium salt was used for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. Ionic liquids grafting into the pore channel of SBA&#8208;15 provide an alternative chance to improve the catalytic performance at 1.5&#8197;MPa and 90 &#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of a new type of catalyst, SBA&#8722;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction, is described. Various amounts of ionic liquid were grafted into the pore channels of SBA&#8208;15 using the post&#8208;grafting method, which allowed the ionic liquid to be grafted into the pore channels restrictively. Notably, over six cycles, SBA&#8722;Mn (0.2) has been shown to maintain its catalytic activity and stability. In addition, a reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides based on density&#8208;functional theory is proposed. The cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. It is demonstrated that the metal coordinated with the oxygen atom of the epoxides and that a halogen attacked the carbon of epoxides. Moreover, theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy provide a new approach for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Cytochrome Involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; Electron Harvesting Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The periplasmic cytochrome GSU2515 is crucial for the electron harvesting pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens, a suitable bacterium to apply in microbial electrosynthesis technologies. The biophysical characterization of GSU2515 together with biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments highlighted how electrons are conducted within the periplasm and pave the way for understanding the bacterium's electron harvesting pathways.







Abstract
Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligands in the reduced and oxidized states, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8722;78&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;6 and &#8722;113&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlight for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.

         <title>Immobilization of AgCl/Pd Heterojunctions on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes: Interfacial Design&#8208;Induced Electronic Regulation Enhances Photocatalytic Activity</title>

From amine to imine more easily: A fan&#8208;like hollow N&#8208;doped C&#8208;coated AgCl/Pd heterostructure has been synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor under argon. The interface effect of the AgCl/Pd heterostructure efficiently regulates the electronic structure and accelerates the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity toward oxidative coupling of amine to imine.







Abstract
Rationally designing interface structure to modulate the electronic structure of a photocatalyst is an efficient strategy to facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers and improve photocatalytic activity. In this work, a AgCl/Pd heterostructure encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (AgCl/Pd@N&#8722;C) with a fan&#8208;like morphology assembled hollow tubes was synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor. The unique interface structure not only increases the number of photogenerated charge carriers, but also provides an effective channel for the separation of electrons and holes, which have been proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As expected, the obtained AgCl/Pd&#8208;3@N&#8722;C exhibited greatly enhanced conversion efficiency and recyclability toward the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amine under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Terpyridine Diphosphine Ruthenium Complexes as Efficient Photocatalysts for the Transfer Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new cationic ruthenium [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]X (X=Cl, PF6) complexes, prepared from [RuCl2(PPh3)3] a diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy), promote the photocatalytical transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds in 2&#8208;propanol under mild conditions. Unprecedented asymmetric catalytic TH of acetophenone driven by light was obtained with ruthenium tpy complexes containing the chiral Skewphos diphosphine.







Abstract
The cationic achiral and chiral terpyridine diphosphine ruthenium complexes [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]Cl (PP=dppp (1), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3)) are easily obtained in 85&#8211;88&#8201;% yield through a one&#8208;pot synthesis from [RuCl2(PPh3)3], the diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) in 1&#8208;butanol. Treatment of 1&#8211;3 with NaPF6 in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=dppp (1&#8201;a), (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos (2&#8201;a) and (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos (3&#8201;a)). Reaction of [RuCl2(PPh3)3] with (S,R)&#8208;Josiphos or (R)&#8208;BINAP in toluene, followed by treatment with tpy in 1&#8208;butanol and finally with NaPF6 in MeOH gives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF6 (PP=(S,R)&#8208;Josiphos (4&#8201;a), (R)&#8208;BINAP (5&#8201;a)) isolated in 78&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% yield, respectively. The chiral derivatives have been isolated as single stereoisomers and 3&#8201;a, 4&#8201;a have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The tpy complexes with NaOiPr display high photocatalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds using 2&#8208;propanol as the only hydrogen donor and visible light at 30&#8201;&#176;C, at remarkably high S/C (up to 5000) and TOF values up to 264&#8197;h&#8722;1. The chiral enantiomers 2, 2&#8201;a and 3, 3&#8201;a induce the asymmetric photocatalytic TH of acetophenone, affording (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol with 51 and 52&#8201;% ee, respectively, in a MeOH/2&#8208;propanol mixture.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The new cationic ruthenium [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]X (X=Cl, PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) complexes&lt;/b&gt;, prepared from [RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] a diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;-terpyridine (tpy), promote the photocatalytical transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds in 2-propanol under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The cationic achiral and chiral terpyridine diphosphine ruthenium complexes [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]Cl (PP=dppp (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Skewphos (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Skewphos (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;)) are easily obtained in 85&#8211;88&#8201;% yield through a one-pot synthesis from [RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], the diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;-terpyridine (tpy) in 1-butanol. Treatment of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with NaPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (PP=dppp (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Skewphos (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Skewphos (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;)).

Computational insights on reactivity: The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation is investigated using DFT calculations. The computed mechanism involves a dinuclear side&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxo dicopper(II) adduct in equilibrium with the key oxidizing intermediate bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) species. The difference of reactivity towards internal substrates bearing activated or non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is rationalized.







Abstract
The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8722;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8722;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (L1) or non&#8208;activated (L2) C&#8722;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a side&#8208;on peroxide species (P) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (O) responsible for the C&#8722;H activation step. The P/O equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes. However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8722;H activation step, where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.
