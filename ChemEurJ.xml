         <title>Fluorenylidene&#8208;Cyclopentadithiophene&#8208;Based Asymmetric Bistricyclic Aromatic Ene Compounds: Synthesis and Substituents Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8208;OMe, &#8208;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angels around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8208;SMe group can provide additional S&#183;&#183;&#183;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8208;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8208;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution via Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to the construction of a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of supramolecular assembly composed of a [Co2Fe2] complex via a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). The [Co2Fe2] complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed the thermal ETCST. On the other hand, the thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor (HBD) caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled onedimensional (1D) chains through hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) formations.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthene Separated 24 &#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady&#8208;state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including TD&#8208;DFT, ACID, and NICS. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanometer Metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773 K, even in the presence of 0.15 mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond activation reactions (OH, NH) of stereoisomeric disilenes are often 100&#8201;% stereospecific. Although we have a good understanding of the possible reaction pathways to the isomeric products, without a deeper understanding of the influence of the geometry of the disilene and the influence of the substituents on each elementary step, it remains difficult to predict the stereochemistry of the products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100&#8201;% stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable time normalization analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04&#177;0.06 at 298&#8197;K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The formation of the donor adduct is the rate determining step. The results of this study, together with previous studies on the addition of ammonia and amines to disilenes, allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.

The Nobel Prize Nomination Archives provides the names of the nominators and their nominees for the chemistry prize from 1901 to 1970. This data gives insights into the selection of the Nobel Laureates. One of the more unusual observations is an up&#8208;down&#8208;up nomination trend for many of the chemistry laureates at the very end of their nomination profiles. Some chemistry laureates received very few nominations; and some non&#8208;laureates received many nominations. The nomination patterns are often curious and always informative.







Abstract
The solicitation of nominations for the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry (NPch) is and has been the first step in the selection process since the very first awards were made in 1901. The number of nominations solicited by and provided to the Nobel Committee for Chemistry supports the belief by the nominators that their nominations are meaningful. In this publication, we examine data culled from the Nobel Prize Nomination Archives for the period 1901&#8211;1970 of the variable role of nominations in the selection process for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The evidence is overwhelming that nominations, in general, during the 1901&#8211;1970 period have not been the deciding, overriding factor in the selection of the recipients of the NPch. Rather, we posit that nominations from the preselected nominator&#8208;pool have been a source of information for the Committee, used to suggest future years&#8217; contenders and possibly served as motivation for the Committee to seek nominations for specific nominees for future years. It is also clear that selections are often influenced by personal prejudices, for example, friendships, rivalries, and nationality.

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;Electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Two mechanisms are uncovered that control fluorescence through N&#8208;protonation in nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes. The first mechanism regulates the transition to a &#960;&#960;* TICT state, while the second applies when a nonradiative decay pathway dominates, involving a dark n&#960;* state that is also accompanied by structural twisting and can be considered a type of TICT state.







Abstract
N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, the excited state deactivation processes are systematically investigated for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. Two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation are concluded: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. The current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase&#8208;like Activity of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Nanoparticles Comprising Biomimetic Imidazolato&#8208;bridged CuZn Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks possess superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticle closely mimics the active site of CuZn&#8208;SOD and exhibits exceptional SOD&#8208;like activity and recyclability due to its numerous copper active sites. These porous nanoparticles hold promise for future applications.







Abstract
Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control: How can allosteric sites be more effectively targeted by small&#8208;molecule drugs? Using an integrated in&#8197;vitro/in silico experimental workflow; we discovered novel allosteric inhibitors of caspase&#8208;7 and revealed new connections between the active site and the remote allosteric site (i.&#8201;e., allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships, ASARs) for this valuable disease target.







Abstract
Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.&#8201;g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small&#8208;molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle by using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation by neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs).

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling in Water and Organic Solvents Promoted by Blends of Stabilized Convoluted Polymeric Palladium Catalysts and Polymeric Auxiliary Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and stable catalytic system, which was developed by blending a functional copolymer self&#8208;assembled palladium catalyst with polymeric auxiliary material, allows the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of various biphenyls in organic solvents or water as the sole solvent.







Abstract
Given that heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation reactions under continuous&#8208;flow conditions are well suited for the efficient and safe production of pharmaceuticals and functional materials, the development of active and durable catalysts for this purpose is a matter of high practical significance. Here, a previously established molecular convolution methodology was used to synthesize catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under flow conditions by blending convoluted polymeric palladium catalysts (prepared from copolymers of 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene) and crosslinked polymeric auxiliary materials (prepared from copolymers of divinylbenzene and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene). The optimal catalyst exhibited high performance and durability and allowed numerous biaryl products such as liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, organic electroluminescent materials, and pharmaceuticals to be continuously synthesized with turnover frequencies of up to 238&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a demonstration of practical utility, the developed catalytic system was used for the continuous synthesis of two pharmaceuticals (felbinac and fenbufen) in water as the sole solvent.

         <title>Polymeric Unimolecular CO Dehydrogenase Mimic with both Inner and Outer Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric unimolecular nanozyme Co&#8208;1 with three&#8208;level coordination spheres as a mimic of CODH is reported herein. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction in aqueous solution was achieved with a TONCO of 1731.2, which is comparable to most of molecular catalysts in water. Mechanism study discloses that this structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic can stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate and capture CO2 to improve catalytic activity and selectivity in the similar way as CODH.







Abstract
Inspired by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), mimicking its inner and outer spheres is a promising strategy in CO2 reduction catalyst design. However, artificial CODH&#8208;like catalysts are generally limited to the inner sphere effect and only applicable in organic solvents or for electrocatalysis. Herein, an aqueous CODH mimic with both inner and outer spheres for photocatalysis is reported. In this polymeric unimolecular catalyst, the inner sphere is composed of cobalt porphyrin with four appended amido groups and the outer sphere consists of four poly(2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms. Upon visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm), the as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a turnover number (TONCO) of 1731.2 in the reduction of CO2 into CO, which is comparable to most reported molecular catalysts in aqueous solution. The mechanism studies indicate that, in this water&#8208;dispersible and structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic, the cobalt porphyrin core serves as the catalysis center and the amido groups function as hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillars helping to stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate, whereas the PDMAEMA shell renders both water solubility and a CO2 reservoir through reversibly capturing of CO2. The present work has clarified the significance of coordination sphere effects for improving the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CODH mimics.

The first mixed&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly reactions of the organometallic diantimony complex [(Cp)2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)] (C) with Ag[TEF] ([TEF]=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]) in the presence of various N&#8208;donor molecules are presented. Depending on the organic linker, these reactions lead to the formation of two 0D, three 1D or one 2D novel hybrid organometallic&#8211;organic supramolecular aggregates. One of the polymeric assemblies represents a unique compound incorporating both Sb&#8208; and N&#8208;donor ligands as connectors for metal ions.







Abstract
The reactions of the organometallic ligand complex [Cp2Mo2(CO)4(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;Sb2)] (C) with Ag[TEF] ([TEF]&#8722;=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;) in the presence of a number of di&#8208; or polytopic N&#8208;donor molecules (1,6,7,12&#8208;tetraazaperylene (L1), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (L2), 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (L3), trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (L4) and 1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (L5)), were studied. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry and choice of linker, these reactions lead to the selective formation of dimeric or tetrameric supramolecular coordination complexes as well as 1D and 2D coordination polymers (CPs). The presented compounds are unique examples of supramolecular complexes incorporating both organometallic Sb&#8208;donor and organic N&#8208;donor molecules as ligands to stabilize metal ions. Moreover, one of the formed compounds, the CP [Ag4(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;C)4(L4)4]n[TEF]4n, represents an exceptional 1D polymer incorporating both N&#8208; and Sb&#8208;donor ligands as connectors for metal ions.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels by Forming Robust Hydrazide&#8208;Transition Metal Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels were developed by forming robust hydrazide&#8208;Zn2+ coordination complexes. The mechanical properties of the resultant gels exhibited a notable temperature dependence and thus a good shape&#8208;memory ability due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. The reactive amine group of the hydrazide enables facile surface modification and functionalization based on Schiff's base reactions.







Abstract
Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is an effective way to toughen hydrogels for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal&#8208;ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Here a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions is reported. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. In addition, the amine group of hydrazides in the gel matrix provides a reactive site for Schiff's base reaction, enabling surface modification without influence on overall mechanical performances of the gel. The hydrazide ligands are easy to synthesize and can coordinate very well with several transition metals. Such a metal&#8208;ligand coordination should be suitable to develop tough soft materials with versatile applications.

         <title>&#963;,&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bis(germylene) Adducts with NHC and CAACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both N&#8208;heterocyclic and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (NHC and CAACs) form the carbene coordinated &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugated adducts from one and the same bis(germylene). Their structures and properties are fundamentally different: while the strong Ge=C double bonds in the bis(germene) outperform the dative bonds in the NHC adduct, the latter serves as precursor for polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the reaction with triphenylborane.







Abstract
Heavier tetrylenes attract attention for their potential in synthesis, catalysis and small molecule activation. The coordination by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) results in substantial structural and electronic differences although typically only one of these yields stable derivatives for one and the same tetrylene. We now report both NHC&#8208; and CAAC&#8208;coordination to a bridged bis(germylene) motif. The NHC&#8208;coordinated bis(germylene) exhibits pyramidal germanium centers with lone pairs of electrons, while with CAAC an unprecedented stable bis(germene) with two Ge=C bonds is isolated. Spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence as well as DFT calculations confirm the effects of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation between the two germanium centers in both cases. The coordination of NHC is reversible as the reaction with BPh3 liberates the transient bis(germylene) and thus provides an alternative low&#8208;temperature route towards polymers with Ge=Ge bonds.

A universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular hybrid co&#8208;assemblies is proposed (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional layered aminoclay (AC) and various nonconjugated amino acid via simple and environmentally friendly magnetic stirring strategy, which exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water and multilevel information encryption application.







Abstract

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical and DFT investigations of the redox behaviours of a series of hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substitution at the bridge&#8208;head atom show that, in the same experimental conditions, the dithiolate bulk exerts a control in the ordering of reduction potentials (inverted vs. normal) and in the timing of the structural changes coupled to the electron transfers.







Abstract
Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X=CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn=CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2&#8197;M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depends on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8722;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et&#8594;Bn replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.

         <title>Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reaction Enabled by Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic amounts of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 promoted the aldol condensation in a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reaction. The investigation of the system showed that the cobalt catalyst and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the aldol condensation in a cooperative fashion. Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 activates the aldehyde product by adsorption, as shown by DFT.







Abstract
The tandem hydroformylation&#8208;aldol condensation (tandem HF&#8208;AC) reaction offers an efficient synthetic route to the synthesis of industrially relevant products. The addition of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 to the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of 1&#8208;hexene enables tandem HF&#8208;AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17&#8197;times compared to that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5&#8197;times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co2(CO)8 and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation.

         <title>The Origin of Catalysis and Regioselectivity of Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with Tropone
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how the regioselectivity between [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions of tropone can be steered by the use of Lewis acids, which catalyze the reactions via a LUMO&#8208;lowering effect.







Abstract
We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12&#8197;kcal mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator undergoes disulphide bond formation and forms a self&#8208;supporting, thixotropic, insoluble hydrogel via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. The resultant hydrogelator was exploited to remove toxic organic dyes from contaminated water in the gel phase and solid supports, indicating its potential applicability for water remediation.







Abstract
A single amino acid in a peptide sequence can play an important role to tune the self&#8208;assembly and hydrogelation behaviour. Here, a C&#8208;terminal cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator forms hydrogel through non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions. Interestingly, the hydrogel is insoluble in water and buffer solutions at different pH values (1&#8208;13) and is thixotropic and injectable. In recent years, removing dyes from contaminated water has become a significant concern because of the shortage of freshwater resources. Therefore, the adsorption of dyes through a reliable, straightforward, nontoxic, cheap, and environmentally friendly adsorbent has become a popular topic. Hence, the hydrogelator was exploited to remove organic dyes from wastewater, harnessing its applicability in the gel phase and solid supports (filter paper and cotton).

         <title>A Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Well&#8208;Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, transformative methodology for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.e. 4800 cm&#8722;1, brightness ca. 80,000 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150 GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and novel merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkynes for the Synthesis of Derivatized Dihydropyrrolones: Regioselectivity Under Thermodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl&#8208;based complexes present opportunities for underexplored disconnections in synthesis. Access to challenging dihydropyrrolone products is achieved by propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of alkynes for the formation of cyclic organoiron species. Excellent regioselectivity for unsymmetrical alkynes is observed in many cases. Notably, regioselectivity under these stoichiometric conditions diverges from those observed previously under catalysis, occurring at the more&#8208;substituted terminus of the alkyne, and allowing for methine functionalization and the formation of quaternary centers. Divergent demetallation of the intermediate organoiron complexes gives access to chemically diverse products which are further amenable to functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimides/Polyvinyl Alcohol Coassembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we proposed a delicate strategy based on a coassembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and varies to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is tactfully achieved via an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel coassembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte in Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;S and Li&#8208;O2 batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solid polymer electrolyte is developed and employed in lithium&#8208;metal batteries of relevant interest. The material employes crystalline polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME), LiTFSI and LiNO3 salts, and SiO2 ceramic filler. The electrolyte shows ionic conductivity over than 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature and approaching 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C, Li+ transference number exceeding 0.3, electrochemical stability from 0 to 4.4 V vs. Li+/Li, lithium stripping/deposition overvoltage below 0.08 V, and electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance of 400 &#937;. Thermogravimetry indicates that the electrolyte stands up to 200 &#176;C without significant weight loss, while FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy suggests the dissolution of the LiTFSI conducting salt in the polymer. The electrolyte is used in solid state cells with various cathodes, including olivine LiFePO4 exploiting the Li&#8208;insertion, sulfur&#8208;carbon composite operating through Li&#8208;conversion, and an oxygen electrode in which reduction and evolution reactions (i.e., ORR/OER) evolve on carbon&#8208;coated gas diffusion layer (GDL). The cells reversibly operate at the room temperature with a capacity of 140 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3.4 V for LiFePO4, 400 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 V for sulfur electrode, and 500 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2.5 V for oxygen. The results suggest the electrolyte for application in room&#8208;temperature solid polymer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning the Imidazole Core into Three&#8208;Dimensional Ring Systems: Mild Organocatalytic Entry to Enantiopure 6,7&#8208;Dihydrobenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzofused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivities. Post&#8208;cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole&#8208;based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;alkylated pyridoxal derivatives as negative electrolyte materials for aqueous organic flow batteries: Computational screening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.</dc:description>

         <title>From Framework to Layers Driven by Pressure &#8211; The Monophyllo&#8208;Oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and Comparison to its &#945;&#8208;Polymorph</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications. The novel monophyllo&#8208;oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 was obtained by using the high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique.

         <dc:description>Chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules have drawn attention for their helical self&#8208;assembly and special optical properties. The helical self&#8208;assembly of AIE&#8208;active chiral non&#8208;linear main&#8208;chain polymers would produced some desired optical features. In this work, a series of V&#8208;shaped chiral AIE&#8208;active polyamides P1&#8208;C3, P1&#8208;C6, P1&#8208;C12 and linear P2&#8208;C3, P2&#8208;C6, bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains, based on tetraphenyl&#8208;butadiene (TPB) were prepared. All of the target main&#8208;chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer P1&#8208;C6 with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V&#8208;shaped main&#8208;chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine in each repeating&#160;unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformations, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano&#8208;fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self&#8208;assemble in THF/H2O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano&#8208;fibers cause P1&#8208;C6 produce strong CD signals with positive Cotton effect. Moreover, P1&#8208;C6 could also occur fluorescence quenching response to Fe3+ selectively with a low detection limit of 3.48 &#956;mol/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells and their interaction with the [10]cycloparaphenylene nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules bridged by isosorbide \ isomannide moieties. Their electrochemical behaviour and complexation with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were also investigated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of fullerene dumbbells showed high electron affinity, highlighting their ability to interact well with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which are charge and shape complementary. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and additional information about binding stoichiometries was obtained by NMR titration experiments. Two different approaches were used, resulting in bridged cyclopropane&#8208; and furan&#8208;based structures. Regardless of the type of linker, all derivatives formed conventional 2:1 complexes [10]CPP2&#8835;C60 derivative. However, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules showed different binding behaviour as mono&#8208;, bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected. The formation of linear polymers could be of great importance for solar energy conversion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding in Conformationally Dynamic Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) [2]rotaxanes were prepared via a combination of passive and active metal template&#8208;directed strategies. The ability of the [2]rotaxanes to bind alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs was investigated by extensive 1H NMR titration studies, wherein detailed analysis of cation, anion and ion&#8208;pair affinity measurements indicate dramatic positive cooperative enhancements in halide anion association upon either Na+ or K+ pre&#8208;complexation. We demonstrate that careful consideration of multiple, parallel and competing binding equilibria is essential when interpreting observed 1H NMR spectral changes in ion&#8208;pair receptor systems, especially those which exhibit dynamic behaviour. Importantly, in comparison to XB [2]catenane analogues, these neutral XB heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems demonstrated that despite their relatively weaker cation and anion binding abilities, they exhibit a notably higher level of positive cooperativity for alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pair binding, highlighting the role of greater co&#8208;conformational adaptive behaviour in mechanically&#8208;bonded hosts for the purposes of charged species recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Reexamine the emergence and stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in $\mathrm{B_1 A_1 B_2 A_2 B_3}$ linear pentablock and $\mathrm{(B_1AB_2)_5}$ star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as
the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the $\mathrm{B_1 A_1 B_2 A_2 B_3}$ copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the $\mathrm{(B_1AB_2)_5}$ copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In order to observe long&#8208;lived charge separated (CS) states in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, herein we prepared a series of anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) dyads, with adamantane as the linker. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra show negligible electronic interaction between the AQ and PTZ units at ground state, yet charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed. Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the 3AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for AQ&#8208;PTZ in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN), a 3CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M. The 3CS state lifetime of were determined as 0.52 &#956;s and 0.49 &#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the 3AQ state was observed in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. For AQ&#8208;PTZ, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the 3AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of 3CS state takes 106 ps in ACN. For AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, a 3CS state is formed in CHX within 241 ps. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2J| &#8805; 5.68 mT was observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ and AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, whereas in the dyads with PTZ unit oxidized, only the 3AQ state was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization, Decyclization, and Metallacyclization of Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Homopropargylic Alcohols on Ruthenium(II) and Osmium(II) Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M = Ru/Os; dppm = 1,1bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR), which uses solar energy to convert CO2 and H2O into chemical feedstocks or fuels without sacrificial reagents, plays a momentous role in CO2 utilization and solar energy conversion. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self&#8208;driving material development, Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier&#8208;material matching. Finally, we discuss essential future research directions in the field. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to provide strategic guidance for the development of efficient overall PCRR systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic Si&#8208;H Activation by Acetonitrilo Benzo[h]quinoline Iridacycles: Influence of Electronic Effects in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of six newly synthesized benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8208;X (&#8208;OMe, &#8208;H, &#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;NO2 and &#8211;(NO2)2) on the heterochelating ligand were evaluated in the dehydro&#8208;O&#8208;silylation of benzyl alcohol and the monohydrosilylation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzonitrile by Et3SiH, two reactions involving the electrophilic activation of the Si&#8208;H bond. The benchmark shows a direct dependence of the catalytic efficiency with the electronic effect of &#8208;X, which is confirmed by theoretical assessment of the intrinsic silylicities &#928; of hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts and by the theoretical evaluation of the propensity of hydridospecies to transfer the hydrido ligand to the activated substrate. The revisited analysis of the Ir&#8208;Si&#8208;H interactions shows that the most cohesive bond in hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts is the Ir&#8208;H one, while the Ir&#8208;Si is a weak donor&#8208;acceptor dative bond. The Si&#8230;H interaction in all the cases is noncovalent in nature and dominated by electrostatics confirming the heterolytic cleavage of the hydrosilane&#8217;s Si&#8208;H bond in this key catalytically relevant species.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Cs2SnBr6/rGO Composite for Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance for the selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived HMF, obtaining&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% selectivity of DFF with the synergistic effect of &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2. This study shows that Cs2SnBr6&#8208;based perovskite provides more possibilities and options in employing highly efficient and environment&#8208;stable lead&#8208;free perovskites.







Abstract
Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology&#8208;friendly, air&#8208;stable and highly active metal&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a new and stable lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs2SnBr6 decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as&#8208;prepared Cs2SnBr6 is ultrastable, exhibiting no clear changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo&#8208;driven&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving&gt;99.5&#8201;% conversion of HMF and 88&#8201;% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O2. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo&#8208;driven conversion of HMF to DFF. This work expands the material gallery towards selective organic conversion and environmentally friendly perovskite options for photocatalytic application.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Amphoteric &#945;&#8208;Haloalkenyl Boronates by Halogenative Semipinacol Rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen&#8208;induced halogenative semipinacol rearrangement of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols is reported herein. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions to access a variety of synthetically valuable carbonyl&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates with moderate to good yields and excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of stereo&#8208;defined and transformable functionality&#8208;enriched building blocks is of great importance in modern organic chemistry, as it allows the rapid and divergent assembly of complex molecules. Herein a halogen electrophile (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) initiated semipinacol rearrangement reaction of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols (MIDA=N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl) by aryl migration towards the synthesis of amphoteric &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates in moderate to good yields with excellent stereoselectivities is reported. The value of the products is evidenced by their ability to undergo divergent conversions to polysubstituted alkenes through manipulation of the C&#8722;B and C&#8722;X (X=Br, I) bonds and the carbonyl group.

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the right amount of an easily available chromium(III) complex bearing a bulky acetylacetonato ligand to keep it chemically inert, NMR spectra acquired in continuous flow give much better data due to significantly reduced polarisation and relaxation times without undue peak broadening or loss of 2D methods.







Abstract
Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence times of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical for low sensititvity nuclei at low concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] are investigated for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III) acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds, successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at PRA concentrations as low as 10&#8197;mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions. Compatibility with a range of representative transition metal complexes often used in homogeneous catalysis has been investigated, and application of [Cr(tmhd)3] in significantly improving 1H and 31P{1H} FlowNMR data quality in a Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylation reaction has been demonstrated. With the PRA added, 13C relaxation times were reduced more than six&#8208;fold, allowing quantitative reaction monitoring of substrate consumption and product formation by 13C{1H} FlowNMR spectroscopy at natural abundance.

         <title>Design of Cu&#8208;substituted O3&#8208;type NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode materials with abundant reserves have a promising prospect in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical reversibility of most O3&#8208;type Fe/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathode materials is still not high enough. Herein, the effect of different Cu contents on the electrochemical properties of O3&#8208;NaFe0.50Mn0.50O2 materials is systematically investigated. The as&#8208;prepared NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode achieves the synergistic optimization of the interface and bulk phase, and showes superior electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 114 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, a capacity retention rate of 94% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, and excellent chemical stability in air and water. In addition, the sodium ion full battery based on NaFe0.30Mn0.50Cu0.20O2 cathode and hard carbon anode has a capacity retention rate of 81% after 100 cycles. This research provides a useful approach for the preparation of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;type layered cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the production of hydrogen fuel from water splitting. Low&#8208;cost and efficient stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts are expected to replace the scarce platinum group metals for large&#8208;scale energy applications. Here in this work, we report the conversion of commonly available inexpensive and easily accessible 434&#8208;L stainless steel (SS) into highly active and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfuration strategies. The NixFe1&#8208;xS layer as a pre&#8208;catalyst and S&#8208;doped&#160;NixFe oxyhydroxides in situ formed on the catalyst surface are the true active species for OER.&#160;The optimized 434&#8208;L stainless steel&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 298 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in 1.0 M KOH with a small OER kinetics (the Tafel slope of 54.8 mV dec&#8208;1) and good stability.&#160;This work reveals the 434&#8208;L alloy stainless steel with Fe and Cr as the main elements can be used as qualified OER catalysts by surface modification, along with a new mentality to solve the energy and resource waste problems.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Element&#8208;dependent photophysical properties were observed from dialdiminate complexes containing Group&#8197;13 elements. Alteration of the central elements results in a shift in the absorption wavelength, an enhancement of the responsiveness toward Lewis bases, and the appearance of the ligand exchange reactions. In this paper, the mechanisms are explored.







Abstract
Novel luminescent dialdiminate complexes of the Group&#8197;13 elements were prepared to evaluate the effects of the central element on their properties. We demonstrate that their absorption wavelength and the response to Lewis bases apparently depend on the central atom. The aluminum complex exhibited the absorption band in the higher&#8208;energy region than the gallium and indium congeners. Theoretical calculations suggest that the aluminum complex has a lower&#8208;lying highest&#8208;occupied molecular orbital than the other complexes. Additionally, the emission intensity of the aluminum complex clearly changed in response to a Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that these element&#8208;dependent optical properties could originate from the difference in the electric charges on the central elements. Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl3 and InMe3. Furthermore, all the complexes showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.

Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and InMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, all the complexes showed aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization-induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Electronic Effect of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyst on an Asymmetric Benzoin Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of remote electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst increased enantioselectivity of the benzoin reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. The increased enantioselectivity was rationalized by DFT calculations with noncovalent&#8208;interaction and distortion/interaction&#8208;energy analyses.







Abstract
A remote electronic effect of chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst on an asymmetric benzoin reaction was investigated. The catalyst bearing remote electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents increased enantioselectivity of the reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. DFT calculations rationalized the increased enantioselectivity.

         <title>Helical Anatase Titanium Nanotubes through a Protected Crystallization Strategy for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helical anatase titanium nanotube was prepared through a protected crystallization strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Helical anatase titanium nanotube possesses abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure and exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Helical structure in catalysts has attracted attention and been recently investigated for various catalytic reactions. However, helical transition metal oxides suffer from uncontrollable crystallization processes at high temperatures when being transformed from an amorphous phase into a crystalline structure. Herein, we report a helical anatase TiO2 nanotube for the first time, which has been prepared using a protected crystallization strategy in the confined space of silica. A single chirality of helical TiO2 has been used to track the ordering of the twisted structure. The twisted structure in helical anatase TiO2 nanotube is maintained after a vigorous crystallization process. Helical anatase TiO2 nanotubes possess more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure. The obtained helical anatase TiO2 nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Stimuli Responsive Features of Organic RTP Materials: An Intriguing Carbazole&#8208;Cyclic Triimidazole Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triimidazole&#8208;carbazole derivative TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz here synthesized possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. The origin of the compound stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is interpreted through X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;TDDFT studies. Interconversion between TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz solvated and unsolvated phases occurs through solvent fuming and/or thermal treatment. Phosphorescent aqueous nanoaggregates are prepared from solvent/non&#8208;solvent solutions.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive luminescent materials possessing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are extremely desirable for various applications. The here investigated derivative of cyclic triimidazole (TT) functionalized with carbazole (Cz), namely TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz, belongs to this class. TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. It has been isolated as MeOH&#8208;solvated and de&#8208;solvated forms characterized by distinctive emissive features. In particular, the solvated form, in which hydrogen bonds with MeOH inhibit competitive non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels, possesses a higher quantum yield associated with a strong phosphorescence contribution which is preserved in DMSO/water solutions.

         <title>A Blue Light and Two&#8208;Photon Activatable Rhodamine Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation and regulation of biological structures and functions with light require precise characterization of the used illumination and imaging systems. Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) deliver fluorescent signals upon light irradiation, therefore enabling spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Our immobilized photoactivatable rhodamine derivative can be activated by both blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P), providing stable high&#8208;contrast images by laser scanning microscopy.







Abstract
Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) are powerful tools for biological imaging applications because they provide spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation.

         <title>Structural Perspective into the Interaction of an Oncogenesis&#8208;Relevant pre&#8208;miRNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligand Carrier with the Protein Nucleolin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural study of the complex between nucleolin, a protein involved in a myriad of human diseases, and the RNA G4 found in pre&#8208;miRNA 149 stabilized by the compound C8, known for its G4 stabilizing properties, was conducted. The results provide important molecular determinants at the atomic level and may pave the way for future investigations in the field.







Abstract
The structural determinants of the interaction of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) motif found in precursor miRNA 149 (rG4) with the acridine orange derivative C8, a G4 ligand stabilizer possessing anticancer activity, and the protein nucleolin (overexpressed in cancer cells) were investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For the rG4/C8 complex, the results revealed a strong stabilizing interaction between the aromatic core and the iodinated ring of the C8 ligand with the rG4 structure. The NMR study revealed also different interaction patterns between nucleolin and rG4 and nucleolin and rG4/C8 complex. In the absence of the ligand, rG4 establishes interactions with polar residues of the protein while for the rG4/C8 complex, these contacts are mainly established with amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains. However, nucleolin chemical shift perturbation studies in the presence of rG4 or rG4/C8 reveal the same location between domains 1 and 2 of the protein, which suggests that the rG4 and rG4/C8 complex bind in this region. This puzzling structural study opens a new framework to study rG4/ligand/nucleolin complexes that might impact the biogenesis of miRNA 149.

         <title>Stable Spiro&#8208;Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new type of neutral mixed&#8208;valence system was synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot procedure. The spiro&#8208;conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in&#8208;depth experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class II Robin&#8208;Day&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray data, which are relatively rare for Class II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO&#8208;HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;assisted Fabrication of O&#8208;doped CoP Microflowers with Optimal Electronic Modulation for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring efficient, affordable and stable electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great scientific significance for the practical implementation of the water splitting. The heteroatom doping represents a serviceable strategy to further elevate the catalytic performance for a transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst because of the electronic regulation effect. Herein, a reliable self&#8208;sacrificial template&#8208;engaged approach is proposed to synthesize O&#8208;doped CoP (denoted as O&#8208;CoP) microflowers, which simultaneously considers the regualtion of electronic configuration via anion doping and sufficient exposure of active sites via nanostructure engineering. The suitable O incorporation content in CoP matrix could tremendously modify the electronic configuration, accelerate the charge transfer, promote the exposure of active sites, strengthen the electrical conductivity, and adjust the adsorption state of H*. Consequently, the optimized O&#8208;CoP microflowers with optimal O concentration display a remarkable HER property with a small overpotential of 125 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec&#8208;1 and long&#8208;term durability for 32 h under alkaline electrolyte. The integration of anion incorporation and architecture engineering in this work will bring in a depth insight for the design of low&#8208;cost and effective electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acidic bismuth compounds have found catalytic applications in the reduction of unsaturated bonds. In this work, we present the inferences from the mechanistic studies on the catalytic reduction of ketones and phosphine oxides using the organobismuth dication [NMe2C6H4Bi(L)3][Al{OC(CF3)3}4] in the presence of silanes as reducing agents. Experiments and computations converge to a Si&#8208;H activation pathway in the reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.</dc:description>

         <title>Inversion of diaza[5]helicenes through an N&#8208;N bond breaking pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine and its S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide are diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8208;N linkages. Kinetic experiments on racemization together with DFT calculations revealed that they undergo inversion through the N&#8208;N bond breaking pathway rather than the general conformational pathway. In these diaza[5]helicenes with this inversion mechanism, the reduction of electronic repulsion in the N&#8208;N bond by modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix led to a significantly higher inversion barrier, 35.3 kcal/mol, compared to [5]helicene. 1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide was highly resistant to acid&#8208;mediated N&#8208;N bond breaking and racemization under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically mediated toluene oxidation through a copper complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method is described to photochemically oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. As a result, a "dioxygen adduct" copper complex, e. g. a peroxido complex, is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously. The ligand tris(2&#8208;methyl pyridyl)amine (tmpa) led to the highest conversion rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Five Tryptophan Isomers and Application of the Isomers to Solid&#8208;Phase Total Syntheses of Lysocin E Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tryptophan (Trp) plays a unique role in peptides and proteins as its indole ring possesses an electron&#8208;rich character and an N1&#8211;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor. Because of its non&#8208;rotationally symmetric structure, synthetic alterations of the orientation of the indole ring would modulate the intrinsic structures and functions of peptides and proteins. Here we developed synthetic routes to the five Trp isomers in which the C3&#8208;substitution of the indole ring was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions, and applied the five monomers to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Specifically, the five monomers were prepared via Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions of C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;iodoindoles. To demonstrate the applicability of the monomers to the solid&#8208;phase synthesis, the five Trp isomers of macrocyclic antibiotic lysocin E were selected as target molecules and synthesized through peptide elongation, on&#8208;resin macrocyclization, and global deprotection. The Trp isomers displayed markedly weaker antibacterial activity than the parent natural product, revealing the biological importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue of lysocin E. The present methods for the preparation and application of these five Trp isomers provide a new strategy for analyzing and modifying the specific functions of numerous Trp&#8208;containing peptides and proteins beyond this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Minisci Reaction with Diazines: An Approach Toward Original Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a photoinduced Minisci reaction on a large panel of diazines with good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44% to 89%). The reaction using 4CzIPN (1 mol%) as photoinitiator was carried out under white LED irradiation and required a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2 equiv.). Cyclization reactions were then developed to access original N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks for drug discovery programs. An extension of the reaction to continuous flow was also reported. Finally, the mechanism of the transformation was studied suggesting a plausible radical chain mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation, Structural and Physical Characterization as well as Reactivity of Persistent Acenium Radical Cation Salts.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unsubstituted acenium radical cations (ARCs) are extremely sensitive and were hitherto only studied in situ, i.e. in the gas phase, as dilute solutions in strong acids or by matrix isolation spectroscopy at about 10 K. In this study, we prepared, structurally, electro&#173;chemical&#173;ly and spectroscopically characterized room temperature stable ARC salts with the weakly coordi&#173;nating anion [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF = &#8208;OC(CF3)3) supported by the weakly coordi&#173;nating sol&#173;vent 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (TFB). Reaction of the neutral acenes with Ag+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led, non&#8208;innocent, to intermediate [Ag2(acene)2]2+ complexes, which decompose over time to Ag0 and the corresponding (impure) ARC salts. By contrast, direct deelectronation with the recently developed innocent deelectronator radical cation salt [anthraceneHal]+&#8729;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; led to phase&#8208;pure products [acene]+&#8729;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (anthraceneHal = 9,10&#8208;dichlorooctafluoro&#173;anthracene; acene = anthra&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, pentacene). For the first time, a homogenous set of spectroscopic data on analytically pure ARC salts was obtained. In addition, cyclo&#173;voltammetric measure&#173;ments of the acenes connected the potentials in solution with those in the gas&#8208;phase. Hence, the data complement the existing isolated gas&#8208;phase, strong acid or matrix isolation studies. A first entry to follow&#8208;up chemistry of the acenium radical cations as ligand forming oxidizers was demonstrated by reaction with &#189; Co2(CO)8 giving [Co(anthracene)(CO)2]+.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong chiroptical effects in the absorption and emission of macrocycles based on the 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate minimal fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral fluorescent macrocycles consisting of two to four units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate can be readily synthesized in a one&#8208;pot manner from inexpensive building blocks. Depending on the concentration, either a paracyclophane&#8208;like dimer with closely stacked benzene rings or a triangular trimer is the main product of the reaction. The macrocycles exhibit fluorescence in solution as well as in the solid state with maxima that are red&#8208;shifted with decreasing size of the macrocyclic ring and are observed at wavelengths from 590 nm (tetramer in solution) up to 700 nm (dimer in the solid state). Chirality dictates the differential absorption and emission of circularly polarized light of these molecules. The ECD and CPL effects are particularly strong for the trimer, which is characterized by relatively large dissymmetry factors gabs &#177;2.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 531 nm and glum &#177;2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 580 nm in n&#8208;hexane, being at the same time highly luminescent (&#934;fl = 13.7%). Despite the small chromophore, the circularly polarized brightness BCPL of 2.3 dm3mol&#8722;1cm&#8208;1 is comparable with values reported for other classes of established CPL emitters in the visible region, such as expanded helicenes or larger &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthradithiophene (ADT)&#8208;Based Polymerized Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cell (APSC) acceptors typically involves increased building block synthetic complexity, hence potentially unscalable syntheses and/or prohibitive costs. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and implementation in APSCs of three new polymer acceptors P1&#8208;P3 using a scalable donor fragment, bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)anthra[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,10&#8208;dicarboxylate (ADT) co&#8208;polymerized with the high&#8208;efficiency acceptor units, NDI, Y6, and IDIC. All three copolymers have comparable photophysics to known polymers, however APSCs fabricated by blending P1, P2 and P3 with donor polymers PM5 and PM6 exhibit modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion P2&#8208;based APSC achieving PCE = 5.64%. Detailed morphological and microstructural analysis by AFM and GIWAXS reveal a non&#8208;optimal APSC active layer morphology which suppresses charge transport. Despite the modest efficiencies, these APSCs demonstrate the feasibility of using ADT as a scalable and inexpensive electron rich/donor building block for APSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Arylation of Dithiophene&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene: Tuneable Electronic Properties and 2D Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Networks at the Solid/Liquid Interface
</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein we report the direct C&#8722;H arylation of dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with different groups. The self&#8208;assembly of DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy, which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene is among the best known building blocks in molecular electronics due to its outstanding electron&#8208;donating and redox properties. Among its derivatives, dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) has attracted considerable interest in organic electronics, owing to its high field&#8208;effect mobility. Herein, we report the direct C&#8722;H arylation of DT&#8208;TTF to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups in order to evaluate their influence on the electronic properties by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Self&#8208;assembly of the DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H&#8208;bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT&#8208;TTF derivatives towards the design and construction of novel &#960;&#8208;extended electroactive frameworks.

         <title>Beyond the Limits of Atropochirality: Design of Highly Conformationally Restrained Biaryls with Bridgehead Phosphine Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last three decades, reacting sterically congested ortho&#8208;substituted arenes to form atropochiral biaryls is an appealing venture and a challenging subject that has garnered significant attention. Therefore, there is interest in developing methods to prepare these compounds. In this study, we presebt an efficient approach to produce a new class 2,2&#8217; disubstituted biaryls bridgehead phosphine oxides with an unusual topology and exceptional conformational stability. Our methodology demonstrates that, depending on the substitution pattern on the aryl moieties, the methanophosphocine backbone could be rigid enough to observe a double atropochirality, resulting in an under covered class of molecules. Notably, our studies revealed that replacing only one hydrogen at the ortho position by a fluorine atom led to sufficiently restricted rotation at temperatures below 80 &#176;C, extending &#8220;far away&#8221; the limits of atropostability. Finally, our investigations which employed variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, yielded unique insights into the isomerisation mechanism, indicating that the two biaryl motifs are fully independent in spite of their proximity.</dc:description>

         <title>Combinatorial Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly for Organopalladium Cages with Fine&#8208;Tuned Structure and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to create the lower&#8208;symmetric coordination cages with increasing structural complexities and advanced functions. In this concept article, we define and summarized the strategy for the combinatorial self&#8208;assembled PdII coordination cages. Emergent functions on some selected PdII coordination cages were also introduced with an aim of emphasizing the advantages of the heteroleptic cages.







Abstract
Discrete organopalladium coordination cages have shown great potential in applications ranging from molecular recognition and sensing, drug delivery to enzymatic catalysis. While many of the known organopalladium cages are homoleptic structures with regular polyhedral shapes and symmetric inner cavities, heteroleptic cages with complex architectures and new functions coming from their anisotropic cavities have received an increasing attention recently. In this concept article, we discuss a powerful combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy toward the construction of a family of organopalladium cages, including both homoleptic and heteroleptic ones, from a given library of ligands. Within such a cage family, the heteroleptic cages often feature systematically fine&#8208;tuned structures and emergent properties, distinct from their parent homoleptic counterparts. We hope the concepts and examples provided in this article can offer some rational guidance for the design of new coordination cages toward advanced functions.

         <title>Rationalizing the Extent of the &#8220;Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers&#8221; Effect in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: Effect of Copper Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>

Lower optical purities of supramolecular helical catalysts embedding a low fraction of &#8220;sergeants&#8221; is due to the aggregation of single helices through copper crosslinks.[MR1]&#160;







Abstract
Aggregation of supramolecular helices, for example through interdigitation of their alkyl side chains or through more directional supramolecular interactions, leads to hierarchical architectures with original structural and chiroptical properties. However, when a chiral monomer (the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;) is introduced as a minor component in these assemblies composed of a majority of achiral monomers (the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;), it is not clear how the aggregation changes the ability of the sergeant to induce a preferential helicity to the polymer main chain (the so&#8208;called &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect). This study reports a detailed investigation of the influence of [Cu(OAc)2&#8901;H2O] coordination on the structure and chiroptical properties of helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;assemblies composed of a catalytically&#8208;active benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, acting as the &#8220;soldier&#8221;, and an enantiopure BTA monomer derived from cyclohexylalanine, playing the role of the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;. The copper actually significantly influences the extent of the &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect since it acts as a crosslink that induces some chiral defects in the supramolecular helices. These crosslinks appear to be preserved during the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4&#8208;nitroacetophenone. The aggregation of helices through the formation of copper crosslinks is reversible since homochiral single helices are exclusively formed in the case of sergeant&#8208;rich assemblies. The fact that both main chain and side chain aggregation affects the chiroptical properties of supramolecular helices must be considered in the design of elaborated chiral materials.

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyst C70 was introduced for the facile construction of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines under mild conditions, yielding a diverse library of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Low catalyst loading, gram scale synthesis, and broad substrate scope (48 examples) demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol and encourage its future application as a photoredox catalyst in organic transformations.







Abstract
Herein, fullerene (C70) is introduced as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#934;&#9653;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical by energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The superoxide radical acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process. Azomethine ylide further participates in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Activatable Prodrug and Metal Prodrug Conjugate of Gossypol: Synthesis, Emergent Photophysical, Nanoscopic, Computational, and in&#8208;Vitro Cellular Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reversible metal coordination behavior of metallothionine, we hypothesized that a similar strategy could be used to protect and stabilize the reactive functionality of the drug gossypol for its stimuli&#8208;responsive release. The reactive functionalities can be masked in two&#8208;stages by introducing pH&#8208;activatable imine bonds followed by metal ion coordination stabilizing and forming confined molecular structures to release the active drug at the site of action.







Abstract
The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability of their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome challenges. In this study, tumor&#8208;environment&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;activatable prodrug and metal&#8208;prodrug conjugate has been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre&#8208;clinically tested natural compound, gossypol, was modified to form a pH&#8208;responsive prodrug by incorporating an imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio&#8208;relevant and nontoxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn&#8208;N&#8722;Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In&#8208;vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn were assessed by ESI&#8208;MS and RP&#8208;HPLC studies. The gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn demonstrated pH&#8208;specific cytotoxicity validated by the number of in&#8208;vitro cellular assays. Such a strategy can essentially be adapted to strengthen many chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and reduce side effects.

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent cages allow for the detection of the persistent organic pollutant chlordecone in water at environmental concentrations. The reported method is inexpensive, easy to carry out, and of general use for generating many measurements on contaminated water samples. This provides an affordable tool to tackle the major environmental and public health issues associated with chlordecone contamination.







Abstract
Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. This study reports on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted the choice of hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, were optimized to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed the development of a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Based on its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane, concentration, CLD concentrations were estimated over five orders of magnitude (10&#8722;2&#8211;103&#8197;&#956;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Approach for the Synthesis of Site&#8208;Specific Thioether Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation methodologies have become a central part of therapeutic development. Conjugation of thiol&#8208;containing compounds is now simple with this ionic liquid&#8208;mediated reaction which is site&#8208;specific toward thiol and preserves the stereochemistry. Additionally, Cysteine&#8208;free peptides can be functionalized using the developed technique.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.

Molecular shape and its effects: The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens is reported comparing the effect of having a lateral alkoxy chain in the central phenyl ring versus the chain being attached to the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. Rather than the molecule being required to show a tapered shape, it is the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations that is key.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to the central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited an N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of the ferroelectric nematic&#8208;nematic transition temperature, T
, exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically on the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour was found when the transition temperatures of the NF phase were compared which are higher for the NT3F.m series. This may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of the NT3F.m series compared to the NT3.m series. Therefore, it is suggested that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.

Color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials: Homonuclear EuP and TbP as well as chemically and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonates exhibit color&#8208;tunable luminescence even near white&#8208;light emission, among which TbP is further used for Fe3+ detection.







Abstract
Molecular lanthanide phosphonates [Ln2(H3tpmm)2(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Eu, EuP; Ln=Tb, TbP) were synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed that EuP has a sandwich&#8208;like dinuclear structure, in which the Eu(III) center adopts a {EuO8} distorted dodecahedral geometry. XRPD patterns prove that TbP and EuP are isomorphous and isostructural. EuP and TbP are highly thermally stable approaching 450&#8201;&#176;C and exhibit red&#8208; and green&#8208;light emissions from the characteristic 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transition of the Eu3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, luminescence modulation is achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb2&#8211;xP (x=1.5, 1, 0.5), and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate materials, p&#8208;yEuP&#8201;:&#8201;zTbP (y&#8201;:&#8201;z=3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;3), with varying the excitation wavelength. Of particular note, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is also achieved for c&#8208;EuTbP, p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;TbP, and p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;3TbP when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Therefore, these dinuclear molecular lanthanide phosphonates emitting excitation wavelength and Eu3+&#8201;:&#8201;Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence might be potential candidates for color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials. On the other hand, the bright green&#8208;light emission makes TbP to be an excellent reusable luminescence sensor for selective detection of Fe3+ with Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching constant (KSV) of 9.66&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and detection limit (DL) of 0.42&#8197;&#956;M through absorption competition caused luminescence quenching effect.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered configuration change (azobenzene) of one end of a molecular plier induces an interlocking motion at the other end (porphyrin unit) of the plier accompanied by a pivotal motion around the BINOL axis. E to Z isomerization decreases the distance between two porphyrin units which could be used for selective binding of pyridine&#8208;appended guests. Guest complexation with the plier increases the isomerization efficiency of azobenzene and decreases the thermal back isomerization rate.







Abstract
A chiral molecular plier's design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370&#8197;nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456&#8197;nm light or heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.

         <title>Factors Influencing the Chemoselectivity of Pd(OAc)2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Reactions Involving 1,6&#8208;Enynes as a Substrate and PhI(OAc)2 as a Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>

The electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.







Abstract
It is well documented in the literature that 1,6&#8208;enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6&#8208;enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa&#8208;heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06&#8208;D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations.

     alt="Factors Influencing the Chemoselectivity of Pd(OAc)2-Catalyzed Cyclization Reactions Involving 1,6-Enynes as a Substrate and PhI(OAc)2 as a Reagent"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The electronic nature&lt;/b&gt; of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;-philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well documented in the literature that 1,6-enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6-enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;-position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa-heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06-D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6-31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;-philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;-complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Dimerization into Bishelicenes: Topochemical Ullmann Coupling of Bromohelicene on Au(111)</title>

Only same handedness please! On&#8208;surface Ullmann C&#8722;C coupling of bromohelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically only to homochiral combinations into bis(helicene).







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface dimerization into bis(hexahelicene) on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry. C&#8722;C Ullmann coupling of (rac)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;hexahelicene leads to formation of the (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;diastereomers of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(hexahelicene), whilst formation of the (M,P)&#8208;diastereomer is not observed. Upon cooling, the bis(hexahelicene) aggregates into an ordered two&#8208;dimensional lattice with partly randomly distributed enantiomers. The highly specific diastereomeric coupling is explained by the surface alignment of educt in combination with the strong steric overcrowding in a possible surface&#8208;confined (M,P)&#8208;product.

         <title>Correlation of Experimental and Calculated Reaction Enthalpies with Ligand Donor Strengths</title>

         <dc:description>
Calorimetric studies on the formation of [(YPhos)AuCl] complexes confirmed the high binding strength of these ligands. The reaction enthalpies are shown to be easily obtained by calculations and correlate with the phosphine donor properties thus representing an interesting problem&#8208;specific descriptor for ligands in gold catalysis.







Abstract
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>

The incorporation of potassium citrate (PC) passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. This study reports a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79&#8201;%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6&#8201;% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850&#8197;h storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5&#8201;% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>

Be more accepting: Indenone azines, in which two indene units are cross&#8208;conjugated by an exocyclic azine (C=N&#8722;N=C) moiety, have been synthesized in a stereocontrolled manner. The azine moiety makes indenone azines planar structure and gives enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character, thus making them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks.







Abstract
Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8722;N=C), have been synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are E,E or Z,Z. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks for optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective electrophilic activation of amides and enols/ketones has been achieved using either Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride or triflic acid, which provides an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of polysubstituted indoles with flexible substituent patterns from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides or their enol&#8208;keto tautomeric mixture.







Abstract
A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supported Ru&#8208;Incorporated NiSe2 for Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) catalyst shows high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent long&#8208;term stability for large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER in alkaline medium. A great number of accessible catalytically active sites, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 contribute to its high HER activity.







Abstract
To meet the requirements for industrial water splitting to generate hydrogen, it is urgent, but still quite challenging to develop highly active and stable electrocatalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) was designed and synthesized. The introduction of Ru results in the formation of hierarchically structured Ru&#8208;NiSe2 with large electrochemical active surface area, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure. As expected, the as&#8208;fabricated Ru&#8208;NiSe2 displays impressive HER activity in 1.0&#8197;M&#8201;KOH, with a low overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ru&#8208;NiSe2 also presents outstanding long&#8208;term stability at high current densities, owing to its high intrinsic chemical stability, and strong catalyst&#8208;support interface. Notably, when performed at a certain current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotential increase after 90&#8197;h is only 13&#8197;mV. Such excellent HER performance of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 demonstrates its great potential for practical use in industrial water splitting.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons

CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell quantum dots proved to be efficient photocatalysts for a two steps [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons, whereas InP&#8208;ZnS quantum dots stopped after the first step, affording a clean allylation reaction.







Abstract
Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InP&#8208;ZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverted type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compare well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.

         <title>Copper Activation Enabling Reversible Aqueous Cu&#8722;ZnS Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries have been proposed: ZnS is gradually activated by copper to form CuS under electric field during cycling. The formed CuS undergoes a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S for energy storage. The introduction of sphalerite activation in the field of mining and metallurgy provides an idea for the design of materials design for aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries (AMSBs) have attracted research interest due to their high capacity, environmentally friendly qualities, and the accessibility of raw materials. However, the design strategies for metal&#8208;sulfide cathode have rarely been reported. Here, the copper&#8208;activated sphalerite in which Zn2+ is substituted by Cu2+ through ion exchange has been introduced for the first time as cathode for aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries. After sphalerite transformed to CuS, a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S storage mechanism has been proposed. At 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density, the capacity can reach 532.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. When cycled once at a current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity can reach 461&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the assembled Zn//ZnS hybrid ion cell delivers an energy of up to 460&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is better than for many AMSBs.

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>

Putting a green spin on [7]TH: Fluorination of the tetrathia[7]helicene backbone disclosed important functionalization&#8208;related structure&#8208;electronic alterations crucial in the design of novel chiral derivatives. [7]THs also show brilliant green phosphorescence resulting from enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) due to an S&#8208;atom effect and distortion annulation.







Abstract
Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial beacuse most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine&#8208;containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes, highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared in high yields through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550&#8197;nm, and the studies suggest an efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet nonplanar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements, while DFT calculations enable a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations to be defined.

A set of 16&#8201;chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable NHCs was synthesized in good yields with excellent enantiomeric purities (up &gt;99.75&#8201;:&#8201;0.25&#8197;er). The chiral BIAN&#8208;based Ru&#8208;complexes Ru&#8208;4&#8201;g was the most efficient to catalyse the AROCM of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;norbornenes (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Successfully converted into its corresponding Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex Z&#8208;Ru&#8208;5, the latter demonstrated high efficiency in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes in &gt;98&#8201;% Z&#8208;selectivity and the highest enantioselectivities reported so far (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).







Abstract
A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral atropBIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).

         <title>An Umpolung Approach to Acyclic 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Amides via Photoredox&#8208;Generated Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis is used to generate carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts. Addition to a range of electron&#8208;poor olefins gives the 1,4&#8208;amido&#8208;carbonyl products in good yields. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, and a transition metal or organic photocatalyst can be employed.







Abstract
A method for the generation and reaction of carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts, followed by reaction with electron&#8208;poor olefins, is described. The oxamate salt acts as a reductive quencher in the photoredox catalytic cycle, allowing mild and mass&#8208;efficient formation of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products; a challenging transformation in the context of functionalized amide formation. Increased understanding has been obtained by the use of ab initio calculations, in support of experimental observations. Furthermore, steps have been taken towards an environmentally&#8208;friendly protocol, by utilizing sodium as a cheap and low mass counterion, and demonstrating successful reactions using a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and a sustainable, non&#8208;toxic solvent system.

A high&#8208;entropy hexagonal&#8208;prismatic Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was successfully synthesized with a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. It demonstrates an excellent electrochemical stability and a superior compatibility with sodium. Solid&#8208;state batteries based on this material deliver almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) hold great promise for their merits in low&#8208;cost, high energy density, and safety. However, developing solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSBs with high performance is still a great challenge. In this study, high&#8208;entropy Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was synthesized at comparatively low sintering temperature of 950&#8201;&#176;C with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. More importantly, the Na symmetric cells using high&#8208;entropy SE show a high critical current density of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outstanding rate performance with fairly flat potential profiles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and steady cycling over 700&#8197;h under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Na3V2(PO4)3||high&#8208;entropy SE||Na batteries are further assembled manifesting a desirable cycling stability with almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles and high Columbic efficiency over 99.9&#8201;%. The findings present opportunities for the design of high&#8208;entropy Na&#8208;ion conductors toward the development of SSBs.

Preparation of spherical polymeric particles via surfactant&#8208;free RAFT emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) with reversible swelling behavior upon UV/Vis light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) assembled by monodisperse colloidal particles have attracted enormous interest recently due to their tremendous applications in smart devices. Their structural colors can be determined by particle sizes. However, the lack of a reliable way to tune the sizes in&#8197;situ limits their development. Herein, we present an efficient route to solve this problem through the fabrication of spherical polymeric particles with light&#8208;triggered reversible swelling behavior via surfactant&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Amphiphilic macro&#8208;RAFT agents containing azobenzene groups were synthesized and subsequently employed to mediate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Uniform submicron spheres were obtained by modulating solid contents and other parameters. Benefiting from the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties, the particle sizes expanded and contracted upon alternative ultraviolet/visible&#8208;light irradiation accordingly. This strategy will be a supplement to the emulsion PISA and especially give aid to the progress of the RPC materials.

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical assay for probing the cleavage of surface&#8208;confined APP peptide substrates by BACE1 was developed based on specific chemical labeling of terminal tyrosine.







Abstract
Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200&#8197;pM with a detection limit of 0.8&#8197;pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.

         <dc:description>
Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, of which sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids is proposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of H. sanguineus and its possible sponge preys is analyzed.







Abstract
A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids wasproposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4&#945;&#8208;formamidogorgon&#8208;11&#8208;ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95&#8197;&#956;M.

         <dc:description>
A novel MCI building block: picene diimide (PiDI) was successfully synthesized. The PiDI derivative PiDI&#8208;CN4 exhibited excellent OFET performance with optimal electron mobility of 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Materials Synthesis and Processing Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diimides are indispensable candidates for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors in organic optoelectronic devices. Developing new PAH diimide building blocks are of remarkable significance for material diversity and further advance in organic semiconductors. In this contribution, 4,5,8,9&#8208;picene diimide (PiDI) was designed and synthesized. Controllable stepwise bromination of PiDI were accomplished to afford 13&#8208;monobromo&#8208;, 13,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;, 2,13,14&#8208;tribromo&#8208; and 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI. Moreover, cyanation of 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI gave the corresponding tetracyanated PiDI, which can be utilized as n&#8208;type semiconductor with OFET electron mobility up 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This result demonstrates the potential of PiDI as a building block for constructing new high&#8208;performance electronic&#8208;transporting materials.

As in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, in the alcohol arylation reaction catalysed by a system combining nickel and a 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand, the presence of a Ni(0) intermediate is under debate by Density Functional Theory calculations.







Abstract
For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants. Instead, they serverd as catalytic engines. Here we present a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. Furthermore, this paper provides insight not only into the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst but also the role of the base.

By using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization of N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed.







Abstract
Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;DHPs with high efficiency. This method is performed by a one&#8208;pot cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization/C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage/cyclization strategy to form simultaneously two C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds, two C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds, and a 1,4&#8208;DHP ring.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational Screening of New Candidate Reactions with High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 28, May 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of a QM&#8208;augmented&#8208;GNN, trained on a recently generated computational dataset, a vast chemical space of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions is screened for bioorthogonal potential, i.&#8201;e., a balance between speed and selectivity. A broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity is identified as a potential starting point for future experimental development of new bioorthogonal click reactions.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05&#8201;% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within &#8764;2&#8211;3&#8197;kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.

Trees are emblems of wisdom, power and prosperity, and recall a growing force connecting different elements (earth, air, water and lives). Philosophers consider trees to be witnesses of the evolution of humans and the planet.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trees are emblems of wisdom, power and prosperity&lt;/b&gt;, and recall a growing force connecting different elements (earth, air, water and lives). Philosophers consider trees to be witnesses of the evolution of humans and the planet.

Pyrrolidines are intriguing scaffolds that can be found in a variety of natural products. They have numerous biological and organocatalytic uses. The asymmetric [3+2] cycloadditions employing metal catalysis with suitable chiral ligands is a robust method for the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidines with up to four chiral centres. Recent advances are summarized in the Review by Guiry and Kumar (DOI. 10.1002/chem.202300296).

Azomethineylide [3+2] cycloadditions are a promising strategy for the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidines. In this Review, recent developments in the enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide by metal catalysis are summarized.







Abstract
Asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition reactions are fascinating and powerful methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidines up to four stereocentres. Pyrrolidines are important compounds for both biology and organocatalytic applications. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of pyrrolidines by [3+2] cycloadditions of azomethine ylides using metal catalysis. It has been organized by the type of metal catalysis used and further arranged by the complexity nature of dipolarophile. The presentation of each reaction type highlights their advantages and limitations.

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF</title>

Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues were collected and analyzed in their morphological, mechanical, and functional features, highlighting the effects caused by the Fmoc&#8208; modification.







Abstract
Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another yields 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis.







Abstract
Herein, we describe Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another to yield 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. After bromination and nucleophilic ring opening, the second intramolecular Hiyama coupling provided various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. The optical resolution of 1,8,13&#8208;triptycene afforded an optically active form for the first time.

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known worldwide as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). An RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme was selected that does not recognize other species of bacteria but can be sensitively activated by diverse clinical strains of C.&#8197;difficile. Such a synthetic DNAzyme can easily be incorporated into various biosensor designs to diagnose CDI.







Abstract
Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and there is an urgent need for the development of more effective rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Previously we have developed an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) probe, named RFD&#8208;CD1, that is capable of detecting a specific strain of C.&#8197;difficile but is too specific to recognize other pathogenic C.&#8197;difficile strains. To overcome this issue, herein we report RFD&#8208;CD2, another RFD that is not only highly specific to C.&#8197;difficile but also capable of recognizing diverse pathogenic C.&#8197;difficile strains. Extensive sequence and structure characterization establishes a pseudoknot structure and a significantly minimized sequence for RFD&#8208;CD2. As a fluorescent sensor, RFD&#8208;CD2 can detect C.&#8197;difficile at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;CFU/mL, thus making this DNAzyme an attractive molecular probe for rapid diagnosis of CDI caused by diverse strains of C.&#8197;difficile.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aromaticity of an Alternating Cyclo[4]Thiophene[4]Furan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating furan&#8208;thiophene macrocycle has been synthesized without the need for stepwise buildup of oligomers. The ring is weakly antiaromatic due to the 4n&#8197;&#960; electrons along the outer annulene pathway of carbon atoms. The macrocycle can be made globally aromatic through chemical oxidation with SbCl5.







Abstract
A new class of conjugated macrocycle, the cyclo[4]thiophene[4]furan hexyl ester (C4TE4FE), is reported. This cycle consists of alternating &#945;&#8208;linked thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;ester and furan&#8208;3&#8208;ester repeat units, and was prepared in a single step using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)furan monomer. The ester side groups help promote a syn conformation of the heterocycles, which enables formation of the macrocycle. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that C4TE4FE could undergo multiple oxidations, so treatment with SbCl5 resulted in formation of the [C4TE4FE]2+ dication. Computational work, paired with 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of the dication, revealed that the cycle becomes globally aromatic upon 2e&#8722; oxidation, as the annulene pathway along the outer ring becomes H&#252;ckel aromatic. The change in ring current for the cycle upon oxidation was clear from 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, as the protons of the thiophene and furan rings shifted downfield by nearly 6&#8197;ppm. This work highlights the potential of sequence control in furan&#8208;based macrocycles to tune electronic properties.

         <title>A N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Zinc Catalyst for the 1,2&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;Zn complex with a fluorenyl sidearm catalyses the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes in highly 1,2&#8208;regioselective manner in addition to other routine substrates like carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile. A detailed computational analysis justifies the regioselectivity and also addresses the relative rate difference between different p&#8208;substituted pyridines. The computed pathway involves a molecular zinc hydride that is experimentally isolated and derivatized.







Abstract
A fluorenyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene LH (LH=[(Flu)H&#8722;(CH2)2&#8722;NHCDipp]) and its monoanionic version L&#8722; are explored in complexation with zinc towards the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes, carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile under ambient condition. The N&#8208;heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p&#8208;substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L&#8722; for steric reasons despite both giving three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn&#8722;H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin molecule possessing two cleft cavities showed negative homotropic cooperativity in the host&#8211;guest complex. When an electron&#8208;deficient guest molecule (yellow) was accommodated within one of the cleft cavities, the electronic structure of the porphyrin was altered, and the binding power of the remaining cavity was reduced. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300107).

         <title>Effect of Flexible Spacer and Alkyl Tail Length on the Liquid Crystalline Phase Behavior of Fullerene Block Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated here the supramolecular liquid crystalline (LC) phase behavior of a series of fullerene block molecules with regard to spacer length, alkyl tail length and temperature. These compounds exhibit several lamellar LC phases with different packings of the self&#8208;organized fullerene two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals. With a short hexamethylene spacer, they form sandwich&#8208;like structures with triple or quadruple fullerene layers. By increasing spacer length to 10 or 12 carbons long, a composite layers&#8208;in&#8208;lamella superlattice structure with alternating soft hydrocarbon single layers and fullerene single or double layers was obtained. As the molecular configurational freedom between incompatible moieties is enhanced by the elongated spacer, the required cross&#8208;sectional fullerene&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon ratio for the superlattice could be achieved despite of different volume fractions of the blocks. The superlattice phase range is efficiently widened by the design principle of constructing LC molecules with a long spacer, which also provides a facile way to tailor novel superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ&#8208;Generation of Magnesium&#8208; and Calcium&#8208;Based Grignard Reagents for Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkaline&#8208;earth metals Mg and Ca are too inert for the direct metalation of primary and secondary amines. Consequently, activation prior to use is required. Alternatively, the Grignard reagents RMgX (R = alkyl, aryl, X = halide) can be applied in metalation of amines. However, such a straightforward procedure for the synthesis of alkylcalcium reagents is disadvantageous due to diverse side reactions, including Wurtz&#8208;type C&#8208;C coupling and ether degradation reactions. Therefore, suspensions of magnesium or calcium with amine can be treated in a smooth reaction with ethyl bromide in an ethereal solvent at room temperature. Intermediately formed RAeX (Ae = Mg, Ca) either metalates amines yielding the corresponding amides in an in situ&#8208;Grignard&#8208;Metalation&#8208;Method (iGMM) or adds across C=N bonds of imines in an in situ Grignard Addition Method (iGAM). The amides R&#8217;2N&#8208;AeX (Ae = Mg: Hauser bases) undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand exchange reactions yielding homoleptic Ae(NR&#8217;2)2 and potentially sparingly soluble AeX2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unified Redox Scale for All Solvents: Consistency and Gibbs Transfer Energies of Electrolytes from their Constituent Single Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have devised the unified redox scale EabsH2O, which is valid for all solvents. The necessary single ion Gibbs transfer energy between two different sol&#173;vents, which only can be determined with extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions so far, must clearly satisfy two essential conditions: First, the sum of the independent cation and anion values must give the Gibbs transfer energy of the salt they form. The latter is an observable and measurable without extra&#8208;thermo&#173;dynamic assumptions. Second, the values must be consistent for different solvent combinations. With this work, potentiometric measure&#173;ments on silver ions and on chloride ions show that both conditions are fulfilled using a salt bridge filled with the ionic liquid [N2225][NTf2]: if compared to the values resulting from known pKL values, the silver and chloride single ion magni&#173;tudes combine within a uncertainty of 1.5&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8211;1 to the directly measurable transfer magnitudes of the salt AgCl in all of the above given solvents as well as in methanol and ethanol. The resulting values are used to further develop the consistent unified redox potential scale EabsH2O that now allows to assess and compare redox potentials in and over six different solvents. We elaborate on its implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Benzotrisazulene via Trioxobenzotrisazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing odd&#8208;membered rings (such as pentagons or heptagons) are fascinating synthetic targets. A special case is the introduction of five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in form of an azulene unit at the same time. Azulene is an aromatic compounds known for its deep blue color, which is a result of its internal dipole moment. When azulene is embedded into PAHs it can change the optoelectronic properties of the PAH significantly. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a PAH containing three azulene units via reduction and elimination of its trioxo derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover and Fluorine&#8208;Specific Interactions in Metal Complexes of Terpyridines with Polyfluorocarbon Tails</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In coordination chemistry and materials science, terpyridine ligands are of great interest, due to their ability to form stable complexes with a broad range of transition metal ions. We report three terpyridine ligands containing different perfluorocarbon (PFC) tails on the backbone and the corresponding FeII and CoII complexes. The CoII complexes display spin crossover close to ambient temperature, and the nature of this spin transition is influenced by the length of the PFC tail on the ligand backbone. The electrochemical properties of the metal complexes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry revealing one oxidation and several reduction processes. Investigation of the fluorine specific interactions was performed by EPR measurements. Analysis of the EPR spectra of the complexes as microcrystalline powders and in solution reveals exchange&#8208;narrowed spectra without resolved hyperfine splittings arising from the 59Co nucleus, which suggests complex aggregation in solution mediated by interactions of the PFC tails. Interestingly, addition of perfluorooctanol in different ratios to the acetonitrile solution of the sample resulted in the disruption of the F &#160;F interactions of the tails. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of fluorine specific interactions in metal complexes through EPR spectroscopy, as exemplified by exchange narrowing.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circular Dichroism in Helical Tetrapyrrole Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the selective synthesis of nickel and copper complexes of 19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;bilatrien&#8208;1&#8208;one (H2TPBT), a molecule which crystallizes as a molecular helix of one&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;quarter turns with a 5.7&#160;&#197; radius and a 3.2&#160;&#197; pitch, and all 26 participating atoms being sp2&#8208;hybridized. UV/vis, ECD, ESR and cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal a strong interaction between metal and ligand and partial radical character when copper is coordinated instead of nickel. Strong ECD absorption in the 800 nm range is found which, using TD&#8208;DFT calculations as well as literature spectra, is shown to be highly be tunable both by metal coordination as well as variation of the aryl groups in the TPBT periphery. The radical character of the ligand in Cu(TPBT) enables rapid interconversion between (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;enantiomers, possibly via intermittent breakage of a Cu&#8208;N bond. The 19&#8208;benzoyl group kinetically stabilizes enantiopure (M/P)&#8208;Ni(TPBT). The results are interpreted with regards to application as circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors as well as the chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect which is currently lacking a concise theoretical model.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Heterocyclic Recombination of Aziridine and Diazetidine for the Synthesis of Imidazolidine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. If a catalyst has multiple functions, such as inducing bond cleavage and formation, it can streamline multi&#8208;step transformations. Herein, we report the Cu catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine. Mechanistically, Cu catalyzes the conversion of diazetidine into the corresponding imine, which then reacts with aziridine to form imidazolidine. The scope is sufficiently wide to form various imidazolidines, as many functional groups are compatible with the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug&#8208;like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on&#8208;DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we disclosed an unprecedented photochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboxylative Buchwald Hartwig amination to access a wide range of aryl carbamate derivatives. This reaction is performed under mild condition of temperature and atmospheric pressure of CO2 starting from commercially available (hetero)aryl iodides/bromides derivatives and alkyl amines preventing the formation of hazardous and/or toxic waste. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigation including stochiometric experiments as well as DFT calculations allows us to shed the light on the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4&#8208;haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl&#8208;appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl3. Detailed analysis suggested that the observed attractive anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interactions predominantly originated from solvation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Clickable Acylated Glycerol Probes as Chemical Tools for Tracking Glycerolipid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs are used as probes to label glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3, with a relatively short acyl chain, infiltrates natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 deactivates phospholipid tagging and focuses labeling on neutral lipids.







Abstract
We report the use of clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs as probes for the labeling of glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. Incorporation of azide tags onto the glycerol region was pursued to develop probes that would label glycerolipids, in which the click tag would not be removed through processes including acyl chain and headgroup remodeling. Analysis of clickable MAG probes containing acyl chains of different length resulted in widely variable cell imaging and cytotoxicity profiles. Based on these results, we focused on a probe bearing a short acyl chain (C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3) that was found to infiltrate natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Alternatively, strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 served to deactivate phospholipid tagging and focus labeling on neutral lipids. This work shows that lipid metabolic labeling profiles can be tuned based on probe structures and provides valuable tools for evaluating alterations to lipid metabolism in cells.

         <title>Viscous, Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Macromolecular Adhesives for Effective Bonding in Seawater</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular adhesives were synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. The Hofmeister effect effectively improve the adhesive performance of the polymeric adhesives in nature seawater.







Abstract
Deployment of adhesives in natural seawater to in&#8197;situ bonds is urgently needed in engineering fields. However, stable adhesion in natural seawater remains a challenge due to the turbulent environment and high ion concentration. Herein, we reported a viscous, macromolecular underwater adhesive enhanced by Hofmeister effect (EHUA) for practical application in dynamic seawater. EHUA was synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. After transferred into seawater, the solvent of EHUA was exchanged to seawater, and thereby hydrogen bonds inside the adhesive were activated and enhanced by Hofmeister effect. We demonstrated EHUA can adhere on the surface in turbulent seawater, and the adhesive strength could reach 1.691&#8197;MPa. In addition, the adhesives also exhibited long&#8208;term storage stability and convenient recyclability. These fascinating properties enable adhesives to seal leaky pipelines, repair damaged ships and construct buildings in turbulent seawater. This work may open an avenue for the design of adhesives for seawater environments.

         <title>Cationic Solution and Solid&#8208;State Emitters &#8211; Robust Imaging Agents for Cells, Bacteria, and Protists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be positive for imaging A series of luminescent cationic solution and solid&#8208;state emitters have been synthesized and applied for bioimaging purposes. In addition to low toxicity and facile synthesis, these emitters revealed striking uptake into biological samples such as human cells, bacteria as well as protists with high contrast during the fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
A library of eight different cationic emitters with emission properties in solution and in solid&#8208;state (solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; SSSE) is presented. These compounds, bearing either ammonium or pyridinium groups, have been investigated regarding their photophysical properties as well as their potential application in biological imaging. Besides high quantum yields as well as a high degree of stability during the imaging process, it was additionally revealed that a broad range of biological targets can be addressed, such as different bacterial strains, human cells as well as protists. The reported SSSE approach employing the mentioned robust emitters for biological imaging, will contribute to a rapid and facile way to design and apply affordable emitters with outstanding properties. Additionally, these emitters will overcome the drawbacks of classical luminophores and agents featuring well&#8208;known aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties.

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and physicochemical studies of two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units. They were used as scaffolds to construct thiaborin&#8208;based BODIPY singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers with evident potential for use as photocatalysts.







Abstract
A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron extended [1,4]thiaborins annulated with two benzothiophene units has been developed. The central thiaborin rings of the boracycles obtained exhibit different electronic properties; this is reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from 1LE and 1CT transitions. Strong near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77&#8197;K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and the formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates electron transfer to a 1CT state followed by a transition to the 3LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of spiro thiaborin&#8208;BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77&#8201;% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5&#8197;h with only 0.05&#8201;%&#8201;mol catalyst load.

Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates electron transfer to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CT state followed by a transition to the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of &lt;i&gt;spiro&lt;/i&gt; thiaborin-BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet-oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77&#8201;% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5&#8197;h with only 0.05&#8201;%&#8201;mol catalyst load.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman bioorthogonal imaging: Varying the electronics of the aryl end&#8208;caps of bisaryl diynes (BADY) widened the palette for multiplexed Raman imaging. Electron&#8208;poor end&#8208;caps revealed the covalent reactivity of the aryl&#8208;capped diynes, opening new avenues for covalent Raman imaging.







Abstract
Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8722;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;DY tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208; rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8211;2243&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;DY tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8211;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;DY tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.

Mechanistic insights into enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide catalyzed by Cu and chiral phosphoric acid with computational prediction of various phosphoric acids as promising co&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Density functional theory computations reveal mechanistic insights into Cu and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide. The O&#8722;O bond homolysis of tert&#8208;butyl 4&#8208;phenylbutaneperoxoate was found to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step with a total free energy barrier of 19.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The enantioconvergent amination is realized to obtain the same intermediate through prochiral carbon atom. The order and mode of hydrogen atom transferred by CPA and tert&#8208;butyloxy have a significant influence on the enantioselectivity and energy barriers. The olefinic side product generated by &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is 9.9&#8197;kcal/mol thermodynamically less favourable. A series of phosphoric acids are predicted as promising co&#8208;catalysts with lower barriers for O&#8722;O bond homolysis.

         <title>Reversible Transition between Discrete and 1D Infinite Architectures: A Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cu(I) Complex with a Flexible Disilane&#8208;Bridged Bis(pyridine) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive molecular structure based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridyl) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there were two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;173&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of the disilane&#8208;bridged ligand.







Abstract
A thermoresponsive structural change based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridine) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there are two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;173&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of the ligand. Cu&#8722;I bond formation is observed upon cooling the sample from &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;170&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition progression was clarified by DSC, VT&#8208;PXRD, and VT&#8208;photoluminescence measurements and indicated a reversible temperature&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Observation on a VT&#8208;stage using a high&#8208;speed camera showed crystal cracking during single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transitions between these polymorphic forms.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from Boswellia papyrifera Resins Allowing Structural Revision of Misleading Structures from the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boswellia papyrifera resins have had a long journey from 1500 BC. In 1966, the cembranoid skeleton become a part of the journey towards chemical investigations, and several cembranoids have been reported, but there is still uncertainty about their structure elucidation. In this study, we isolated 38 macrocyclic cembranoids from B. papyrifera resins, including six whose accepted structures needed to be revised. The study describes 25 single&#8208;crystal analyses, during which misleading factors in the stereochemistry determinations over the past 70 years were found. In addition, in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300559) Y.&#8208;X. Cheng and co&#8208;workers propose a biosynthetic pathway and briefly discuss SAR studies.

         <title>Nonorthogonal Cascade Catalysis in Multicompartment Micelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicompartment micelles (MCMs) containing acid and base sites in discrete domains are prepared from poly(norbornene)&#8208;based amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers in aqueous media. The acid and base sites are localized in different compartments of the micelle, enabling the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization &#8211; Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Computational simulations using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) elucidated the bottlebrush composition required to effectively site&#8208;isolate the nonorthogonal catalysts. This contribution presents MCMs as a new class of nanostructures for one&#8208;pot multistep nonorthogonal cascade catalysis, laying the groundwork for the isolation of three or more incompatible catalysts to synthesize value&#8208;added compounds in a single reaction vessel, in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C7&#8208;H Arylation of Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C7&#8208;Arylated pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines are important structural motifs with profound applications in drug and material research. Here we report a general and straighforward synthesis of these bi(hetero)aryls via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8208;H arylation, employing low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the aryl source. The catalytic system is robust and covers a wide substrate scope regarding heteroarenes as well as (hetero)aryl chlorides, with possible extension to the C&#8208;H arylation of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines. This study also presents a rare example of using (hetero)aryl chlorides for the direct C&#8208;H arylation of six&#8208;membered heteroarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Zn+2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrosilylation of C=C double and C&#8801;C triple bonds is one of the most widely used processes in organosilicon chemistry, mostly catalyzed by Pt&#8208;based complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of dicationic Zn+2&#8208;based complex with a tripodal tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand, which was found to be a highly chemoselective catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of alkynes. Mechanistic studies revealed that unlike typical Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions where the key step is the activation of Si&#8722;H bond, this system catalyzes hydrosilylation reaction through the activation of C&#8801;C triple bonds, which presumably is the reason for its high chemoselectivity. Remarkably, the hydrosilylation of alkynes could be performed in the presence of alkenes and other functional groups that remained intact in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactive P&#8210;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breaking the centrosymmetry of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) by one meta connection, leads to bright emission in the typically non&#8208;fluorescent smaller derivatives, conserving their size dependent emissive properties. Using the building block strategy for [n]CPPs, different nitrile substituted meta[n]CPPs (n = 6, 8, 10) have been prepared. The nitrile substituent offers a convenient handle for functional group conversions (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, aldehyde, as well as 1H&#8208;tetrazole). Besides the synthetic work, the photophysical properties of these novel m[n]CPP derivatives have been characterized. Additionally, the host&#8208;guest ability of cyano&#8208;m[10]CPP has been explored by studying its complexation with fullerene C60. These insights open new applications of meta[n]CPPs as fluorophore in synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences as well as biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate a&#8208;diazoisoindole and a&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate a&#8208;diazoisoindole and a&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Temperature&#8208;Gating and Ion Conductivity Control of Grafted Anodic Aluminum Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have been widely applied to porous surfaces. Permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels modified with stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, however, have been less investigated. In this work, we demonstrate the permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates modified with thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes. By surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP), PNIPAM brushes are successfully grafted onto the hexagonally packed cylindrical nanopores of AAO templates. The surface hydrophilicities of the membranes can be reversibly altered because of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of the PNIPAM polymer brushes. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the temperature&#8208;gating behaviors of the AAO&#8208;g&#8208;PNIPAM membranes exhibit larger impedance changes than those of the pure AAO membranes at higher temperatures because of the aggregation of the grafted PNIPAM chains. The reversible surface properties caused by the extended and collapsed states of the polymer chains are also demonstrated by dye release tests. The smart thermo&#8208;gated and ion&#8208;controlled nanoporous membranes are suitable for future smart membrane applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfide&#8208;Directed Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylic sp2 and Benzylic sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H Activation for the Construction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Medium&#8208;Ring System</title>

         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;directed sp2 and sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H activation is a new strategy for the construction of a sulfur&#8208;containing medium&#8208;ring system. Cationic Ir&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation to alkynes gave dihydrobenzothiepines and dibenzo[b,f]thiepines.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed transformations initiated by sulfur&#8208;directed vinylic sp2 and benzylic sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H activation are disclosed that achieve the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered systems. Allyl 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl sulfides were transformed into dihydrobenzothiepines in 30&#8211;95&#8201;% yield, and 2&#8208;alkynylaryl 2&#8208;tolyl sulfides were converted into dibenzo[b,f]thiepines in 57&#8211;95&#8201;% yield along with double bond isomerization. In both reactions, the combination of Ir catalyst and sulfide moiety was a key to the facile cyclization.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Substituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salts as Useful Synthetic Synthons: Access to Triazenyl Radicals and Staudinger Type Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts are useful synthetic synthons for a range of follow&#8208;up chemistry including the synthesis of triazenyl&#8208;based radicals. Mesoionic carbenes play a crucial role in the stabilization of these radicals.







Abstract
Mesoionic carbenes (MIC) are a popular class of compound that are heavily investigated at the moment. The access to cationic MICs, and the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals are two highly attractive fields that have hardly been explored until now. Here the synthesis and characterisation of three different cationic azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts, used as building blocks for studying their reactivity towards triphenylphosphine are reported, where the reactivity is dependent on the nature of the starting triazolium salt. Furthermore, the cationic triazolium salts were used to develop a series of unsymmetrical MIC&#8208;triazene&#8208;NHC/MIC&#8217; compounds, which can be readily converted to the radical form either by electrochemical or chemical methods. These radicals, which display NIR electrochromism, were investigated using a battery of techniques such as electrochemistry, UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the MIC plays an important role in the stabilization of the triazenyl radical, particularly in a competitive role vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis their NHC counterparts. These results shed new light on the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals, and possibly also on their &#960;&#8208;accepting ability.

         <title>Stability of Catalytic Centres in Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Di&#8208; and Oligonuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water reduction: This review is focused on the catalytically active metal centre for photocatalytic water reduction and summarizes the main decomposition pathways turning a molecular photocatalyst into a heterogeneous, colloid&#8208;based catalytic system. Moreover, strategies to obtain molecularly operating oligonuclear photocatalysts are presented.







Abstract
A review. In recent decades, mimicking natural photosynthesis by artificial photocatalysis represented a major research direction with the ultimate goal of reducing fossil fuel consumption through efficient solar energy harvesting. To transfer molecular photocatalysis from the lab scale to an industrially relevant process, it is important to overcome instability problems of the catalysts during light&#8208;driven operation. As it is well&#8208;known that many of the typically utilized noble metal&#8208;based catalytic centres (e.&#8201;g. Pt and Pd) undergo particle formation during (photo)catalysis and thus switch the whole process from a homogeneous into a heterogeneous one, an understanding of the factors governing particle formation is crucially needed. The review therefore focuses on di&#8208; and oligonuclear photocatalysts bearing a range of different bridging ligand architectures for drawing structure&#8208;catalyst&#8208;stability relationships in light&#8208;driven intramolecular reductive catalysis. In addition, ligand effects at the catalytic centre and their implications for catalytic activity in intermolecular systems will be discussed, as will important insights into the future design of operationally stable catalysts.

         <title>Accelerated Solid Phase Glycan Synthesis: ASGS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and efficient: High shear stirring accelerates glycan synthesis on solid support and enables efficient and fast glycosylation that competes even with glycosyl donor hydrolysis in an open vessel.







Abstract
Solid phase synthesis is the most dominant approach for the preparation of biological oligomers as it enables the introduction of monomers iteratively. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharides is not trivial. Solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide assembly is a slow process performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires an inert gas atmosphere, and demands high excess of glycosyl donors. The process is done in special synthesizers and poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion&#8208;independent hydrolysis of the activated donors. High shear stirring is a new way to accelerate solid phase synthesis. The efficient mixing ensures that reactive intermediates can diffuse faster to the solid support thereby increasing the kinetics of the reactions. We report here a stirring&#8208;based accelerated solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to perform diffusion&#8208;dependent glycosylation in a short reaction time. We minimized the use of glycosyl donors and the need to use an inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, assembly steps are performed continuously, and full glycosylation cycles are completed in minutes.

         <title>Construction of Ternary Bismuth&#8208;Based Heterojunction by Using (BiO)2CO3 as Electron Bridge for Highly Efficient Degradation of Phenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction was fabricated. It exhibited excellent photocatalytic performances for phenol degradation, which was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, and the presence of (BiO)2CO3 that performed as an electron bridge to enable the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6 to be shortened, greatly promoting the efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed a Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8&#8201;% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68&#8201;% within 180&#8197;min under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, more importantly, the presence of (BiO)2CO3 as an electron bridge greatly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which is verified by trapping experiments, electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy (ESR) results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion and environmental protection.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small yet brightly emitting fluorophores should find fundamental and practical applications in both academic and industrial settings. Herein, we report tetrahydrobenzodifuran as the core architecture to create novel single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;containing Fusicoccins</title>

         <dc:description>The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, we focused on the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma isoform, which possesses a unique Cys38, and designed a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 4&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma&#160;selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3z in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma&#160;in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ERalpha, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria via Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their long history and their synthetic potential underlined by various recent advances, radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling reactions have so far only rarely been exploited for the functionalization of biomolecules, and no examples yet exist for their application in live cells &#8208; although natural thiols show widespread occurrence therein. By taking advantage of the particular cellular conditions of mitochondria in cancer cells, we herein demonstrate that radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling represents a powerful reaction principle for the selective targeting of these organelles. Within our studies, fluorescently labelled reactive alkyne probes were investigated, whereat the fluorescent moiety was chosen to enable both mitochondria accumulation as well as highly sensitive detection. After preliminary studies under cell&#8208;free conditions the most promising alkyne&#8208;dye conjugates were evaluated in various cellular experiments comprising analysis by flow cytometry and microscopy. All in all, these results pave the way for improved future therapeutic strategies relying on live&#8208;cell compatibility and selectivity among cellular compartments.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based AIE Supramolecular Polymer Networks Exhibiting Various Fluorescence to Achieve Visible Surveillance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it&#8217;s known evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, we introduced a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8208;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast visualized conformational transition of polyphenylacetylenes with stepwise tunable circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure&#8208;based smart CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules can be obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its fancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (~60 kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by the X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work would provide a way to the design of highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>From Proton to Boron: The Lewis Analogs of Protonated Br&#248;nsted Super Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions were scouted in details with the aim of synthesizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weakly coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Isolation and characterization of highly reactive intermediates are crucial to understand the nature of chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the reactivity of weakly coordinating anions (WCA), usually used to stabilized cationic super electrophiles are of fundamental interest. When a variety of WCA are known to form stable &#963;&#8208;complexes with a proton, inducing Br&#248;nsted super acidity, bis&#8208;coordinated weak&#8208;coordinated anions are much more elusive and considered as long&#8208;sought reactive species. In this work, the chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions were scouted in details with the aim of synthetizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weak coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state and exhibit unique structures and reactivities.

         <title>Massively Parallel Double&#8208;Selection Workflow for the Evolution of Molecular Switches Based on Surface&#8208;Display in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Lpp&#8208;ompA surface&#8208;display system is used for the selection of riboswitches in E. coli. Cells are either selected through their ability to bind to magnetic beads or counter&#8208;selected by the deleterious effects of the surface&#8208;display system overexpression. This dual selection system is massively parallel and allows accelerating the screening process required for the evolution of molecular switches from vast libraries.







Abstract
Microbial surface display of proteins is a versatile method for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Herein, the use of a surface display system in E. coli for the evolution of a riboswitch from an RNA aptamer is presented. To this end, a streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide (SBP) is displayed at the bacterial surface, which can be used for massively parallel selection using a magnetic separation system. Coupling gene expression from a riboswitch library to the display of SBP hence allows selection of library members that express strongly in the presence of a ligand. As excessive SBP expression leads to bacterial growth inhibition, it can be used to negatively select against leaky riboswitches expressing in the absence of ligand. Based on this principle, we devise a double selection workflow that enables quick selection of functional riboswitches with a comparatively low screening workload. The efficiency of our protocol by re&#8208;discovering a previously isolated theophylline riboswitch from a library was demonstrated, as well as a new riboswitch that is similar in performance, but slightly more responsive at low theophylline concentrations. Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre&#8208;screening of large molecular libraries.

         <title>Enabling Ultrahigh Surface Area of Covalently&#8208;linked Organic Framework for Boosted CO2 Capture: An Air Liquid Interfacial Plasma as Post&#8208;furnishing Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlining features of the presented work focuses on development of a covalently&#8208;linked organic framework (COF) following a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure. Successively, a facile, economical and scalable post&#8208;modification approach, i.&#8201;e., air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is adopted to explicitly amplifies the surface area to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m2/g which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake performance up to 67&#8201;%.







Abstract
The cognitive intent of a highly ordered and robust adsorbent is extremely sensible and, in this context, Covalent Organic Framework (COF) materials have significantly burgeoned their scope in diverse applications. Herein, a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure is presented to construct a covalent framework with an ultrahigh surface area of 1428&#8197;m2/g that shows active adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) at variable temperature ranges. Moreover, a facile scalably controlled post&#8208;synthetic air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is substantiated that explicitly amplifies the surface area of the pristine framework even to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m2/g. The post&#8208;synthetic plasma approach presented here led to the rapid enhancement of the surface area of the pristine COF by 43&#8201;%, which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake up to 67&#8201;%. Hence, the current study may open up a new frontier in the design as well as fine&#8208;tune the properties of the covalent framework that unfolds the advanced outlook in addressing the challenges of CO2 capture.

Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase solvation of halides by 1,3&#8208;butadiene has been studied via a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory. Photoelectron spectra for X&#8722;&#8943;(C4H6)n (X=Cl, Br, I where n=1&#8208;3, 1&#8211;3 and 1&#8211;7 respectively) are presented. For all complexes, the calculated structures indicate that butadiene is bound in a bidentate fashion through hydrogen&#8208;bonding, with the chloride complex showing the greatest degree of stabilisation of the internal C&#8722;C rotation of cis&#8208;butadiene. In both Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; complexes, the first solvation shell is shown to be at least 
 from the vertical detachment energies (VDEs), however for I&#8722;, increases in the VDE may suggest a metastable, partially filled, first solvation shell for 
 and a complete shell at

Cyclization: A mild, room temperature oxidative cyclization of 2&#8208;substituted anilines that accesses a broad range of medium&#8208;ring N&#8208;heterocycles via radical intermediates is reported.







Abstract
The development of an efficient process that produces bioactive medium&#8208;sized N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds from 2&#8208;substituted anilines using either iodosobenzene or (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)&#8208;benzene is reported. The tether between the sulfonamide and the aryl group can be varied to access dihydroacridine&#8208;, dibenzazepine&#8208;, or dibenzazocine scaffolds. While substitution on the aniline portion is limited to electron&#8208;neutral&#8208; or electron&#8208;poor groups, a broader range of functional groups are tolerated on the ortho&#8208;aryl substituent and site selective C&#8722;NAr bond formation can be achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that medium&#8208;ring formation occurs via radical reactive intermediates.

Single&#8208;molecule magnets: The first examples of germole&#8208;ligated lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets are reported, with markedly different properties found for the dysprosium and erbium versions.







Abstract
The first germole&#8208;ligated single&#8208;molecule magnets are reported, with contrasting properties found for the near&#8208;linear sandwich complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;COT)Ln(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe]&#8722;, where Ln=Dy (1Dy) or Er (1Er), COT is cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl and CpGe is [GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;. Whereas 1Er has an energy barrier of 120(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in zero applied field and open hysteresis loops up to 10&#8197;K, the relaxation in 1Dy is characterized by quantum tunneling within the ground state.

         <title>Wettability&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Array with Subnanochannels Enables Efficient Separation of Mono&#8208;/Multivalent Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF array membranes with subnanochannels were prepared by using confined interfacial reaction for selective separation of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ions. The key is regulating the location of oil/water interfaces though reducing the difference of contact angle of oil and water. Due to the diversity of porous materials, the presented strategy is expected to provide new possibilities for the development of advanced membranes with subnanochannels for practical applications.







Abstract
Achieving efficient separation of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ions is essential in various fields, yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels that exhibit high selectivity and ion permeability in the sieving of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ion was developed. Specifically, we used confined interfacial reaction at room temperature to synthesis the MOF array inside the micrometer through&#8208;pores of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane. The location of the oil/water interface was regulated by adjusting the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of MOF crystals, we were able to effectively separate monovalent metal ions from multivalent metal ions with selectivity reaching up to 3930&#177;373 (e.g., Li+/Zr4+). The fluxes of Li+ ions were observed to be as high as 1.97&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. The MOF array&#8208;based membrane with subnanochannels that we have developed exhibits great promise for applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines, and other related fields.

         <title>New Hypothesis Insight of Structural Properties on Four Tau Peptide Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Origin from the Histidine Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural properties and aggregation tendency of four Tau peptide fragments are subject to significant modulation by histidine behaviors, including its tautomeric and protonation states. Notably, the R1, R2, and R4 fragments exhibit a preference for unstable and flexible structural features, whereas only R3(&#1013;&#948;) displays a propensity for stable three &#946;&#8208;strand structures.

During protein folding and misfolding, structural properties and aggregation tendency can be significantly influenced by histidine behaviors (tautomeric behaviors and protonation behaviors). The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8722;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#1013;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#1013;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3&#8201;%) with three &#946;&#8208;strand structures in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures at I4&#8208;K6 and I24&#8208;H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at G19&#8208;L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#1013;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H&#8208;bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3&#8201;%&#8211;44.7&#8201;%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#1013;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by Hexadentate Polyimidazole Ligands: Modeling Metal Binding by Calprotectin Site 2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective binding of manganese(II) ions is a challenging problem with potential biomedical applications. We have designed a series of bioinspired hexadentate chelating ligands that allow for systematic, sterically&#8208;controlled tuning of the ligand cavity size in order to explore the feasibility of size&#8208;based selectivity for Mn2+ binding over other first&#8208;row divalent transition metal ions.







Abstract
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn2+ with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn2+ binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese&#8208;sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn2+ and Zn2+ binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn2+ over Zn2+, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn2+ selectivity.

Bi Lewis acidic: Donor&#8208;free cationic bismuth compounds readily coordinate Lewis basic substrates including arenes, phosphanes, and isonitriles, and degrade the weakly coordinating counter&#8208;anion [PF6]&#8211;. Counterintuitively, an increase in steric bulk around bismuth can increase the Lewis acidity. In the graphic, a bismuth kraken grabs Lewis basic substrates, solving scientific puzzles about bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity.
