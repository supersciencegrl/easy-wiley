         <title>Direct Crystallization of Diamine Radical Cations: Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Formation from the Reaction of Triphenylamine with TiCl4, TiBr4, or SnCl4 vs Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation with SbCl5&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We report the direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form proceeding through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of a novel C&#8208;N bond. While the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Here, we have demonstrated the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine, and observed the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used. The radical species are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208; Ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Road Toward More Efficient Biocompatible Two&#8208;Photon Excitable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon absorption is a widely use process for bioimaging, as it allows to go deeper in tissue than conventional absorption and also limit photodamages. Unfortunately, classical dyes possess poor two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections. In this work, we developed a series of quadrupolar dyes and showed that these biocompatible probes exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and are therefore good candidates for two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.

         <title>S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Benzothioate (TFBT): A KF&#8208;Based Reagent for Nucleophilic Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No need for HF: S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)benzothioate (TFBT), which is easily synthesized by using KF as the only fluorine source, has been developed as an inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and user&#8208;friendly trifluoromethylthiolation reagent. TFBT reagent can readily release SCF3&#8722; with various counterions. The synthetic application of TFBT is demonstrated by trifluoromethylthiolation&#8208;halogenation of arynes, bis(trifluoromethylthiolation)&#8208;halogenation of 1,2&#8208;benzdiynes, nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, deoxytrifluoromethylthiolation of alcohols, and cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and vinyl boronic acids.

         <title>The Spin Modulation Stimulated Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over LaCoO3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin modulation strategy is proposed to improve the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity for perovskite oxide LaCoO3 (LCO), which was realized by adjusting the high temperature thermal reduction time. The prepared catalyst with optimized high temperature thermal reduction time of 60&#8197;min (LCO&#8208;60) exhibits more appropriate eg orbital occupation and shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity under an external magnetic field.







Abstract
Perovskite is a promising non&#8208;noble catalyst and has been widely investigated for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, there is still serious lack of valid approaches to further enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, we propose a spin state modulation strategy to improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of typical perovskite material of LaCoO3. Specifically, the electronic configuration transition was realized by a simple high temperature thermal reduction process. M&#8208;H hysteresis loop results reveal that the reduction treatment can produce more unpaired electrons in 3d orbit by promoting the electron transitions of Co from low spin state to high spin state, and thus lead to the increase of the spin polarization. Electrochemical measurements show that the catalytic performance of LaCoO3 is strongly dependent on its electronic configuration. With the optimized reduction treatment, the overpotential for the OER process in 0.5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte solution at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density was 396&#8197;mV, significantly lower than that of the original state. Furthermore, it can mediate efficient OER with an overpotential of 383&#8197;mV under an external magnetic field, which is attributed to the appropriate electron filling. Our results show that electron spin state regulation is a new way to boost the OER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Effect of gem&#8208;difluorination on the key physicochemical properties relevant to medicinal chemistry: the case of functionalized cycloalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physico&#8208;chemical properties important to drug discovery (pKa  , LogP, and aqueous solubility), as well as metabolic stability, were studied for a series of functionalized  gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts to evaluate the impact of the fluorination. It was found that the influence of the CF2&#160;moiety on the acidity/basicity of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines was defined by inductive the effect of the fluorine atoms and was nearly the same for acyclic and cyclic aliphatic compounds. Lipophilicity and aqueous solubility followed more complex trends and were affected by the position of the fluorine atoms, ring size, and even the nature of the functional group present; also, significant differences were found for the acyclic and cyclic series. Also,  gem&#8208;difluorination either did not affect or slightly improved the metabolic stability of the corresponding model derivatives.

It was found that the influence of the CF2&#160;moiety on the acidity/basicity of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines was defined by inductive the effect of the fluorine atoms and was nearly the same for acyclic and cyclic aliphatic compounds. Lipophilicity and aqueous solubility followed more complex trends and were affected by the position of the fluorine atoms, ring size, and even the nature of the functional group present; also, significant differences were found for the acyclic and cyclic series. Also,  gem-difluorination either did not affect or slightly improved the metabolic stability of the corresponding model derivatives. The presented results can be used as a guide for rational drug design employing fluorine and establish the first chapter in a catalog of the key  in vitro  properties of fluorinated cycloalkanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F plus: The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacids XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in monoprotonated and diprotonated species: the first examples of a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. Surprisingly, the C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated cations are considerably shortened.







Abstract
The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C4H3F2O2]+[MF6]&#8722; (M=As, Sb) and [C4H2X2F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C4H3F2O2]+[SbF6]&#8722; as well as for [C4H4F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (M=As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C4H4F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;HF]2+ and [C4H3F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF]+ at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, electrostatic potential (ESP) maps combined with natural population analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge&#8208;related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Driven Systematic Synthesis of Coordination Polymers with Non&#8208;centrosymmetric Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept article, a systematic method to synthesize coordination polymers with macroscopic non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures by using chiral organic ligands as structure directing agents is provided. Our survey and analysis contain material design strategies, structure&#8208;driven SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized. The topic could provide new insight into the target design and systematic synthesis of new functional materials with intriguing chemical and physical properties.







Abstract
Chirality is an important concept in chemistry revealing intriguing optical properties such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), etc. As one of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) classes, chiral materials with extended structures may exhibit unique nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, such as second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). In this Concept article, a series of recently discovered NCS coordination polymers (CPs) from use of carefully designed chiral organic ligands are reviewed. Combining several metal cations such as lanthanides, lead, zinc, and cadmium with rigid chiral ligands has resulted in interesting CPs with both polar and nonpolar structures. Detailed structures, SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships are provided. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized.

Abstract
Phase transitions in molecular crystals are often determined by intermolecular interactions. The cage complex of [Co(C12H30N8)]3+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8201;NO3&#8722; is reported to undergo a disorder&#8208;order phase transition at Tc1 &#8776;133&#8197;K upon cooling. Temperature&#8208;dependent neutron and synchrotron diffraction experiments revealed satellite reflections in addition to main reflections in the diffraction patterns below Tc1. The modulation wave vector varies as function of temperature and locks in at Tc3&#8776;98&#8197;K. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal symmetry lowers from hexagonal to monoclinic in the incommensurately modulated phases in Tc1&lt;T&lt;Tc3. Distinctive levels of competitions: trade&#8208;off between longer N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and shorter C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds; steric constraints to dense C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds give rise to pronounced modulation of the basic structure. Severely frustrated crystal packing in the incommensurate phase is precursor to optimal balance of intermolecular interactions in the lock&#8208;in phase.

         <dc:description>
Catalysis on wheels: The beneficial effects of phosphine oxide additives on cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification enable the cobalt catalyst to &#8220;skate&#8221; from substrates (left) to products (right). The promoting effect further enables a milder and more general reaction, allowing a lower temperature and syngas (H2/CO) pressure as well as a broader scope.

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;(Zn)phthalocyanine conjugates were afforded by mixing electron&#8208;donating 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine corroles with an electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanine. Investigation of the complexation by NMR, absorption, and fluorescence essays revealed binding constants as high as 106&#8201;m&#8722;1. Introducing non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;phthalocyanine linkages induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and charge&#8208;transfer when compared to covalently linked equivalents.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pc systems. At the forefront was the coordination between a 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine Cor and a ZnPc. The complexation was corroborated in a combination of NMR, absorption, and fluorescence assays, and revealed association with binding constants as high as 106&#8197;m&#8722;1. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies evidenced that regardless of exciting Cor or Pc, the charge&#8208;separated state evolved efficiently in both cases, followed by a slow charge&#8208;recombination to reinstate the ground state. The introduction of non&#8208;covalent linkages between Cor and Pc induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and transfer of charges when compared with covalently linked Cor&#8208;Pc conjugates.

         <dc:description>
Ferritin protein cages self&#8208;assemble electrostatically with cationic pillararenes into porous crystalline framework structures. The frameworks can simultaneously host inorganic and organic pollutants&#8212;the protein cage shows uptake of heavy metals such as CdII and AsV. In contrast, the pillar[5]arene shows selective recognition of methyl orange, a common organic dye. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Kostiainen et&#8197;al.

         <title>Disordered low molecular weight spiropyran exhibiting photoregulated adhesion ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to ~8 MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Carbonyl Alkylative Amination Enabled by Titanium Dioxide Mediated Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination has been developed that proceeds via photoredox catalysis. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25 nm) as photocatalyst allows for efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveals a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;  b  ]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates execution of affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate&#8208;affinity&#8208;based Ab ligand featuring a 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S&#8208;aryl thioester to label full&#8208;length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide&#8208;labeled Ab (N  3  &#8208;Ab) quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity. Click reactions enabled precise addition of biotin, fluorophore, and a pharmacological agent to the purified N  3  &#8208;Abs. The resulting immunoconjugate showed effective cytotoxicity against targeted cells. Bioorthogonal traceless design and reagentless purification allow for this strategy to be a powerful tool to engineer native antibodies amenable to therapeutic intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands in enantioselective gold catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally&#8208;substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95:5 er.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential visible light&#8208;induced reactions using different photocatalysts: Transformation of furans into 2&#8208;pyridones via &#947;&#8208;lactams using a new ring expansion reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer &amp; electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8208;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Based Triimidosulfite Cages as Versatile Precursors for Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium and sodium cages [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2) and [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) serve as precursors to give f&#8208;metal single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM). Especially, the sodium precursor 2 represents an ideal candidate and the subsequent dysprosium SMM [ClDy{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] (6) displays an energy barrier Ueff of 513&#8197;cm&#8722;1, a frequency dependency of the dynamic out&#8208;of&#8208;phase susceptibility up to 60&#8197;K and a butterfly hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.







Abstract
Based on the potassium [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)&#8208;K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1) and sodium precursors [S(tBuN)3(thf)3&#8208;Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) and [(tmeda)3S&#8208;{Na3(NtBu)3S}2] (4) the syntheses and magnetic properties of three mixed metal triimidosulfite based alkali&#8208;lanthanide&#8208;metal&#8208;cages [(tBuNH)Dy{K(0.5tmeda)}2{(NtBu)3S}2]n (5) and [ClLn{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] with Ln=Dy (6), Er (7) are reported. The corresponding potassium (1) and sodium (2&#8211;4) based cages are characterized through XRD and NMR experiments. Preventing lithium chloride co&#8208;complexation led to a significant increase of SMM performance to previously reported sulfur&#8208;nitrogen ligands. The subsequent DyIII&#8208;complexes 5 and 6 display slow relaxation of magnetization at zero field, with relaxation barriers U=77.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 5, 512.9 and 316.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 6, respectively. Significantly, the latter complex 6 also exhibits a butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.

         <title>Capture of Gaseous Iodine in Isoreticular Zirconium&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;n Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Influence of Amino Functionalization, DFT Calculations, Raman and EPR Spectroscopic Investigation</title>

         <dc:description>
Conversion of I2 into I3&#8722; species trapped within UiO&#8208;n. The adsorption of gaseous iodine in UiO&#8208;n MOF&#8208;like materials has been systematically studied by analyzing kinetic curves. They show the conversion of trapped I2 into anionic species I3&#8722;, which is enhanced by the existence of amino groups functionalizing the organic linkers.







Abstract
A series of Zr&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n MOF materials (n=66, 67, 68) have been studied for iodine capture. Gaseous iodine adsorption was collected kinetically from a home&#8208;made set&#8208;up allowing the continuous measurement of iodine content trapped within UiO&#8208;n compounds, with organic functionalities (&#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;(OH)2, &#8722;NO2, &#8722;NH2, (&#8722;NH2)2, &#8722;CH2 NH2) by in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This study emphasizes the role of the amino groups attached to the aromatic rings of the ligands connecting the {Zr6O4(OH)4} brick. In particular, the preferential interaction of iodine with lone&#8208;pair groups, such as amino functions, has been experimentally observed and is also based on DFT calculations. Indeed, higher iodine contents were systematically measured for amino&#8208;functionalized UiO&#8208;66 or UiO&#8208;67, compared to the pristine material (up to 1211&#8197;mg/g for UiO&#8208;67&#8208;(NH2)2). However, DFT calculations revealed the highest computed interaction energies for alkylamine groups (&#8722;CH2NH2) in UiO&#8208;67 (&#8722;128.5&#8197;kJ/mol for the octahedral cavity), and pointed out the influence of this specific functionality compared with that of an aromatic amine. The encapsulation of iodine within the pore system of UiO&#8208;n materials and their amino&#8208;derivatives has been analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy. We showed that a systematic conversion of molecular iodine (I2) species into anionic I&#8722; ones, stabilized as I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I2 or I3&#8722; complexes within the MOF cavities, occurs when I2@UiO&#8208;n samples are left in ambient light.

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new unsymmetric dicationic diboranes were synthesized and characterized by substitution reactions of two triflato groups by a phosphino&#8208;pyridine double Lewis base. The intermediate of one of these substitution reactions, in which only the pyridine base of the phosphino&#8208;pyridine is bound to the diboron unit, displays frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. On the basis of the results, a new type of FLP chemistry is proposed, using for the first time dicationic diboranes as Lewis acidic component.







Abstract
The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two BII atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8722;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8722;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and phosphino&#8208;pyridines, establishing B&#8722;N and B&#8722;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8722;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8722;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, mono&#8208;dispersible, hydrophilic, and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic Cu&#8208;doped carbon dots (Cu&#8208;CDs) were prepared via one&#8208;pot hydrothermal carbonization. The harvested Cu&#8208;CDs permeated the cytomembrane and greatly promoted the catalytic oxidization of endogenous H2O2 into .OH and glutathione (GSH) depletion by oxidizing GSH into glutathione disulfide (GS&#8208;SG), resulting in the occurrence of oxidative stress and finally, death of bacteria.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5&#8197;&#956;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H2O2 and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Isoxazolines: Method and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoxazolines without the [3+2]: An electrochemical method for the synthesis of isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline through an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discount hypothesised involvement of closed&#8208;shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.







Abstract
An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline in an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally, in&#8208;situ reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesised involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.

         <title>Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient quadrupolar charge transfer in diaminoazobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide triads resulted in wide&#8208;band light capture. Charge&#8208;transfer emission was also possible to observe, and by fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry it was possible to revert this phenomenon. Ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer was confirmed by computational and femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in these triads.







Abstract
Strong push&#8208;pull interactions between electron donor, diaminoazobenzene (azo), and an electron acceptor, perylenediimide (PDI), entities in the newly synthesized A&#8722;D&#8722;A type triads (A=electron acceptor and D=electron donor) and the corresponding A&#8722;D dyads are shown to reveal wide&#8208;band absorption covering the entire visible spectrum. Electrochemical studies revealed the facile reduction of PDI and relatively easier oxidation of diaminoazobenzene in the dyads and triads. Charge transfer reversal using fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry wherein the PDI fluorescence recovery upon one&#8208;electron oxidation, deterring the charge&#8208;transfer interactions, was possible to accomplish. The charge transfer state density difference and the frontier orbitals from the DFT calculations established the electron&#8208;deficient PDI to be an electron acceptor and diaminoazobenzene to be an electron donor resulting in energetically closely positioned PDI&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; quadrupolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of triads and Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; dipolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of dyads. Subsequent femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies unequivocally proved the occurrence of excited&#8208;state charge transfer in these dyads and triads in benzonitrile wherein the calculated forward charge transfer rate constants, kf, were limited to instrument response factor, meaning &gt;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1 revealing the occurrence of ultrafast photo&#8208;events. The charge recombination rate constant, kr, was found to depend on the type of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates, that is, it was possible to establish faster kr in the case of triads (&#8764;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) compared to dyads (&#8764;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1). Modulating both ground and excited&#8208;state properties of PDI with the help of strong quadrupolar and dipolar charge transfer and witnessing ultrafast charge transfer events in the studied triads and dyads is borne out from the present study.

         <title>Nanosized Carbon Macrocycles Based on a Planar Chiral Pseudo Meta&#8208;[2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of planar chiral pseudo meta&#8208; [2.2]paracyclophane with cycloparaphenylenes backbone leads to necklace&#8208;shaped chiral macrocycles, which exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large |glum| and CPL brightness BCPL value originating from the planar chirality of [2.2]paracyclophane were observed.







Abstract
Structural designs combining cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) backbone with planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) lead to optical&#8208;active chiral macrocycles with intriguing properties. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis revealed aesthetic necklace&#8208;shaped structures and size&#8208;dependent packages with long&#8208;range channels. The macrocycles exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%, and the fluorescent color varies with ring size. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large CPL dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 and CPL brightness in the range of 30&#8211;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 were observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No noble metal needed: The cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification of aldehydes with alcohols under syngas conditions has been investigated and proved to be efficient for a broad range of coupling partners. The promoting effect of phosphine oxides allows for a milder and more general reaction: the methodology presented a good functional group tolerance and could be applied to natural alcohols.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;oxide&#8208;promoted, cobalt&#8208;catalysed reductive etherification using syngas as a reductant is reported. This novel methodology was successfully used to prepare a broad range of unsymmetrical ethers from various aldehydes and alcohols containing diverse functional groups, and was scaled&#8208;up to multigram scale under comparably mild conditions. Mechanistic experiments support an acetalization&#8211;hydrogenation sequence.

         <dc:description>Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn  4  O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Random Occupation of Multimetal Sites in Transition Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less order, more action: Compared to single metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the random occupation of multi&#8208;metal nodes in transitional MOFs builds a high&#8208;entropy state. Furthermore, this high&#8208;entropy&#8208;state MOFs caused a partial crystal distortion that can break up the catalytic atom&#8216;s saturated coordination environment to produce a highly active unsaturated state, optimizing the adsorption energies between oxygen intermediates and catalytic centres.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for the conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the synthesis of efficient high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalysts in a one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. This strategy allows control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimizing the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, better than a RuO2 catalyst tested under the same conditions. The finding of lattice distortion of the HEMOFs provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;exo cyclization/oxidation and silver&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been developed to synthesize 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and isoquinolinium salts, respectively. The two kinds of cyclization products could be transformed into isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes, isoquinolinones, 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one, oxazatricycle, and tetrahydroisoquinoline.







Abstract
Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines has been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines exclusively underwent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form N&#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;exo to 6&#8208;endo cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and a study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Reactions of the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne afforded structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been investigated.

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated reduction: The mechanism of glutathione (GHS)&#8208;mediated reduction of the activatable photosensitizer azoSeRho to the active drug SeRho has been computationally elucidated and requires four GSH molecules to take place. The SeRho formation is favoured in hypoxic environment. The exploration of the SeRho photophysical properties have allowed to highlight its intrinsic properties that make is suitable to trigger type II photoreactions in photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent activatable photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Variediene Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five DMAPP analogs with additional carbon atoms or with changed methylation patterns were converted with IPP and the bifunctional variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis AbVS to yield diterpene analogs with unusual skeletons. The DMAPP analogs opened new reaction pathways through the stabilisation of cationic charges at alternative carbon atoms that are naturally not observed.







Abstract
Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different trifluoromethylated phosphoranides are accessible upon treatment of trifluoromethylated phosphanes, such as P(CF3)3, with a source of F&#8722; or CF3&#8722; in presence of a stabilizing counterion. The hypervalent compounds have been investigated by NMR spectroscopic as well as X&#8208;ray crystallographic methods, gaining insights into their stability and structural behavior. In addition, the phosphoranides have revealed fluorinating and trifluoromethylating properties towards electrophiles.







Abstract
Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts are reported. [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4], [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F], and [NMe4][P(CF3)2F2] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF3&#8722; or F&#8722; units. These [P(CF3)4&#8208;nFn]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n=1&#8211;2) or trifluoromethylating (n=0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.

Herein, the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts are reported. [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F], and [NMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units. These [P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4-n&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (n=0&#8211;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n=1&#8211;2) or trifluoromethylating (n=0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid-state structures of [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and [K(18-crown-6)][P(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F] are ascertained by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinase Sensing Based on Protein Interactions at the Catalytic Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor, based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection, is described. The phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, was absorbed on gold electrodes to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependant enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10&#8197;nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentrations. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe  6  (  &#956;  3  &#8208;O)  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O  2  CH)  15  ] (  1  ) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA = N, N&#8217;&#8208; dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]  +  in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature T  N  of the complex is suppressed to 4.2 K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below T  N  , a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus,  1  is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified Mechanism for the PhCOCOOH&#8208;mediated Photochemical Reactions: Revisiting its Action and Comparison to Known Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since 2014, we have introduced in literature the use of phenylglyoxylic acid (PhCOCOOH), a small and commercially available organic molecule, as a potent promoter in a variety of photochemical processes. Although PhCOCOOH has a broad scope of photochemical reactions that can promote, the understanding of its mode of action in our early contributions was moderate. Herein, we are restudying and revisiting the mechanism of action of PhCOCOOH in most of these early contributions, providing a unified mechanism of action. Furthermore, the understanding of its action as a photoinitiator opened a new comparison study with known and commercially available photoinitiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Glyoxal&#8208;Linked Nucleotides and DNA for Bioconjugations and Crosslinking with Arginine&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein probes: Phenylglyoxal&#8208;linked dNTPs have been designed and synthesized by using two different approaches &#8211; CuAAC and Sonogashira reactions &#8211; that are compatible with the highly reactive glyoxal moiety. These nucleotides were shown to be good substrates for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes for crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.







Abstract
Glyoxal&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC click reaction of 4&#8208;azidophenylglyoxal or a Sonogashira reaction of 4&#8208;bromophenylglyoxal with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were used as substrates for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The glyoxal&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable imizadolone&#8208;linked conjugates. This reactive glyoxal modification in DNA was used for efficient bioconjugations and crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.&#8201;g., histones) and was found to be more reactive than previously reported 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked DNA probes.

The glyoxal-linked nucleotides reacted with arginine-containing peptides to form stable imizadolone-linked conjugates. This reactive glyoxal modification in DNA was used for efficient bioconjugations and crosslinking with Arg-containing peptides or proteins (e.&#8201;g., histones) and was found to be more reactive than previously reported 1,3-diketone-linked DNA probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8208; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic diazaoxa triangulene and [4]helicene cores were functionalized with alkynyl substituents to form effective dyes and fluorophores with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (&#916;&#955;abs up to 25&#8197;nm) and emissions (&#916;&#955;em up to 73&#8197;nm, &#934;PL up to 51&#8201;%). It is further shown that compounds made of achiral DAOTA skeletons present an original dynamic stereoisomerism with a barrier of &#8764;12&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the propyl rotation between planar chiral conformations (VT&#8197;NMR, DFT studies).







Abstract
Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8722; functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (&#916;&#955;abs up to 25&#8197;nm) and emissions (&#916;&#955;em up to 73&#8197;nm, &#934;PL up to 51&#8201;%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy (218&#8197;K), N&#8722;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (&#916;&#948;) as high as +1.64&#8197;ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273&#8197;K with a barrier of &#8764;12&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Ion pairing studies with &#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT anion not only confirm the occurrence of the chiral conformations but evidence a moderate but definite asymmetric induction from the chiral anion onto the cations. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on the geometries, the corresponding stereodynamics and also on the very large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.

         <title>Structure&#8208; and Interaction&#8208;Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying computational methods together with experimental procedures can speed up aptamer design. By using a new iterative design procedure, structure and interaction&#8208;based drug design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was designed and validated. The approach combines molecular dynamics with quantum chemistry to estimate binding affinity in silico with in&#8197;vitro verification.







Abstract
Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer in silico et vitro design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity by using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. By using a new iterative design procedure, structure&#8208; and interaction&#8208;based drug design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated. The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.

         <title>Strain&#8208;induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8211;n]pyrrole (n = 1~3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5 minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.</dc:description>

An unprecedented catalytic protocol for the asymmetric decarbonylative transformation: The cover art depicts how the asymmetric reaction of the Ir/S&#8722;Me&#8208;BIPAM complex takes precedence over the decarbonylation. The picture of the balance shows that the competing decarbonylation side reaction will not happen, as well as highlighting the asymmetry. More information can be found in the Research Article by T.

         <title>The recent progress of prelithiation reagents and strategies on high energy Lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life, while on the other hand, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this review is intended to discuss the considerations on the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in b&#8208;position can undergo stereospecific  syn  &#8208; or  anti  &#8208;elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the b&#8208;functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d  1  ) to an aldehyde or ketone (a  1  ) or diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of suitable boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii)&#160;diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d  1  *) to chiral boronates (a  1  *) with a leaving group in a&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Nitrogen Rich N&#8208;Heteropolycycles: Synthesis of Octaazaperopyrenes (OAPP)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ortho  substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron accepting behavior. Here, the synthesis as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the  peri  position of a  bay  chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted  bay  chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC  8  and characterized via EPR&#8208;spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A methodology for the C&#8208;H azidation of N &#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N &#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: Cycloaddition reactions or C&#8208;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase: A Multifaceted Biocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. The saturation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds by biocatalysts challenge the conventional chemical methodology as it bypasses the use of precious metals (in combination with chiral ligands and molecular hydrogen) or organocatalysts. In this line, Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) family are found to be a prominent asymmetric biocatalyst that is increasingly used in academia and industries towards unparalleled stereoselective  trans  &#8208;hydrogenations of activated C=C bonds. ERs gained prominence as they were used as individual catalysts, multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, and in conjugation with chemical reagents (chemoenzymatic approach). Besides, ERs&#8217; participation in the photoelectrochemical and radical&#8208;mediated process helps to unlock many scopes outside traditional biocatalysis. These up&#8208;and&#8208;coming methodologies entice the enzymologists and chemists to explore, expand and harness the chemistries displayed by ERs for industrial settings. Herein, we reviewed the last five year&#8217;s exploration of organic transformations using ERs.</dc:description>

         <title>An alternate [2&#215;2] grid constructed around TiO4N2 units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of a tetranuclear self&#8208;assembled species constructed around a TiO  4  N  2  motif is reported. This aggregate is generated from Ti(O  i  Pr)  4  , 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (bpym) and a bisbiphenol strand (L  2  H  4  ) where two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol units are connected with a biphenyl spacer. The solid&#8208;state structure of the [Ti  4  (L  2  )  4  (bpym)  4  ] architecture reveals the formation of an unprecedented chiral alternate [2&#215;2] grid. In addition to the structural characterization of the [Ti  4  (L  2  )  4  (bpym)  4  ] architecture, geometry optimisation on various possible isomeric tetrameric assemblies ([2&#215;2] grid, alternate [2x2] grid, circular helicate or cyclic hemihelicate) is performed using DFT calculations. These results confirm the higher stability of the alternate [2x2] grid over the other possible tetranuclear isomers and allow examining the replacement of the bpym ligands by two novel diimine chelates within the tetranuclear assembly (2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine = bipy and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazine = bipyraz). From this initial theoretical investigation, the competition between these three nitrogen ligands in the course of the selfassembly process is next evaluated. Overall, this investigation shows that the exclusive formation of the alternate [2x2] grid is driven by CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N interactions.</dc:description>

A new P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;Ph2P(=O)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)Ph2 abbreviated as (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4 (L4RR/SS), was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes, [M2((R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4)(hfa)6] (M=Y, Eu, Tb: M2L4RR/SS), which revealed significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) measurements.







Abstract
A P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4, was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with P&#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Y) with a P&#8208;chiral diphosphine dioxide, tpdpb(=O)2, were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the EuIII complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Band Gap Reduction in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>

Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction. Experimental Tauc plots indicate that TUB1 possesses indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. This results in a lower overall band gap, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu3(H5&#8208;MTPPA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2 NMP (H8&#8208;MTPPA=methane tetra&#8208;p&#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2&#8197;m2/g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium, the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide, the aluminium bis(hydrogensulfide), the six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide as well as a rare five&#8208;membered heterocyclic aluminium sulfide were synthesized controllably in mild manners. Reactions of the known dihydridoaluminium and the terphenyl dihydridoaluminium with various thiation reagents formed a series of aluminium&#8208;sulfur species. This provided insights into the influence of the supporting ligands on the reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions owing to limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (1) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium 1Tipp, 1 features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide 2, the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 4 and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 6 to be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8722;S&#8722;P five&#8208;membered ring (7) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Reconstructions Forced by Double Bow&#8208;Shaped Deformations and Second Coordination Sphere Effects of Cu(II) Heme Analogs in HER**

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of copper heme analogs has been modulated by geometric deformation. The work not only provides a new perspective on the function of natural heme distortion but also contributes a practical strategy to improve the catalytic performance of hemes through ligand geometric modulation.







Abstract
Both geometric architecture and electronic configurations of heme proteins contribute to its activity. In this work we designed and synthesized a series of four copper(II) porphyrin complexes (4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 2&#8208; and 1&#8208;Cu) where the molecular conformations are modulated by a pair of stepwise shortened straps on the same porphyrin side (cis&#8208;ortho) to give double bow&#8208;shaped skeletons. Single crystal structures demonstrate that the straps gradually increase the saddle deformation and the deviation of the metal centers, which is in accordance with two, unusual d&#8208;orbital reconstructions of two different ground states, as revealed by 4&#8197;K EPR and DFT calculations. In the study of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 1&#8208;Cu, with the shortest straps, showed the most apparent improvement of activity. Second coordination sphere (SCS) effects created by the double bow&#8208;shaped architecture and the strong saddle porphyrin core in 1&#8208;Cu are found to play key roles in proton trapping during the catalytic process. The work contributes a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of heme analogs through ligand geometric modulation.

         <title>Formation of Supramolecular Nanostructures through in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of a Biocatalytically Constructed Dipeptide Hydrazide**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ self&#8208;assembly of a biocatalytically constructed dipeptide hydrazide gives rise to supramolecular hydrogels consisting of networks of supramolecular nanoarchitectures under mild aqueous conditions. Moreover, post&#8208;assembly modification through hydrazone bond formation enables the decoration of the prefabricated supramolecular architectures. We believe that these findings could extend the molecular toolbox for programmable supramolecular nanostructures guided by protease&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly and subsequent post&#8208;assembly modification based on hydrazone formation.







Abstract
Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe how the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an N&#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the supramolecular architectures constructed in&#8197;situ tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized, Self&#8208;Assembling Small Interfering RNA&#8208;Prohead RNA Molecules Trigger Dicer&#8208;Independent Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules fusing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to prohead RNA (pRNA) three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) were designed. The siRNA&#8208;3WJs self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro. siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines triggered potent gene silencing. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ).







Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery in&#8197;vivo. An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway through Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer in&#8197;vitro. However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA&#8208;3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial proteases able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in the presence of surfactants remains essential for their structural characterization. Therefore, we report for the first time metal&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate complexes (M&#8208;K 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 where M = Zr(IV) or Hf(IV)) as catalysts for the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein, zein, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) via a competitive binding mechanism, which results in a dependence of the hydrolysis on the surfactant concentration.







Abstract
Despite the enormous importance of insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] (M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in ternary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering measurements.

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic confinement and precise spatial arrangement of catalysts in porous media can provide increased selectivity for reactions compared to homogeneous catalysis. Herein, a covalent organic framework for molecular heterogeneous olefin metathesis is presented that utilizes spatial confinement of substrates in its pores for a substrate&#8208;size dependent and increased macro(mono)cyclization selectivity.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocyclization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O=1.35) of up to 51&#8201;% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O=0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.

By adjusting reaction conditions, direct reduction of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (IF) gave radical anions (IF2&#8901;&#8722;Li+, IF&#8901;&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6), IF&#8901;&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF&#8901;&#8722;K+(cryptand)) and radical anionic dimer ([IF&#8901;&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2). IF2&#8901;&#8722;Li+, which is featuring a unique semiconductor. Compound IF&#8901;&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is a 1D magnetic chain; [IF&#8901;&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a radical anionic dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state; and IF&#8901;&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF&#8901;&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (IF) with various alkali metals prepare the radical anion salts. The data about different structures, properties, and characterization was obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements, and physical property measurement system (PPMS). Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is regarded as a one&#8208;dimensional magnetic chain through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C interaction. Theoretical calculations and magnetic results showed that [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state. Compounds IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts: IF2.&#8722;Li+ possesses unique &#960;&#8208;stack structure with an interplanar separation less than 3.46&#8197;&#197;, making it a semiconductor (&#948;RT=1.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1). This work gives insights into multifunctional radical anions, and describes the design and development of different functional radicals.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Stabilized Phosphenium Cations: Impact of the Substitution Pattern on the Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching selectivity: The isolation and coordination chemistry of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphenium cations is reported. The monoylidyl cations exhibit a distinctly higher reactivity and electrophilicity, thus yielding a chlorophosphine gold cation via chloride shift from gold to phosphorus. In contrast, the diylidyl cation formed the phosphenium AuCl complex, demonstrating the tunability of the phosphenium cation reactivity.







Abstract
Although N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Herein, the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]+ (with Y=Ph3PC(Ph), R=Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties are reported. Although the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide&#8208;abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y2P]+ formed the expected LAuCl]+ complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively, were synthesized inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate cavity, and Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the aerobic oxygenation of alkylarenes through a unique reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively. In particular, Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.

         <title>Structural and Functional Analysis of Bacterial Sulfonosphingolipids and Rosette&#8208;Inducing Factor 2 (RIF&#8208;2) by Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Guided Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Similarities across species: MS&#8208;guided isolation and the first total synthesis of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids allowed bioactivity studies on their rosette&#8208;inducing and inhibiting capabilities in Salpingoeca rosetta. The most abundant sulfonosphingolipids inhibited rosette inducing factor&#8208;related activity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner thus suggesting that sulfobacins are likely competing for the same cellular target in S. rosetta.







Abstract
We have analyzed the abundance of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids, including rosette&#8208;inducing factors (RIFs), in seven bacterial prey strains by using high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS2) and molecular networking (MN) within the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) web platform. Six sulfonosphingolipids resembling RIFs were isolated and their structures were elucidated based on comparative MS and NMR studies. Here, we also report the first total synthesis of two RIF&#8208;2 diastereomers and one congener in 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. For the total synthesis of RIF&#8208;2 congeners, we employed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize the necessary branched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids, and the Garner&#8208;aldehyde approach to generate the capnine base carrying three stereogenic centers. Bioactivity studies in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta revealed that the rosette inducing activity of RIFs is inhibited dose dependently by the co&#8208;occurring sulfonosphingolipid sulfobacins D and F and that activity of RIFs is specific for isolates obtained from Algoriphagus.

Definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity enable the regio&#8208;specific sulfonyl transfer reaction.







Abstract
Miniature models of acyl&#8208;transfer systems in cells, which were composed by replacing the protein, coenzyme, and substrate with CD, functional group, and CD, respectively, and combining them all together in one, displayed definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity, and thus enabled the regio&#8208;specific reaction.

         <title>Bimodal Fluorescence/Magnetic Resonance Molecular Probes with Extended Spin Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived nuclear singlet states have been shown to be a viable tool in many different areas of research, from material sciences over the investigation of catalytic cycles to applications in biochemistry. The synthesis of four compounds, in which a nuclear singlet state in pairs of 13C and 15N nuclei can be populated is shown. Furthermore, bimodal fluorescence/singlet&#8208;state NMR application for the determination of water concentration has been investigated, which can be useful in a variety of fields.







Abstract
Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science, as well as clinical research. The investigation of spin phenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing deeper insights into physiological processes. Herein, a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states is introduced. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. Symmetric, perdeuterated molecules, in which the singlet states can be populated by vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1&#8197;Hz) are reported. The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to four&#8197;minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, the existence of excited dimers, which are proposed to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states, is observed

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine is shown to induce and control the screw&#8208;sense preference of short Aib oligomers. Due to the electronic properties of the CF3 group, the screw&#8208;sense is inversed compared to that induced by its non&#8208;fluorinated isosteric l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;MeVal analogue. It also plays the role of 19F NMR reporter allowing the easy determination of both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and the assignment of its sign.







Abstract
Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 310 helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. The screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus. 1H and 19F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their N&#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 310&#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle 19F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.

         <title>Tuning Peptide Structure and Function through Fluorobenzene Stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free peptide stapling method based on SNAr reactions of fluorobenzene derivatives led to a library of constrained cyclic peptides with a controlled ortho, meta or para relationship between two cysteine residues. The method is compatible with solid&#8208;phase synthesis by which a single linear peptide can be cyclized with different degrees of constraint. New potent agonists of melanocortin receptors were synthesized by using this method, and the effect of the cyclization on the secondary structure was studied by NMR and CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed that enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with ortho, meta or para relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant differences in potency and efficacy demonstrate how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.

         <title>Developing the Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation Mechanism of Cyclopentane: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homemade MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products of cyclopentane, including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP), at a total pressure of 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and a low temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. The low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT was studied by experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by comparison with acyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and acycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy are not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. Low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (e.&#8201;g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of the oxidation of CPT &#8211; electronic structure calculations &#8211; were carried out at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p) level to explore the reactivity of O2 molecules adding sequentially to cyclopentyl radicals. Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2 is HO2 elimination yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2 addition &#8211; the dissociation of hydroperoxide &#8211; were further confirmed.

     alt="Developing the Low-Temperature Oxidation Mechanism of Cyclopentane: An Experimental and Theoretical Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A homemade MB-VUV-PI-TOFMS&lt;/b&gt; is used to observe the low-temperature oxidation products of cyclopentane, including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto-dihydroperoxide KDHP), at a total pressure of 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and a low temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. The low-temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT was studied by experimental and theoretical analyses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by comparison with acyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and acycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy are not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MB-VUV-PI-TOFMS) was applied to study the low-temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and low-temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. Low-temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (e.&#8201;g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto-dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of the oxidation of CPT &#8211; electronic structure calculations &#8211; were carried out at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31+ G(d,p) level to explore the reactivity of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules adding sequentially to cyclopentyl radicals. Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; addition &#8211; the dissociation of hydroperoxide &#8211; were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low-temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic and Crystallographic Characterization of the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Interaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Despite recent studies that have demonstrated the importance of R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds in synthesis, biology and medicine, these noncovalent interactions remain undercharacterized. Herein, we present crystallographic, computational and for the first time, spectroscopic evidence for these weak hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
As appreciation for nonclassical hydrogen bonds has progressively increased, so have efforts to characterize these interesting interactions. Whereas several kinds of C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds have been well&#8208;studied, much less is known about the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X variety. Herein, we present crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence for the existence of these interactions, with special relevance to Selectfluor chemistry. Of particular note is the propensity for Lewis bases to engage in nonclassical hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding with the electrophilic F atom of Selectfluor. Further, the first examples of 1H NMR experiments detailing R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=O, N) hydrogen bonds are described.

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Driven Overexpression in Chromobacterium vaccinii Facilitates Access to FR900359 and Yields Novel Low Abundance Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promoter&#8208;driven overexpression of the frs biosynthetic gene cluster, encoding the nonribosomal peptide assembly line for FR900359, in Chromobacterium vaccinii resulted in up to 8&#8208;fold increase in production compared to the wild type. Thereby, the challenging access to FR could be significantly enhanced and novel low abundance analogs of FR were made accessible for characterization of their structures and concerning their growth inhibition of uveal melanoma cell lines.







Abstract
Access to the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), a selective Gq/11 protein inhibitor of high pharmacological interest and a potential lead molecule for targeted therapy of cancers with oncogenic GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (encoding Gq and G11 respectively), has been challenging ever since its initial discovery more than three decades ago. The recent discovery of Chromobacterium vaccinii as a cultivable FR producer enables the development of approaches leading to a high&#8208;yielding, scalable and sustainable biotechnological process for production of FR, thereby removing this bottleneck. Here we characterize different promoters in exchange of the native promoter of the FR assembly line, resulting in an overexpression mutant with significantly increased production of FR. Thereby, the isolation and structure elucidation of novel FR analogs of low abundance is enabled. Further, we explore the antiproliferative activities of fifteen chromodepsins against uveal melanoma cell lines harboring Gq/11 mutations and characterize the major metabolite of FR formed in plasma.

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis provides access to different sized substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs). The use of a key synthon in a sequence of macrocyclization by cross&#8208;coupling with different reaction partners followed by aromatization allows a modular build&#8208;up. The controlled introduction of substituents enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement of these molecular carbon allotropes in the solid state.







Abstract
Herein, we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different sizes. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared by [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization through single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straightforward manner. The tBu ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van der Waals interactions that exhibits one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube direction, thus opening new avenues in the crystal design of CPPs.

         <title>Novel Lipophilic Fluorophores with Highly Acidity&#8208;Dependent Two&#8208;Photon Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon photophysical characterization of four novel lipophilic pH probes based on phosphazene modified coumarin&#8208;151. These probes are shown to have spectral features robust to variation of local polarity from different solvents, yet display easily separable neutral and protonated forms, with maximum 2PA brightness of, &#963;2PA&#8901;&#981;em=10&#8211;13&#8197;GM. Nonlinear optical properties are quantitatively determined experimentally and compared to computational models.







Abstract
Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine the high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Herein we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region &#955;2PA=550&#8211;1000&#8197;nm, observing 2PA cross sections of &#963;2PA=10&#8211;20&#8197;GM, with an associated 2PEF brightness of 10&#8211;13&#8197;GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and n&#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.

         <dc:description>
This article overviews the advanced structures and sensing properties of representative AIE&#8208;active supramolecular assemblies and illustrates the detection mechanism of the established sensing systems for monitoring particular analytes including metal ions, anions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and heparin drugs. The advantages, accessibility, and challenges of these systems based on commonly used AIE fluorophores are also discussed. For more information, see the Minireview by Y.&#8208;W. Yang et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;22 ff.

         <title>Frontispiece: Regulation of Electrocatalytic Activity by Local Microstructure: Focusing on the Catalytic Active Zone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local microstructure active zone emphasizes the high catalytic activity zone formed by the interaction of active atoms with neighboring atoms and the surrounding environment, which no longer regards a single, stable atom as the active site. Under the guidance of this concept, atomic&#8208;scale blending catalysts obtained by sol&#8208;gel methods can achieve high performance in electrocatalytic reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction. These reaction processes are investigated by in&#8197;situ characterization technologies, laying a foundation for industrialization of high performance electrocatalysts. Read more in the Review from Zhang et&#8197;al. on page 5&#8211;1.

Highly oxygenated intermediates play an important role in the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of fuels. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products, especially highly oxygenated intermediates like ketohydroperoxide (KHP), keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide (KDHP), olefinic hydroperoxides (OHP) and dione structure products. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Chen, J. Chen, Z. Tang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103546).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a self&#8208;assembling dipeptide hydrazide from two kinds of non&#8208;self&#8208;assembling amino acid derivatives gives rise to the formation of supramolecular helical architectures under aqueous conditions. In addition, post&#8208;assembly modification based on hydrazone formation allows the in&#8208;situ constructed supramolecular helical architectures to be decorated with tethering hydrazide groups as chemical handles. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Ikeda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104421).

         <dc:description>
The key building block of our flexible approach to the modular synthesis of substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) is in the spotlight. From this stage, the depicted substituted [8]&#8208; and [10]CPPs were synthesised in two more steps, macrocyclization and reductive aromatization. The optoelectronic properties of these nanorings were compared to those of the parent CPPs, as well as the tube&#8208;like solid state structure.

         <title>Supramolecular Assemblies with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent supramolecular assembly systems with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties for the detection of analytes including metal ions, anions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and heparin are summarized according to their unique architectures, diverse functions, outstanding sensitivity, and excellent selectivity as sensing platforms. Furthermore, the additional advantages of the marriage between supramolecular assemblies and AIE features are highlighted, and opportunities, challenges, and development perspectives of the particular combination are also discussed.







Abstract
The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.

         <title>Regulation of Electrocatalytic Activity by Local Microstructure: Focusing on the Catalytic Active Zone</title>

Tailored catalysts: Traditional design methods of catalytic active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in catalytic activity. The concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and helps develop new methodologies to control the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions. This review provides the research progress of this strategy in electrocatalytic reactions, with the emphasis on their important applications in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR).







Abstract
Traditional regulation methods of active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in the catalytic activity. Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new methods to regulate the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial for understanding the relationship between material, structure, and catalysis, which realizes the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy for electrocatalytic reactions, with emphasis on their applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction.

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation of Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be and Mg (Route&#8208;I), to Pb (Route&#8208;II), Zn, Cd (Route&#8208;III) in a flexible fluorooxoborate framework hierarchically enhances the optical anisotropy up to 46.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth, d10 electron configuration, and 6s2 lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework from AEB4O6F2 (AE=Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6&#8201;% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (route&#8208;I), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB4O6F2 structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146&#8197;nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm, and the PbB4O6F2 structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194&#8197;nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 8, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial hyperpolarization of nuclear spins in alkene products was observed in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen mediated by a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst. The observed effects are unusual, as the mechanism of the reaction is not pairwise, thus allowing hyperpolarization of only one of two protons at double bonds. Moreover, this enabled various important intermediates to be characterized by hyperpolarized 1H, 11B and 15N NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H2 transfer to alkynes that normally prevents parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) from being observed. Nevertheless, the specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled the detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H2 intermediates through substantial 1H, 11B and 15N signal enhancement and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Conjugated Spinach RNA by Genetic Alphabet Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8722;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression  in vitro  and  in vivo  . We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light-emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8722;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression  in vitro  and  in vivo  . We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye-conjugated unnatural base substrate is site-specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye-conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)Optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of chiral distorted acenes ([n]CPPAn2,6; n=6&#8211;8). Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity were achieved only when the size is small. These enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum|&#8764;0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6).







Abstract
Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to a low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein, we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n=6&#8211;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain=60.8 to 73.4&#8197;kcal/mol) and very small Egap (&#8764;3.0&#8197;eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum|&#8764;0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.

         <title>Binding Interactions in Copper, Silver and Gold &#960;&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding between coinage metal complexes and alkenes or alkynes is affected in a non&#8208;intuitive way by electron withdrawing substituents at the ancillary ligands. Investigation in solution, solid&#8208;state, and gas&#8208;phase gives an insight into the nature of these interactions. Metal&#8208;alkene/alkyne binding energies increase in the order Ag&lt;Cu&lt;Au and they are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. The &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction is particularly dominant in the gold complexes. Accordingly, the electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the ancillary ligands weaken the gold&#8208;alkene/alkyne bonding.







Abstract
The copper(I), silver(I), and gold(I) metals bind &#960;&#8208;ligands by &#963;&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;back bonding interactions. These interactions were investigated using bidentate ancillary ligands with electron donating and withdrawing substituents. The &#960;&#8208;ligands span from ethylene to larger terminal and internal alkenes and alkynes. Results of X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR, and IR spectroscopy and gas phase experiments show that the binding energies increase in the order Ag&lt;Cu&lt;Au and the binding energies are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. Modulation of the electron density at the metal using substituents on the ancillary ligands shows that the &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction plays a dominant role for the binding in the copper and gold complexes.

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Dimerization and Self&#8208;Assembly of Artificial, Ribose&#8208;Based Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of artificial ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles have been prepared and self&#8208;assembled into various supramolecular structures, exhibiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The molecularly dissolved amphiphiles can be converted selectively into dimeric pyrophosphates in the presence of carbodiimide EDC, giving rise to helical fibers with lengths at the micrometer scale.







Abstract
The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe the first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a  meta  photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible&#8208;light in a two&#8208;step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain&#8208;release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light&#8208;driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation Based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry, and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8211;guest complexes with a series of push&#8211;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8211;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tunable  1  O  2  generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy of the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization Essential Medicine, is reported. This study enabled the observation, isolation and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the transformation of benzil (1), urea (2), and KOH into phenytoin (3). The depth of this investigation answers scientifically interesting questions, which might be helpful for the propulsion of mechanosynthetic protocols among mainstream methodologies for synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8197;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.

         <title>MOF Encapsulated AuPt Bimetallic Nanoparticles for Improved Plasmonic&#8208;induced Photothermal Catalysis of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new catalytic strategies for achieving efficient CO  2  hydrogenation under mild conditions is of great significance for environmental remediation. Herein, a composite photocatalyst Zr&#8208;based MOF encapsulated plasmonic AuPt alloy nanoparticles (AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  ) was successfully constructed for the efficient photothermal catalysis of CO  2  hydrogenation. Under light irradiation at 150&#176;C, AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  achieved a CO production rate of 1451 &#956;mol g  metal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  with 91% selectivity, which far exceeded those obtained by Au@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  with Pt shell on Au (599 &#956;mol g  metal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and Au@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  (218 &#956;mol g  metal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ). The outstanding performances of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  were attributed to the synergetic effect originating from the plasmonic metal Au NPs, doped active metal Pt, and encapsulation structure of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  shell. This work provides a new way for photothermal catalysis of CO  2  and a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;Type Acidic Ring&#8208;Opening of Triptycenes: A New Synthetic Approach to Acenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened in a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as with TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.

         <title>Unlocking the Hydrolytic Mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;Mannosidases: Computation Inspires the use of C&#8208;Glycosides as Michaelis Complex Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycoside hydrolase 92 enzymes catalyze the degradation of N&#8208;glycans containing chains of &#945;&#8208;mannose. Since experiments with S&#8208;glycosides did not shed light about the conformation of the Michaelis complex (MC), we present a multidisciplinary work where computation and experiments demonstrate the reactive conformation adopted by the sugar in the MC. In addition, we demonstrate the power of C&#8208;glycosides as MC mimics.







Abstract
The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2&#8594;B2,5&#8594;1S5 and 3S1&#8594;3H4&#8594;1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1&#8594;4H5/1S5&#8594;1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH's natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5&#8594;B2,5/1S5&#8594;1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.

&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Degradable Protein&#8208;Polymer Hybrid Shells for Caging Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards the remote control of cell functions is reported. Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for protecting the whole cell surface were developed by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of polymers and polymer micelles through protein&#8208;ligand binding. These shells can be used to photo&#8208;regulate cellular functions by steric hinderance against the interaction between cell surfaces and substrates.







Abstract
There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering is reported. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry: [Cp*Rh] complexes supported by chelating diphosphine ligands can support generation of isolable metal monohydrides, but prior work has shown that the reduction potentials required to promote cleavage of Rh&#8722;H moieties in these complexes are quite negative. Herein, ligand&#8208;centered oxidation of a [Cp*Rh] monohydride is demonstrated to result in dramatic acidification of a Rh&#8722;H by 23 pKa units. Ligand&#8208;promoted redox chemistry could thus be a useful tool for promoting reactivity in metal&#8211;hydride systems.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Herein, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e&#8722;. Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible RhII/I process at &#8722;0.96&#8197;V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon RhII species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]+, that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]+, and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8722;H moiety by 23 pKa units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by in situ 1H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8722;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.

         <title>Boron&#8208;, Sulfur&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Multiple Resonance Emitters for Narrow&#8208;Band Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emitters are designed and synthesized to combine high photoluminescent quantum efficiency and rapid reverse intersystem crossing in one multiple resonance system for efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emission with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for PAH skeletons with multiple resonance effect and narrow&#8208;band emission.







Abstract
Two boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (88&#8201;%) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC= 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) are designed and synthesized, enabling efficient narrow&#8208;band blue electroluminescence at 473&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for multiple resonance emitters and an approach to regulate their emission properties.

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation Enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic self&#8208;assembled coordination cage was decorated with cholesterol groups attached via ethoxy chains, giving it a pronounced amphiphilic character. The nanosized cage acts as a surfactant for a variety of nonaqueous emulsions. These were employed in mini&#8208;emulsion polymerization reactions to produce polyurethane and polyurea materials with different particle sizes and morphologies.







Abstract
Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile's polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.

A hybrid semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell mimicking the PSII is proposed for efficient water oxidation. Addition of carbazole mediator results in a significant enhancement in PEC water oxidation performance as it promotes interfacial hole transfer from the Fe2O3 light absorber to the Ru(carbene) catalyst, a function similar to the tyrosine residue in photosystem II. Such a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst assembly greatly inspires the rational design of high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis systems.







Abstract
In fabricating an artificial photosynthesis (AP) electrode for water oxidation, we have devised a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst structure that mimics photosystem II (PSII). It is based on a surface layer of vertically grown nanorods of Fe2O3 on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes with a carbazole mediator base and a Ru(II) carbene complex on a nanolayer of TiO2 as a water oxidation co&#8208;catalyst. The resulting hybrid assembly, FTO|Fe2O3|&#8722;carbazole|TiO2|&#8722;Ru(carbene), demonstrates an enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance compared to an electrode without the added carbaozle base with an increase in photocurrent density of 2.2&#8208;fold at 0.95&#8197;V vs. NHE and a negatively shifted onset potential of 500&#8197;mV. The enhanced PEC performance is attributable to carbazole mediator accelerated interfacial hole transfer from Fe2O3 to the Ru(II) carbene co&#8208;catalyst, with an improved effective surface area for the water oxidation reaction and reduced charge transfer resistance.

         <dc:description>We report a visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides.

Utilization of CF  3  SO  2  Na or CF  2  HSO  2  Na as coupling partners further achieves three&#8208;component fluoromethyl&#8208;arylation of vinyl ethers, furnishing a series of valuable CF  3  /CF  2  H&#8208;incorporated alkyl heterocycles under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) Complexes for the Ring Opening Copolymerization of Carbon Dioxide/Epoxide and Anhydride/Epoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalysed ring opening copolymerization&#160;(ROCOP) of carbon dioxide or anhydrides with&#160;epoxides are controlled polymerizations that access useful polycarbonates and polyesters. Here, a series of heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) complexes&#160; reveal the most effective&#160;metal combinations. They combine first row transition metals (Cr(II) to Zn(II)), with Mg(II); all complexes are coordinated by the same macrocyclic ancillary ligand and two acetates. The complex syntheses, characterization and&#160;polymerization data, for both carbon dioxide/cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and endo&#8208;norbornene anhydride (NA)/cyclohexene oxide, are reported. The fastest catalyst for both polymerizations is Mg(II)Co(II) showing&#160;propagation rate constants (  k  p  ) of 34.7 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  &#160;(CO  2  ) and 75.3 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  &#160;(NA) (100 &#176;C). The Mg(II)Fe(II) catalyst shows&#160;equivalently high&#160;rates for CO  2  /CHO ROCOP (  k  p  &#160;= 34.7 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  ) and may have preferable metallic abundance, cost and low toxicity. Polymerization kinetics analyses show that the two lead catalysts have&#160;second order rate laws, with zeroth order dependencies in CO  2  &#160;or anhydride and first order&#160; in both catalyst and epoxide concentrations. Compared to the&#160; Mg(II)Mg(II) complex, nearly all the transition metal heterodinuclear complexes show synergic rate enhancements whilst maintaining high selectivity and polymerization control. These findings are relevant to the future design and optimization of copolymerization catalysts and should stimulate broader investigations of synergic heterodinuclear main group/transition metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Parasitic light absorption, rate laws and heterojunctions in the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III) using composite TiO2/Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Composite photocatalyst&#8208;adsorbents such as TiO2/Fe2O3  are promising materials for the one&#8208;step treatment of arsenite contaminated water. However, no previous study has investigated how coupling TiO2  with Fe2O3  influences the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III). Herein, we develop new hybrid experiment/modelling approaches to study light absorption, charge carrier behaviour and changes in the rate law of the TiO2/Fe2O3  system, using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and kinetic analysis.  Whilst coupling TiO2  with Fe2O3  improves total arsenic removal by adsorption, oxidation rates significantly decrease (up to a factor of 60), primarily due to the parasitic absorption of light by Fe2O3  (88% of photons at 368 nm) and secondly due to changes in the rate law from disguised zero&#8208;order kinetics to first&#8208;order kinetics. Charge transfer across this TiO2&#8208;Fe2O3  heterojunction is not observed.  Our study demonstrates the first application of a multi&#8208;adsorbate surface complexation model (SCM)  towards describing As(III) oxidation kinetics which, unlike Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood kinetics, includes the competitive adsorption of As(V), and we further highlight the importance of parasitic light absorption and catalyst fouling when designing heterogeneous photocatalysts for As(III) remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamically Favourable States in the Reaction of Nitrogenase without Dissociation of any Sulfide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mechanism of nitrogenase from N2H2 to 2&#8201;NH3 without any dissociated sulfide ligands has been studied by QM/MM methods. The calculations suggest an alternating mechanism in which the substrate binds to Fe6. Homocitrate functions as a proton buffer, stabilising H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. The two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. His&#8208;195 prefers protonation on the NE2 atom and proton transfer from this residue is favourable for all steps.







Abstract
We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociates. To avoid the problem that there is no consensus regarding the structure and protonation of the E4 state, we start from a state where N2 is bound to the cluster and is protonated to N2H2, after dissociation of H2. We show that the reaction follows an alternating mechanism with HNNH (possibly protonated to HNNH2) and H2NNH2 as intermediates and the two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. For all intermediates, coordination to Fe6 is preferred, but for the E4 and E8 intermediates, binding to Fe2 is competitive. For the E4, E5 and E7 intermediates we find that the substrate may abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the homocitrate ligand of the FeMo cluster, thereby forming HNNH2, H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase. All steps in the suggested reaction mechanism are thermodynamically favourable compared to protonation of the nearby His&#8208;195 group and in all cases, protonation of the NE2 atom of the latter group is preferred.

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method is established for to characterize the degree of cooperativity and K0.5 of a cooperative metal&#8208;enzyme binding interaction using microfluidics and imaging self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (iSAMDI). Numerical calculations were used to build a finite element model to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of reaction yields for each channel within the microfluidic device.







Abstract
This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120&#8197;&#956;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200&#8197;&#956;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.

         <title>Redox Replacement of Silver on MOF&#8208;Derived Cu/C Nanoparticles on Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From CO2 to C2+: A novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been synthesized by electroless redox replacement directly on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similar&#8208;sized nanoparticles showed the highest conversion of CO2 to C2+ products compared to only Cu&#8208;modified gas diffusion electrodes. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography measurements suggest two parallel CO2 reduction mechanisms to produce HCO2H and C2+ products on the bimetallic Cu/Ag surface.







Abstract
Bimetallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to locally increase the CO flux during electrochemical CO2 reduction, so as to maximize the rate of conversion to C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been prepared by a redox replacement process, in which the ratio of the two metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO2 conversion to C2+ products compared to non&#8208;Ag&#8208;modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and in&#8208;situ Raman measurements in a CO2 gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top&#8208;bound linear adsorbed *CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps, as evidenced by the increasing&#957;C&#8722;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms operate simultaneously towards the production of HCO2H and C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully regioselective synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines through a cascade reaction from bench&#8208;stable non&#8208;aromatic precursors is reported. The convenient reaction setup requires only heating of the desired amine and the bench&#8208;stable reagents in sulfolane. The method is compatible with a broad range of primary, secondary and aromatic amines and proceeds in 20&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (20&#8211;81&#8201;%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Four Dibenzofuran&#8208;Terminated High&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Energy Hole Transporters for High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Life Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
Four dibenzofuran&#8208;terminated hole&#8208;transporters exhibit superior thermal and electrical stability, thus realizing highly efficient and long lifetime thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). A TADF OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23&#8201;% and operation lifetime (LT50) of over 20&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Moreover, a phosphorescent OLED achieves an EQE of 21&#8201;% and LT50 of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching the anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit i)&#8197;high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward the anion state, ii)&#8197;a high glass transition temperature (Tg&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), and iii)&#8197;high triplet energy (ET&gt;2.7&#8197;eV), thereby enabling approximately 20&#8201;% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50&#8201;% (LT50) of 20&#8201;000&#8211;30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential (IP), BDE, and Tg are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208;transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.

         <title>Cyclopentannulated Dihydrotetraazapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkyne units of bissilylethynylated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacene are transferred into a dihydrotetraazapentacene core by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction to form a new type of cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacene. Depending on the applied catalyst systems, either silyl group retention or migration takes place, which gives rise to constitutional isomers that show comparable optoelectronic properties but completely different packing motifs in the solid states.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of bissilylethynylated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacene (TIPS&#8208;TAP&#8208;H2) into bissilylated cyclopenta[fg,qr]pentacenes is reported. Depending on the catalyst either none, one or two silyl groups migrate and change their positions in the formed five&#8208;membered rings. The optoelectronic properties are quite similar, whereas the packing motifs differ dramatically. Control experiments and quantum chemical calculations were performed to investigate the mechanism of the reaction and the selectivity of the silyl shift.

         <title>A Mechanism for Nitrogenase Including Loss of a Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lost property: The possible loss of a sulfide mechanism for the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase has been investigated by hybrid DFT using a cluster model. The calculations show that, after four reductions, a sulfide can be released as a H2S group. After another four reductions, the central carbon is protonated with one proton in E4, from where the loss of H2 and binding of N2 is reversible.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the only enzyme in nature that can fix N2 from the air. The active cofactor of the leading form of this enzyme contains seven irons and one molybdenum connected by sulfide bridges. In several recent experimental studies, it has been suggested that the cofactor is very flexible, and might lose one of its sulfides during catalysis. In this study, the possible loss of a sulfide has been investigated by model calculations. In previous studies, we have shown that there should be four activation steps before catalysis starts, and this study is based on that finding. It was found here that, after the four reductions in the activation steps, a sulfide will become very loosely bound and can be released in a quite exergonic step with a low barrier. The binding of N2 has no part in that release. In our previous studies, we suggested that the central carbide should be protonated three times after the four activation steps. With the new finding, there will instead be a loss of a sulfide, as the barrier for the loss is much lower than the ones for protonating the carbide. Still, it is suggested here that the carbide will be protonated anyway, but only with one proton, in the E3 to E4 step. A very complicated transition state for H2 formation involving a large structural change was obtained. The combined step, with a loss of H2 and binding of N2, is calculated to be endergonic by +2.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1; this is in excellent agreement with experiments in which an easily reversible step has been found.

         <title>Inverse&#8208;Tunable Red Luminescence and Electronic Properties of Nitridoberylloaluminates Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridoberylloaluminate Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;2) were synthesized in a HIP under 50&#8197;MPa N2 atmosphere at 1200&#8211;1400&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast to the usual trend, the emission maximum in the prepared samples is inversely shifted to higher wavelengths by the incorporation of the larger cation Ba2+.







Abstract
The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba2[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ and solid solutions Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50&#8197;MPa N2 atmosphere at 1200&#8201;&#176;C. Ba2[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ crystallizes in triclinic space group 
 (no. 2) (Z=2, a=6.1869(10), b=7.1736(13), c=8.0391(14)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=102.754(8), &#946;=112.032(6), &#947;=104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr&#8201;:&#8201;Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of M2[BeAl3N5] (M=Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450&#8197;nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656&#8197;nm (fwhm=1922&#8211;2025&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (72&#8211;87&#8197;nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr2+ by larger Ba2+ leads to an inverse&#8208;tunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low&#8208;temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.

         <title>A New Variant of Emissive RNA Alphabets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate scope of T7 RNA Polymerase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are expanded by the introduction of a new ribonucleoside alphabet based on a methylthieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine core. The majority of the new analogues display significantly red shifted emission relative to the corresponding thieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine and isothiazolo[4,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine based analogues.







Abstract
A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (mthN) consisting of pyrimidine and purine analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described. Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine (thN) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine (tzN) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding mthN/mthNTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the mthN alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.

         <title>Simultaneous Organic and Inorganic Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry within Pillararene&#8208;Protein Cage Frameworks</title>

Very accepting: (Apo)ferritin protein cages self&#8208;assemble with cationic pillararenes into porous crystalline framework structures. The apoferritin and pillararene in the crystals can simultaneously host inorganic and organic pollutants, where the binding is determined by the host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules provides a powerful bottom&#8208;up strategy to build functional nanostructures and materials. Among the different biomacromolecules, protein cages offer various advantages including uniform size, versatility, multi&#8208;modularity, and high stability. Additionally, protein cage crystals present confined microenvironments with well&#8208;defined dimensions. On the other hand, molecular hosts, such as cyclophanes, possess a defined cavity size and selective recognition of guest molecules. However, the successful combination of macrocycles and protein cages to achieve functional co&#8208;crystals has remained limited. In this study, we demonstrate electrostatic binding between cationic pillar[5]arenes and (apo)ferritin cages that results in porous and crystalline frameworks. The electrostatically assembled crystals present a face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and cryo&#8208;TEM. These hierarchical structures result in a multiadsorbent framework capable of hosting both organic and inorganic pollutants, such as dyes and toxic metals, with potential application in water&#8208;remediation technologies.

         <title>A Solid Support&#8208;Based Synthetic Strategy for the Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Peptides with Organometallic Half&#8208;Sandwich Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with metal moieties has been achieved with a carbene ligand on solid support which facilitated the isolation and purification of metal&#8208;peptide conjugates. The developed methodology allows the metalation of Lys side chain functional groups and the N&#8208;terminus in presence of competing metal&#8208;binding amino acids.







Abstract
The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8208;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium pro&#8208;ligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Methylation and Alkylation Reactions by Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H Functionalization: Computational studies on the reaction of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes were used for pre&#8208;evaluation of metal catalysts and diazoalkanes, and suggest rhodium catalysts to be well&#8208;suited for such C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. These findings allowed the rapid identification of suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8722;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkanes. Applications in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol allow efficient methylation reactions with TMS diazomethane through a C&#8722;H functionalization/desilylation reaction cascade.







Abstract
In this combined computational and experimental study, the C&#8722;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes was investigated. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8722;H functionalization reaction. With these findings, suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8722;H methylation reactions were quickly identified by using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8722;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>

Electronic effects in the boron&#8208;chalcogen multiple bonds through ligand variation of a series of new chalcogenboranes stabilized by N,N&#8217;&#8208;chelating amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligands were studied by DFT approach. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and electron delocalization yield the shortest B=X bond lengths and the highest B=X bond orders.







Abstract
The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (Frank et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X=O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a &#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations into the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and Automated Fitting Procedure for Angular Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Ligand Field Theory, the angular overlap model (AOM) can in principle describe the electron donor/acceptor capabilities of individual ligands. However, its applicability is limited by the nature of the spectroscopic data. We present a computational approach for automated AOM parameter fitting and investigate metal&#8211;halide bonds that had previously been described only heuristically. This approach is applied to a 2D spectrochemical series, for which a linear relationship between AOM parameters and the chemical hardness of the ligands is found.







Abstract
The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with ab initio LFT a direct connection to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme of the ligand field splitting that has, however, been restricted by the availability and resolution of experimental data. Using ab initio LFT, we present here a generalised, symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions commonly made in AOM applications, for example, transferability or the relative magnitudes of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral halido metalates ([MIIX4]2&#8722;, M=Mn&#8722;Cu) served as a case study. A previously unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve our understanding of ligand&#8211;metal interactions in coordination complexes.

Using &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; LFT, we present here a generalised, symmetry-independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions commonly made in AOM applications, for example, transferability or the relative magnitudes of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural or electronic changes. A two-dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral halido metalates ([M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, M=Mn&#8722;Cu) served as a case study. A previously unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve our understanding of ligand&#8211;metal interactions in coordination complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benchmarking of density functionals for the description of optical properties of newly synthesized &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF blue emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer via &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They are able to predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning of the C/N ratio of C&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) materials by the melamine/carboxylic acid adduct route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CC&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of composition have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acid (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4  for comparison). The properties of these materials were followed by different techniques (XRD, Raman, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase of the C content is associated to a disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and to an increase of the subnanometric carbon&#8211;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4  structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase of the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of the N=C&#8208;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability in inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Addition of Grignard Reagents to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Bulky turbo&#8208;Organomagnesium Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard reagents (R&#8208;Mg&#8208;X) are commercial carbon nucleophiles commonly used in organic synthesis, but their stability becomes a limitation for the least&#8208;reactive electrophiles. A bulky magnesium anilide additive (in purple) generates a new organometallic reagent (R&#8722;Mg&#8208;NHAr) in&#8197;situ that boosts the nucleophilicity and selectivity of the organometallic ligand (in green). In the Research Article by A. Mendoza and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104053), these reagents prove to be instrumental in the direct synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acids, a transformation that was only possible with some organolithium reagents before.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and electrochemical data for [Cp*Rh] complexes spanning three oxidation states demonstrate that the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene ligand, a notable but uncommon analogue of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization. This &#8220;fresh light&#8221; on the bonding properties is reflected in the photo of a recent vibrant sunset in the authors&#8217; home city of Lawrence, Kansas.

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strictosidine is an important molecule in the biosynthesis of higher plants that gives rise to a great variety of structures. A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. In this image, the strictosidine aglycon is depicted as a gavel that produces treasure in Japanese folktales to represent the production of various natural products from a single molecule. The natural products produced in this study will be very useful as a library for drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Sakamoto and H. Ishikawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104052).

         <title>Properties of Bromine Fused Salts based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine's vapor pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates show potent complement&#8208;dependent cell killing by recruiting natural antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two Eu  III  ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear Eu  III  complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear Eu  III  complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. The tribo&#8208;chemical reaction is based on a characteristic energy transfer pathway for the selective formation of an excited triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 26 kcal mol&#8208;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208;and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.</dc:description>

         <title>An Incremental System To Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in All&#8208;meta&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An incremental system for London dispersion has been developed that allows an easy back&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;envelope estimation when systematically altering the London dispersion donors. A simple equation is proposed that nicely reproduces the experimental results within error.







Abstract
Predictive models based on incremental systems exist for many chemical phenomena, thus allowing easy estimates. Despite their low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interactions are ubiquitous in manifold situations ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system, we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of the alkyl substituents Me, Et, iPr up to tBu. Based on this data, we were able to implement an incremental system for London dispersion for the azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation that allows the prediction of the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in azobenzenes, which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Lithium Ion by Artificial Protective Overlayers for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on lithium metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve nonuniform lithium ion flux and sluggish lithium ion transportation at the anode surface. This Concept article introduces the key advancement of artificial protective overlayers for high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
The main limitation of lithium (Li) metal anodes lies in their severe dendrite growth due to nonuniform Li+ flux and sluggish Li+ transportation at the anode surface. Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on Li metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve this problem. In this Concept article, we focus on the basic principles of regulating interfacial Li+ through artificial protective overlayers and summarize the material preparation as well as structural design of these overlayers. The remaining challenges and promising directions of artificial protective overlayers are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of Li metal anodes.

         <title>In&#8208;situ synthesis of the thinnest In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 sandwich&#8208;like heterojunction for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional sandwich&#8208;like heterojunction of In 2  Se 3  /In 2  S 3  /In 2  Se 3  (SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  ) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  heterojunction. The in&#8208;situ synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet arrays by using surface substitution of Se atom to epitaxially grow cell In 2  Se 3  maximizes the contact area of heterogeneous interface and accelerates the transmission of charge carrier. Benefitting from the unique structure and composition characteristic, SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  displays excellent performance in PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  reaches 8.43 mA cm &#8722;2  at 1.23 V RHE  . Compared with In 2  S 3  , the SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  photoanode has nearly 12 times higher PEC performance, which represents the best performance among the In 2  S 3  &#8208;based photoanode heterojunction reported so far. The evolution rate of O 2  reaches 78.8 &#956;mol cm &#8208;2  h &#8208;1  , and the photocurrent has no apparent variety within 24 hours.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven interfacial vaporization by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion to the air&#8208;water interface has attracted tremendous attention. In the process of converting solar energy into heat energy, photothermal materials play an essential role.&#160;Herein, a flexible solar&#8208;thermal material di&#8208;cyan substituted 5,12&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DCN&#8208;4CQA)@Paper was developed via coating photothermal quinacridone derivatives on the cellulose paper. The DCN&#8208;4CQA@Paper combines&#160;desired chemical and physical properties, broadband light&#8208;absorbing,&#160;and shape&#8208;conforming abilities that render efficient photothermic vaporization. Notably, synergetic coupling of solar&#8208;steam and solar&#8208;electricity technologies via integrating DCN&#8208;4CQA@Paper and the thermoelectric&#160;devices&#160;is realized without trade&#8208;offs, highlighting the practical consideration toward more impactful solar heat exploitation. Such solar distillation and low&#8208;grade heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity generation functions can provide potential opportunities for fresh water and electricity supply in off&#8208;grid or remote areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly selective lysine acylation in proteins using a Lys&#8208;His tag sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His 6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N &#945; &#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Here, we report the peptide sequences His n &#8208;Lys&#8208;His m , which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N &#949; &#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light switching of metallosupramolecular assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the  E  &#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd  3  L  6  ]  6+  and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd  4  L  8  ]  8+  (1:2 ratio at 298 K). Irradiation with 410&#160;nm light generates a photostationary state with ~80% of the  E&#8208;  isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2 days at 333 K. The  Z  &#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25 days at 298K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Decisive Role of Spin&#8208;States and Spin&#8208;Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordinatively unsaturated Chromium (II)&#8208;based Cr  3  [(Cr  4  Cl)  3  (BTT)  8  ]  2  (Cr&#8208;BTT; BTT  3&#8208;  =1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O  2  over N  2  /H  2  . Using periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we attempt to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas bound MOFs [(Cr  4  (X)  4  Cl)  3  (BTT)  8  ]  3&#8208;  (X=O  2  , N  2  , and H  2  ), we unequivocally establish the role of spin&#8208;states and spin&#8208;coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The O  2  binding to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a Cr(III) superoxo species (O  2  &#8208;&#8226;  ) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, while N  2  /H  2  found to weakly interact with the metal centre and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas bound and unbound MOFs have S =0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin&#8208;state with a significant energy margin (47.6 kJ/mol). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of utilizing spin&#8208;state/spin&#8208;couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8211;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8211;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8211;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and Csubstituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline  1  was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[  b  ][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of  1  , which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complexes of singly, doubly and triply linked Porphyrins and Corroles: An Insight into the Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free  meso  and b positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibril structure demonstrates the role of iodine labelling on a pentapeptide self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules  via  several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa and Delta variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed&#160;  K  d  &#160;values ranging from 2 &#8208; 10 nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized&#160; pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with&#160;  K  d  &#160;values between 20 &#8208; 50 pM , and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. &#160;This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa and Delta variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one-round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high-throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed&#160;  K  d  &#160;values ranging from 2 - 10 nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments.

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate via two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient synthesis of oxaboracyclic compounds based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbone and phase&#8208;dependent luminescence of their chelate complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO  2  , DMF, Me  2  Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH  4  or NaBH  4  . The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar 7&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (  p  K  a  ranges from 3.1&#8722;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission band maximum (480&#8722;527 nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8722;95%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the germanium distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 zeolites by density functional theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like  d4r  units and [4&#183;5  6  ] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of  d4r  cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages, in accordance with  19  F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#183;5  6  ] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge = 6).. Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding  19  F&#8208;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular detection of a mitochondria targeted brominated vinyl triphenylamine optical probe (TP&#8208;Br) by X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as&#160;two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine  &#160;TP&#8208;2Bzim  are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two  TP&#8208;2Bzim  derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the  TP&#8208;RePyta  probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the  TP&#8208;Br  probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labeling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of  TP&#8208;Br  was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of  TP&#8208;Br  and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>The apparently unreactive substrate facilitates the electron transfer for dioxygen activation in Rieske dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive O2 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to O2 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of O2, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme FeII center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic O2 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme FeII sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme FeII in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive O2 activation.</dc:description>

Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non-heme FeII in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive O2 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Lewis Acid&#8208;Initiated Double Arylation of Aldehyde: A Facile Approach Towards the Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;breast Cancer Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8208;1.0 mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product = 475 and for unsymmetrical product = 390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes&#8208;based biological relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. A total synthesis of anti&#8208;breast cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>H/F substitution induced large increase of Tc in a 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite multifunctional compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing attention to study perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains significant challenges to simultaneously achieve multifunction and control of structural phase transition temperature in hybrid compounds. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ = quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2 RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ = 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169 K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution generated Rb&#8722;F coordinate between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, this reaction is even today mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8208;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8208;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8208;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective catalysis via single Zr atom catalysis in chelated cage embedded in a flexible piezoelectrical matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridyzing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90% after 100 min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient oligomerization of aromatic amino acids induced by gaps in four&#8208;helix bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA&#8208;induced are of particular interest. We had previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5'&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HB's. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of anionic backbone in NHC&#8208;stabilized coinage metal complexes: New precursors for atomic layer deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(  tBu  NHC)(R)] (M = Cu, Ag;  tBu  NHC = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160 &#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor phase processing of thin films.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well&#8208;suited for DEL synthesis. Existing examples on micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8208;H Functionalization Reactions under Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8208;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization processes. Herein, this review critically highlights the major advances and discoveries made in the enantioselective C&#8208;H functionalization under gold catalysis which is accompanied by mechanistic insights at appropriate places.</dc:description>
