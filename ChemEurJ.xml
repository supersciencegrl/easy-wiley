         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal free method for the synthesis of meta &#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta &#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (30&#8208;81%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Allylic Amines by Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes with Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical and symmetrical alkynes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with tertiary amines in the presence of a cationic titanium catalyst system, which is generated in&#8197;situ. The products obtained are synthetically and pharmaceutically very interesting tertiary allylamines, which are formed in very good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent stereoselectivity. A major highlight of the work is the successful conversion of trimethylamine into N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;E&#8208;allylamines.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes with tertiary amines take place in the presence of catalytic amounts of TiBn4, Ph3C[B(C6F5)4], and a sterically demanding aminopyridinato ligand precursor. The resulting products, synthetically and pharmaceutically useful tertiary &#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic amines, are formed in convincing yields and with excellent stereoselectivity. Particularly promising for future applications is the fact that even the industrial side product trimethylamine can be used as a substrate.

         <title>Novel Lipophilic Fluorophores with Highly Acidity&#8208;Dependent Two&#8208;Photon Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon photophysical characterization of four novel lipophilic pH probes based on phosphazene modified coumarin&#8208;151. These probes are shown to have spectral features robust to variation of local polarity from different solvents, yet display easily separable neutral and protonated forms, with maximum 2PA brightness of, &#963;2PA&#8901;&#981;em=10&#8211;13&#8197;GM. Nonlinear optical properties are quantitatively determined experimentally and compared to computational models.







Abstract
Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine the high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Herein we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region &#955;2PA=550&#8211;1000&#8197;nm, observing 2PA cross sections of &#963;2PA=10&#8211;20&#8197;GM, with an associated 2PEF brightness of 10&#8211;13&#8197;GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and n&#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.

         <title>A Masked Form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow Intermediate for the Diastereoselective FLP&#8208;Type Activation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compound 3 featuring an FLP&#8208;type activated CO2 is used as a masked form of an elusive O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the complete diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes. Kinetic and theoretical investigations shed light on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry is unprecedented. Described herein is the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds 4&#8211;8) and in solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (compounds 4&#8211;6). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.

         <title>Cellular detection of a mitochondria targeted brominated vinyl triphenylamine optical probe (TP&#8208;Br) by X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as&#160;two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine  &#160;TP&#8208;2Bzim  are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two  TP&#8208;2Bzim  derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the  TP&#8208;RePyta  probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the  TP&#8208;Br  probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labeling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of  TP&#8208;Br  was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of  TP&#8208;Br  and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Isoxazolines: Method and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline  via  an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally,  in&#8208;situ  reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have also been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (timecourse) modeling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesized involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloromethyl Glycosides as Versatile Synthons to Prepare Glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monosaccharides were introduced on drug molecules to improve their solubility, metabolic stability and oral bioavailability. A new chloromethyl glycoside synthon was developed to enable the synthesis of numerous monosaccharide prodrugs.







Abstract
This work investigates the addition of monosaccharides to marketed drugs to improve their pharmacokinetic properties for oral absorption. To this end, a set of chloromethyl glycoside synthons were developed to prepare a variety of glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;prodrugs derived from 5&#8208;fluorouracil, thioguanine, propofol and losartan. Drug release was studied in&#8197;vitro using &#946;&#8208;glucosidase confirming rapid conversion of the monosaccharide prodrugs to release the parent drug, formaldehyde and the monosaccharide. To showcase this prodrug approach, a glucosyloxymethyl conjugate of the tetrazole&#8208;containing drug losartan was used for in&#8197;vivo experiments and showed complete release of the drug in a dog&#8208;model.

         <title>The Impact of Research Culture on Mental Health &amp; Diversity in STEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper focuses on key aspects of academic research culture that can impact STEM researcher mental health: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape, as well as exploring why mental health matters for researchers. Further, key recommendations are provided and actionable steps are outlined that institutions can take to make research in STEM inclusive for all.







Abstract
The onset of COVID&#8208;19, coupled with the finer lens placed on systemic racial disparities within our society, has resulted in increased discussions around mental health. Despite this, mental health struggles in research are still often viewed as individual weaknesses and not the result of a larger dysfunctional research culture. Mental health interventions in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic community often focus on what individuals can do to improve their mental health instead of focusing on improving the research environment. In this paper, we present four aspects of research that may heavily impact mental health based on our experiences as research scientists: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape. Based on these aspects, we propose systemic changes that institutions must adopt to ensure their research culture is supportive and allows everyone to thrive.

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The life of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5. Non&#8208;oxidative methane dehydroaromatization is a high&#8208;temperature reaction taking place over zeolite&#8208;based Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst. We used operando spectroscopy to monitor the structural evolution of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 during its whole lifetime: from catalyst synthesis and activation to reaction, deactivation, and regeneration. We derived spectroscopic descriptors for molybdenum precursor decomposition, reduction of dispersed Mo&#8208;oxo centers to form active sites and, finally, evolution of active sites during reductive and oxidative regeneration.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts during their whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of similar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincides with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalysts.

         <title>(Noble Gas)n&#8208;NC+ Molecular Ions in Noble Gas Matrices: Matrix Infrared Spectra and Electronic Structure Calculations</title>

CCSD(T) calculated Ng&#8722;C&#8722;N+ structures and observed frequencies. The bond lengths on top are in &#197; unit, the natural charges in blue below atoms, and the observed C&#8722;N stretching frequencies (cm&#8722;1) in a matrix of noble gas on right side. Reactions of laser ablated Zn, Cd, and Hg atoms with HCN have provided an opportunity to observe photoionization of CN, giving a new band at 1933.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the region of CN and CN+ gas phase fundamental absorptions. The absorption that appeared in annealing to 20&#8197;K and disappeared on UV photolysis has been assigned to (Ar)nCN+.







Abstract
An investigation of pulsed&#8208;laser&#8208;ablated Zn, Cd and Hg metal atom reactions with HCN under excess argon during co&#8208;deposition with laser&#8208;ablated Hg atoms from a dental amalgam target also provided Hg emissions capable of photoionization of the CN photo&#8208;dissociation product. A new band at 1933.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the region of the CN and CN+ gas&#8208;phase fundamental absorptions that appeared upon annealing the matrix to 20&#8197;K after sample deposition, and disappeared upon UV photolysis is assigned to (Ar)nCN+, our key finding. It is not possible to determine the n coefficient exactly, but structure calculations suggest that one, two, three or four argon atoms can solvate the CN+ cation in an argon matrix with C&#8722;N absorptions calculated (B3LYP) to be between 2317.2 and 2319.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Similar bands were observed in solid krypton at 1920.5, in solid xenon at 1935.4 and in solid neon at 1947.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. H13CN reagent gave an 1892.3 absorption with shift instead, and a 12/13 isotopic frequency ratio&#8211;nearly the same as found for 13CN+ itself in the gas phase and in the argon matrix. The CN+ molecular ion serves as a useful infrared probe to examine Ng clusters. The following ion reactions are believed to occur here: the first step upon sample deposition is assisted by a focused pulsed YAG laser, and the second step occurs on sample annealing: (Ar)2++CN&#8594;Ar+CN+&#8594;(Ar)nCN+.

         <title>Orthogonal Catalysis for an Enantioselective Domino Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8722;Alder/Substitution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Thioether substituted trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalines have been accessed through a novel enantioselective domino process. Lewis acid activation and organocatalysis were combined to generate the products from readily available substances. A new chiral amine catalyst ensures high enantiomeric ratios. Both enantiomers of the product can be derived and the configuration on the newly generated stereo centers were unambiguously related to the chirality of the amine.







Abstract
An enantioselective domino process for the synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes has been developed by the combination of chiral amines and a bidentate Lewis acid in an orthogonal catalysis. This new method is based on an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder and a subsequent group exchange reaction. An enamine is generated in&#8197;situ from an aldehyde and a chiral secondary amine catalyst that reacts with phthalazine, activated by the coordination to a bidentate Lewis acid catalyst. The absolute configuration of the product is controlled by chiral information provided by the amine. The formed ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediate is then transformed via a group exchange reaction with thiols. The new method shows a broad scope and tolerates a wide range of functional groups with enantiomeric ratios up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9. All&#8208;in&#8208;all, this enantioselective synthesis tool provides an easy access to complex 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes starting from readily available phthalazine, aldehydes and thiols in a combinatorial way.

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on a Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;Pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>

A surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex for one&#8208;pot catalysis: A one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefin is developed. The hydrosilylation reaction is accelerated in the presence of a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex developed on the surface of SiO2. The decrease in steric hindrance and electron donation from iodide to Rh promote the catalytic process.







Abstract
In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between an immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N+I&#8722;) on SiO2. In the presence of ammonium cations, the SiO2&#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex could be effectively used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxy olefins, hydrosilanes, and CO2. The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the CO2 cycloaddition were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N+I&#8722;), respectively. The catalyst exhibited much higher performance for hydrosilylation than solely the Rh complex on SiO2. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N+I&#8722;, were investigated by using Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of a Rh&#8722;I bond. The Rh unit was in its electron&#8208;rich state. Curve&#8208;fitting analysis of the Rh K&#8208;edge EXAFS profiles suggests dissociation of the cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to a decrease in steric hindrance and the electron&#8208;rich state of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD, and the electron&#8208;rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a one&#8208;pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as a determination of a novel surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex and its catalysis.

         <title>Molecular Modelling and Simulations of Light&#8208;Harvesting Decanuclear Ru&#8208;Based Dendrimers for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Molucular simulations on the structure of a decanuclear Ru&#8208;based dendrimer capable to play the role of antenna for artificial photosynthesis is performed. Aggregation of dendrimers is also modelled and compared to experimental results obtained by SAXS, scanning tunneling electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
The structure of a decanuclear photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active dendrimer based on Ru(II) polypyridine subunits, suitable as a light&#8208;harvesting multicomponent species for artificial photosynthesis, has been investigated by means of computer modelling. The compound has the general formula [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru[(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru(bpy)2]2}3](PF6)20 (Ru10; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; dpp=2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazine). The stability of possible isomers of each monomer was investigated by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations on each monomer and comparing the results. The number of stable isomers is reduced to 36 with a prevalence of MER isomerism in the central core, as previously observed by NMR experiments. The simulations on decanuclear dendrimers suggest that the stability of the dendrimer is not linked to the stability of the individual monomers composing the dendrimer but rather governed by the steric constrains originated by the multimetallic assembly. Finally, the self&#8208;aggregation of Ru10 and the distribution of the counterions around the complexes is investigated using Molecular Dynamics both in implicit and explicit acetonitrile solution. In representative examples, with nine and four dendrimers, the calculated pair distribution function for the ruthenium centers suggests a self&#8208;aggregation mechanism in which the dendrimers are approaching in small blocks and then aggregate all together. Scanning transmission electron microscopy complements the investigation, supporting the formation of different aggregates at various concentrations.

Anthracene congestion: 1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing radially shaped &#960;&#8208;clusters were constructed by using PdI&#8208;catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions. The presence of &#960;&#8208;congestion as well as intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between anthracene units in the crystalline state gives these substances unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamics associated with the radially arranged &#960;&#8208;system were elucidated by using transient absorption measurements.







Abstract
We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of the two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamic behavior occurring between the three anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with approximately 3.0&#8197;&#197; between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of two unprecedented steps is described to build acyclic stereotriads bearing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter. The sequence combines a highly diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction from readily available starting materials with an acylative double organocatalyzed kinetic resolution (DoCKR) providing enantioenriched products. This method is practically simple, general, and flexible affording different diastereomers depending on the initial substrates. A mechanistic study supports the observed stereochemistry of fluorinated products.







Abstract
Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction directly generates a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5).

         <title>Being Positive is Not Everything &#8211; Experimental and Computational Studies on the Selectivity of a Self&#8208;Assembled, Multiple Redox&#8208;State Receptor that Binds Anions with up to Picomolar Affinities</title>

         <dc:description>
The interaction of a redox&#8208;active trinuclear, self&#8208;assembled Ru metallomacrocycle with oxo&#8208;anions is reported and its affinity for these anions and halides in different oxidation states is calculated, revealing both high affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for some guests) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1). Detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies on the host in each of its oxidation states, revealed that it binds anion guests by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions, including charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The interaction of the self&#8208;assembled trinuclear ruthenium bowl 13+, that displays three other accessible oxidation states, with oxo&#8208;anions is investigated. Using a combination of NMR and electrochemical experimental data, estimates of the binding affinities of 14+, 15+, and 16+ for both halide and oxo&#8208;anions were derived. This analysis revealed that, across the range of oxidation states of the host, both high anion binding affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for specific guests bound to 16+) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) were observed. As the crystal structure of binding of the hexafluorophosphate anion revealed that the host has two potential binding sites (named the &#945; and &#946; pockets), the host&#8208;guest properties of both putative binding sites of the bowl, in all of its four oxidation states, were investigated through detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies. These studies revealed that, due to the interplay of ion&#8208;ion interactions, charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, binding to the &#945; pocket is generally preferred, except for the case of the relatively large and lipophilic hexafluorophosphate anionic guest and the host in the highest oxidation states, where the &#946; pocket becomes relatively favourable. This analysis confirms that host&#8208;guest interactions involving structurally complex supramolecular architectures are driven by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions and, even in the case of charged binding pairs, simple ion&#8208;ion interactions alone cannot accurately define these recognition processes.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Characterising a Weak Halogen Bond in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very weak halogen bonds are excessively difficult to characterise in solution. We present an approach for the detailed NMR spectroscopic description of very weak interactions, providing the solution ensemble of the flexible model compound, the accurate geometry of the binding sites and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters. Here NOE abbreviates nuclear Overhauser effect, RDC corresponds to residual dipolar coupling, and &#916;T indicates variable temperature experiments.







Abstract
Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8208;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.

Compounds [1]+.[R]&#8722; and [1]2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[R]&#8722; have been prepared from the respective one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron transfer reactions of 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (1) by using the transferable organometallic oxidants and characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;transferable oxidants such as B(C6F5)3/nBuLi, B(C6F5)3/LiB(C6F5)4, B(C6F5)3/LiHBEt3, Al(C6F5)3/(o&#8208;RC6H4)AlH2 (R=N(CMe2CH2)2CH2), B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, Al(C6F5)3, Al(C6F5)3/nBuLi, Al(C6F5)3/AlMe3, (CuC6F5)4, and Ag2SO4, respectively were employed for reactions with (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2, 1). The stable radical cation [1]+. was formed and paired with the anions [nBuB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 2), [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (in 3), [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 4), [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 5), {[(C6F5)3Al]2(&#956;&#8208;F)]&#8722; (in 6), [nBuAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 7), and [Cu(C6F5)2]&#8722; (in 8), respectively. The stable dication [1]2+ was also generated with the anions [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (9) and [MeAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (10), respectively. In addition, the neutral compound [(L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2][&#956;&#8208;O2S(O)2] (11) was obtained. Compounds 2&#8211;11 are characterized by UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and elemental analysis. Compounds 2&#8211;8 are analyzed by EPR spectroscopy and compounds 9&#8211;11 by NMR spectroscopy. The structure features are discussed on the central Si2C4&#8208;rings of 1, [1]+., [1]2+, and 11, respectively.

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Dependent AIE Fluorophore Based on HBT Derivative: Substituent Positional Impact on Aggregated Luminescence and its Application for Hydrogen Peroxide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two positional isomers are presented, p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT, and their structural feature is mainly different in one BT substituent position on HBT fluorophore. Surprisingly, they exhibited totally opposite luminescence behaviour in water/THF cosolvents with different water volume fractions (fw). More importantly, the unique AIE&#8208;ESIPT properties allowed p&#8208;BHBT to construct the chemosensor, Probe&#8208;1, for highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.







Abstract
Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to p&#8208;BHBT and ortho position refers to o&#8208;BHBT). Fluorescence emission properties of p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which p&#8208;BHBT showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while o&#8208;BHBT displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, Probe&#8208;1, generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore p&#8208;BHBT, was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22&#8197;&#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.

         <title>Solvothermal Synthesis of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with Magnetically Frustrated [Cr7S8]5+ Double&#8208;Cubes**

Novel compound, [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O was synthesized by using DMSO as a source of sulfur in solvothermal synthesis. Crystal structure is composed of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]3+ units connected into 2D layers by bridging ethylenediamine ligands. Magnetic interactions between Cr3+ centers in [Cr7S8]5+ core units were studied using magnetometry and DFT calculations. Strong antiferromagnetic coupling was observed in the peripheral Cr3 triangles as well as between central and peripheral Cr atoms of the Cr7 cluster leading to high degree of frustration.







Abstract
A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters, has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi&#8208; and monodentate coordination modes; in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8&#8197;K, a highly negative Weiss constant, &#952;=&#8722;224(2)&#8197;K, obtained from Curie&#8208;Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility, suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S=3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S+1)7=16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1=&#8722;21.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;30.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with J1=&#8722;20.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;21.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr3+ ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr3+ ions. This compound is proposed as a synthon towards magnetically frustrated systems assembled by linking dicubane transition metal&#8208;chalcogenide clusters into polymeric networks.

Strong antiferromagnetic coupling was observed in the peripheral Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; triangles as well as between central and peripheral Cr atoms of the Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; cluster leading to high degree of frustration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(en)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with [Cr&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; dicubane cationic clusters, has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (&lt;i&gt;en&lt;/i&gt;) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi- and monodentate coordination modes; in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8&#8197;K, a highly negative Weiss constant, &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;=&#8722;224(2)&#8197;K, obtained from Curie-Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility, suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;+1)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;=16384 microstates from seven Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;21.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;30.2&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; center and the peripheral Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;20.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;21.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This compound is proposed as a synthon towards magnetically frustrated systems assembled by linking dicubane transition metal-chalcogenide clusters into polymeric networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminium Fumarate Extrudates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pinch of binder, a pinch of MOF: The effect of co&#8208;extruding aluminium fumarate with either clays or silica gel binders has been investigated. Textural, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques show the changes in porosity and surface sites, and CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms fitted an ideal Jensen&#8208;Seaton adsorption model. We have demonstrated the viability of extrusion for MOF extrudate formation and the changes associated to the process.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminium fumarate MOF with clays or SiO2 gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO2 selectivity towards CH4, of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process. Moreover, probe FTIR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.

To overcome the limits of the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(benzene)]+ have been used to prepare sandwich complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+. NMP is used to promote the substitution of naphthalene with simple arenes as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin. This compound can be used to unambiguously confirm the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;arene sandwich complexes are generally prepared by the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, which conditions are incompatible with most O&#8208; and N&#8208; functional groups. We report a new way for the synthesis of sandwich type complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+ from [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+, with functionalized arenes and pharmaceuticals. N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (NMP) facilitates the substitution of naphthalene with the incoming arene. A series of fully characterized rhenium sandwich complexes with simple arenes, such as aniline, as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin are presented. With these rhenium compounds in hand, the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+ (pharm=pharmaceutical) can be unambiguously confirmed. The direct labelling of pharmaceuticals with 99mTc through &#951;6&#8208;coordination to phenyl rings and the confirmation of the structures with the rhenium homologues opens a path into molecular theranostics.

Photosensitizer: The first BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) has been synthesized and obtained as two atropisomers. The presence of the BOPHY light&#8208;harvesting antenna in the dyad increases the absorption of the fullerene moiety in the visible region and improves its photodynamic action. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer processes (EnT/PeT) take place from BOPHY to fullerene C60. The dyad exhibits an efficient production of reactive oxygen species. BP&#8208;C60 is a promising heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer with potential application in photodynamic treatments..







Abstract
A novel BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatment and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications. BP&#8208;C60 consists of a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a C60 moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. The BOPHY core works as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C60 subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8211;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C60. Photodynamic studies indicate that BP&#8208;C60 produces ROS by both photomechanisms (type&#8197;I and type&#8197;II). Moreover, the dyad exhibits higher ROS production efficiency than its individual constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) demonstrated the ability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.

         <title>A Ferroelectric Metallomesogen Exhibiting Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>

A multifunctional Co(II) compound exhibiting liquid crystal, ferroelectricity, and field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior has been synthesized for the first time. The results provide new insights towards the development of a new category of magnetoelectric (ME) materials.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) materials exhibiting coupled electric and magnetic properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in memory storage devices, new sensors, or low&#8208;consumption devices. Herein, we report a new category of ME material that shows liquid crystal (LC), ferroelectric (FE), and field&#8208;induced single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviors. Co(II) complex incorporating alkyl chains of type [Co(3C16&#8208;bzimpy)2](BF4)2 (1; 3C16&#8208;bzimpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;hexadecyloxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;hexadecyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)) displayed a chiral smectic C mesophase in the temperature range 321&#8197;K&#8211;458&#8197;K, in which distinct FE behavior was observed, with a remnant polarization (88.3&#8197;nC&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Complex 1 also exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior that reflects the large magnetic anisotropy of the Co(II) center. Furthermore, the dielectric property of 1 was able to be tuned by an external magnetic field occurring from both spin&#8208;lattice coupling and molecular orientational variation. Clearly, this multifunctional compound, combining LC, FE, and SMM properties, represents an entry to the development of a range of next&#8208;generation ME materials.

         <title>Chiral Ligands in Hypervalent Iodine Compounds: Synthesis and Structures of Binaphthyl&#8208;Based &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contained chirality: Novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents are presented with the chirality contained only in the ligand. These have been characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, and all derivatives show the prominent reactivities of hypervalent iodine reagents. Due to their limited stability in solution, they are inefficient chiral iodine(III) derivatives.







Abstract
Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analysed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed; however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. NMR experiments indicated that these reagents are very easily hydrolysed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to the limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.

         <title>Coordination Cage&#8208;Based Emulsifiers: Templated Formation of Metal Oxide Microcapsules Monitored by In Situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>

Self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles captured in action: Non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic coordination cages results in Gemini amphiphiles, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions. Serving as water&#8208;free medium, the emulsion&#8208;templated synthesis of metal oxide microcapsules from water&#8208;sensitive precursors can be carried out in controlled fashion. The formation of hollow metal oxide microcapsules was visualized by in&#8197;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (CGA&#8208;3; CGA=Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques. In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.

A simple, radially arranged, highly anthracene congested 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene has been synthesized in a Negishi coupling reaction with a PdI catalyst. This beautiful three&#8208;anthracene clustered structure shows unique behavior in both the solid and excited states, but work is still in progress. There are three more anthracenes on the wooden desk for construction of the final target: hexa(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, H. Sotome, K. Shimizu, H. Miyasaka, and T. Kubo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104245).

         <title>Cover Feature: BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (Chem. Eur. J. 5/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BOPHY&#8208;based photosensitizer (PS) has been obtained as a mixture of two atropisomers. The BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting center and donor antenna, while a fullerene C60 acceptor acts as an effective spin converter and triggers photodynamic action. The dyad is capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) by both photodynamic mechanisms. In&#8208;vitro studies indicate that the dyad photokills microorganisms after visible light irradiation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;A. Heredia et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103884).

Surface Rh species with three iodine atoms showed a high catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of terminal olefins. The picture indicates three iodides with an ammonium cation &#8220;tent&#8221; coordinate to Rh, and the hydrosilylation reaction occurs at the electron&#8208;rich Rh site. Next, the intermediate reacts with CO2 coming from the factory with the assistance of an iodide, then the final product silyl carbonate is formed. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Motokura et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104001).

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics are attractive for the host&#8208;guest structure, where the guest cation is anchored in the host crown ether and the anion acts as the counterion. Their crystal structure, phase transition and ferroelectric properties are discussed in this minireview. Additionally, an outlook on the chemical design of high&#8208;performance crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics is given.







Abstract
In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their low weight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>19F MRI Probes for Multimodal Imaging**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic resonance is one of the most effective imaging instruments available today, capable of showing superior soft tissue contrast. Multimodal 19F MRI probes have the potential to enhance detection sensitivity and accuracy, which is crucial in disease diagnosis. This review discusses research in the integration of 19F MRI probes with other modalities, with an emphasis on the structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and image quality.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful imaging tools today, capable of displaying superior soft&#8208;tissue contrast. This review discusses developments in the field of 19F MRI multimodal probes in combination with optical fluorescence imaging (OFI), 1H MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, ultrasonography (USG), X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). In each case, multimodal 19F MRI probes compensate for the deficiency of individual techniques and offer improved sensitivity or accuracy of detection over unimodal counterparts. Strategies for designing 19F MRI multimodal probes are described with respect to their structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and the quality of images.

         <title>Solution Phase Reactivity of Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine: Activation and Insertion into Si&#8208;E Single Bonds (E=H, OSi(CH3)3, F, Cl) by a BN&#8208;Aryne</title>

Si&#8208;F Bond Activation: The BN triple bond of a BN&#8208;aryne is extremely reactive and can even activate the inert Si&#8722;F bond for insertion in solution. The mechanism involves coordinative interaction between the boron and fluorine atoms followed by nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom on silicon.







Abstract
The boron&#8208;nitrogen analogue of ortho&#8208;benzyne, 1,2&#8208;azaborinine, is a reactive intermediate that features a formal boron&#8208;nitrogen triple bond. We here show by combining experimental and computational techniques that the Lewis acidity of the boron center of dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine allows interaction with the silicon containing single bonds Si&#8722;E through the silicon bonding partner E (E=F, Cl, OR, H). The binding to boron activates the Si&#8722;E bonds for subsequent insertion reaction. This shows that the BN&#8208;aryne is a ferocious species that even can activate and insert into the very strong Si&#8722;F bond.

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>

Cellular uptake of high&#8208;density brush polymers with peptide side chains is governed by the net charge of the polymers. Stimuli responsive cleavable linkers are employed to control the charge of the polymers and to trigger cellular uptake of brush polymers possessing a net positive charge.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids through stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Assignment of (&#8722;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constitutional reassignment and configurational assignment of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A, an irregularly assembled polyketide from the ascomycete Fusarium equiseti, was accomplished by total synthesis. Structural assignment fuels the proposition that Podospora curvicolla (order Sordiales) and Fusarium equiseti (order Hypocreales) possess a common biosynthetic machinery to produce polyketides of solitary architecture.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A is an irregularly assembled polyketide isolated from the ascomycete Fusarium equiseti. Fusaequisin A shares a carbon backbone with curvicollide C from the ascomycete Podospora curvicolla but its absolute configuration remained hitherto unsettled. Herein, we document the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A and its 4&#8208;O&#8208;desmethyl derivative following a central&#8208;to&#8208;lateral building block strategy. Catalytic asymmetric Claisen rearrangement, Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination and olefin cross&#8208;metathesis served as key C/C&#8208;connecting transformations. The constitution and absolute configuration of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A was deduced and the original structural assignment was adjusted.

         <title>The Shuttling Cascade in Lasso Peptide Benenodin&#8208;1 is Controlled by Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 5, January 24, 2022. </description>

Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step: The naturally occurring peptide [1]rotaxane benenodin&#8208;1 undergoes a shuttling cascade under thermal activation and can be switched between four different states in water. The mechanism of wheel translation is reminiscent of synthetically derived molecular shuttles. Switchable peptide rotaxanes pave the way for a new generation of functional mechanically interlocked architectures solely made from biomolecules.







Abstract
The lasso peptide benenodin&#8208;1, a naturally occurring and bacterially produced [1]rotaxane, undergoes a reversible zip tie&#8208;like motion under heat activation, in which a peptidic wheel stepwise translates along a molecular thread in a cascade of &#8220;tail/loop pulling&#8221; equilibria. Conformational and structural analyses of four translational isomers, in solution and in the gas phase, reveal that the equilibrium distribution is controlled by mechanical and non&#8208;covalent forces within the lasso peptide. Furthermore, each dynamic pulling step is accompanied by a major restructuring of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between wheel and thread, which affects the peptide's physico&#8208;chemical properties.

Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts are prepared from iron complex precursors containing 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene ligands with two bromo substituents by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. The iron complex precursors were efficiently converted to atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 active sites without generating less active iron aggregates during pyrolysis. The Fe&#8722;N4 active sites were identified by STEM&#8208;EELS observations and in&#8197;situ electrochemical Fe K edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic measurements. The Fe/N/C catalysts show high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;Nx sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N4 sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N4 sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21&#8197;e&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N4 sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.

         <title>The apparently unreactive substrate facilitates the electron transfer for dioxygen activation in Rieske dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive O2 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to O2 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of O2, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme FeII center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic O2 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme FeII sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme FeII in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive O2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Boronic acids. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings, providing a valuable molecular insight into the rational design of novel catalysts and inhibitors.







Abstract
Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids; specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8722;Organic Cages and Counterions Regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When introducing extra salts into Cage 1 aqueous solution, most salts (Na2SO4, NaNO3, NaClO4, and NaSCN) can trigger larger&#8208;sized blackberry; while no clear change can be observed for Cage 2 solution, except NaSCN, which can be attribute to the thick hydration shell of Cage 2, inhibiting the counterion&#8211;macroion interaction.







Abstract
A unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8722;organic cages (MOCs) and external counteranions in aqueous media was observed. Similar to many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures through counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counteranions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.

These cations were prepared in superacidic media starting from &#946;&#8208;propiolactam under the reaction conditions described on their labels. In the lower part of the picture is a Petri dish containing a mold culture representing penicillinium, which carries the &#946;&#8208;propiolactam motif as an important component. The magnifying glass highlights the ring structure, and the scissors show where cleavage occurs in superacids. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104086).

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crystallographically characterized phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct mimics frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair reactivity. In the presence of alkynes, alkenes and esters, a facile conversion to novel phosphinine&#8208;based species is achieved even at room temperature. Our results provide fascinating new perspectives for the future, particularly with respect to the activation of small molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104135).

         <title>Sandacrabins &#8211; Structurally Unique Antiviral RNA Polymerase Inhibitors from a Rare Myxobacterium**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;nucleoside RdRp inhibitors. A family of unprecedented farnesylated dimethylbenzimidazoles called the sandacrabins have been discovered from a new myxobacterial Sandaracinus species. They exhibit antiviral activities that could be correlated to inhibition of the RNA synthesis as their potential antiviral mode of action. This study describes their structure elucidation, biosynthetic origin, total synthesis and biological evaluation.







Abstract
Structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, are reported, alongside with the first description of their producing organism Sandaracinus defensii MSr10575, which expands the Sandaracineae family by only its second member. The genome sequence of S. defensii as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic use of metallic couples acting in a cooperative way arises as a powerful tool affording novel and efficient chemical transformations. In this article, a series of complexes containing M&#8722;M&#8242; bonds (M=Pd, Pt; M&#8242;=Ag, Au) is described. They can be regarded as arrested intermediates or snapshots of a transmetallation process that becomes &#8220;frustrated&#8221; given the nature of the &#8220;disputed&#8221; R fragment. Still, some gradation in the transfer can be evaluated depending on the M&#8722;M&#8242; couple, and all together they compose a short movie allowing the progression of such processes to be ranked. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya, A. Mart&#237;n, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104538).

Bistable spin&#8208;state switching near room temperature: Two mononuclear iron(II) complexes showing technologically relevant abrupt and wide hysteretic, bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics in the vicinity of room temperature are reported. The large structural reorganizations from the Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;distorted high&#8208;spin state to the less distorted low&#8208;spin state and ethyl group conformational switching are proposed as the main contributing factors rendering the switching hysteretic.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Features of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the prefusion conformation of the spike protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 can be stabilized alone, a spontaneously and energy&#8208;friendly centripetal movement of the receptor binding domain occurs when spike protein binds to ACE2. During the binding process, several residues, especially Phe329 and Phe515, play a significant role in the allosteric effect. As a result, two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2&#8242; are exposed on the surface. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Zhang, J. Fu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104215).

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations in the Substrate&#8208;Binding Pocket of Taurine/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate Dioxygenase Determine its Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on large active site models of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase show that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects of polar and charged amino acid residues are essential for the correct description of the regioselectivity of taurine activation by this enzyme. In particular, a charged histidine residue incurs a local electric field effect that guides the reactivity to C1&#8208;hydroxylation.







Abstract
Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C1&#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C2&#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C1&#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD was performed. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the pro&#8208;R C1&#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. The large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.

         <title>Release of Molecular Cargo from Polymer Systems by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical design: The incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, known as mechanophores, into macromolecular systems has provided access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. We present examples of molecular cargo release systems and their sonochemical activation by ultrasound. Important design concepts of these advanced materials, as well as their synthesis and applications, are discussed.







Abstract
The design and manipulation of (multi)functional materials at the nanoscale holds the promise of fuelling tomorrow's major technological advances. In the realm of macromolecular nanosystems, the incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, so called mechanophores, has resulted in unprecedented access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. Among the diverse force&#8208;activated motifs, the on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds, such as catalysts, drugs, or monomers for self&#8208;healing, are sought&#8208;after since they enable triggering pristine small molecule function from macromolecular frameworks. Here, we highlight examples of molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution by means of sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry). Important design concepts of these advanced materials are discussed, as well as their syntheses and applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8208;1.0 mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product = 475 and for unsymmetrical product = 390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes&#8208;based biological relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. A total synthesis of anti&#8208;breast cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Aldol Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Alkyl Aryl Ketones: Silanes as Activator and Transient Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reductive aldol reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed in the presence of copper/bisphosphine catalysts. The reaction demonstrated the usability of in situ protection of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane for the reductive C&#8722;C bond formation. The Si&#8722;O bond in the aldol products is readily cleaved by a standard workup, showing the silane worked as not only an activator but also a transient protecting group.







Abstract
The first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with an alkyl aryl ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.

         <title>H/F substitution induced large increase of Tc in a 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite multifunctional compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing attention to study perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains significant challenges to simultaneously achieve multifunction and control of structural phase transition temperature in hybrid compounds. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ = quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2 RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ = 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169 K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution generated Rb&#8722;F coordinate between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, this reaction is even today mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8208;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8208;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8208;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in FLP&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two B  II  atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8208;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8208;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B  2  (hpp)  2  (OTf)  2  (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and a phosphino&#8208;pyridine, establishing B&#8208;N and B&#8208;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8208;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8208;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>On the road for more efficient biocompatible two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red to NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3 650 GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective catalysis via single Zr atom catalysis in chelated cage embedded in a flexible piezoelectrical matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridyzing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90% after 100 min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.</dc:description>

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Roll out the barrelene: The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct has been achieved for the first time. The novel Lewis adduct shows rapid insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene, whereas a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. Reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These subsequently undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of alkenes and alkynes to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.







Abstract
A phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct of a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 has been synthesized and characterized crystallographically for the first time. The reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8211;borane adducts that is determined by the Lewis basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. A hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8722;C&#8801;CH and styrene to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.

&lt;p&gt;A phosphinine-borane adduct of a Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si-functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been synthesized and characterized crystallographically for the first time. The reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;-position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8211;borane adducts that is determined by the Lewis basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;-B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. A hitherto unknown dihydro-1-phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;C&#8801;CH and styrene to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-phosphabarrelenium salts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bright Luminescence by Combining Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane with a Boron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Building Block</title>

Coupling through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space by a chiral building block results in excellent optical and chiroptical properties: &#1013; up to 2.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#934;PL up to 0.70, and intense, mirror&#8208;image electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals of a magnitude of 10&#8722;3 for the absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
Novel BN&#8208;doped compounds based on chiral, tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane and NBN&#8208;benzo[f,g]tetracene were synthesized by Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara coupling. Conjugated ethynyl linkers allow electronic communication between the &#960;&#8208;electron systems through&#8208;bond, whereas through&#8208;space interactions are provided by strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap between the pairs of NBN&#8208;building blocks. Excellent optical and chiroptical properties in racemic and enantiopure conditions were measured, with molar absorption coefficients up to &#1013;=2.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934;PL=0.70, and intense, mirror&#8208;image electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals of the magnitude of 10&#8722;3 for the absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors. Computed glum,calcd. values match the experimental ones. Electroanalytical data show both oxidation and reduction of the ethynyl&#8208;linked tetra&#8208;NBN&#8208;substituted paracyclophane, with an overlap of two redox processes for oxidation leading to a diradical dication.

         <title>Ferroelectrics in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure, nature and future: This review classifies ferroelectric photocatalysts into perovskite, layered bismuth&#8208;based and other materials based on their crystal structure. Progress in ferroelectrics research is then summarized including photocatalytic pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, current challenges and future prospects are provided with the purpose for presenting a deep insight and guideline for future research into ferroelectrics.







Abstract
The rapid development of industrialization and population has brought water, air&#8208;pollution and energy crises. Solar&#8208;driven catalysis is expected to relieve these issues. However, limited by poor light harvesting, serious charge recombination of semiconductors, and high surface reaction barriers, the low efficiency of solar conversion is far from satisfactory for industrial needs. Ferroelectrics are considered to be promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3 and LiNbO3, layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, and other ferroelectrics are introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method are highlighted. Subsequently, research progress in ferroelectrics for photocatalysis is summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts are provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present deep insight and a guideline for future research work into ferroelectrics.

         <title>Interstitial Hydrides in Nanoclusters can Reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and Form Stable Superatoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept proposes that interstitial hydrides in high&#8208;nuclearity coinage metal nanoclusters can reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and form stable superatoms. This implies the hydride species can induce internal self&#8208;redox reactions (no external reducing agent needed) but as prerequisite the transformed clusters seem to have a similar core framework structure. These observations have implications in catalytic and energy cycles.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity clusters resemble the closest model between the determination of atomically precise chemical species and the bulk metallic version thereof, and both impacts on a variety of applications, including catalysis, optics, sensors, and new energy sources. Our interest lies with the nanoclusters of the Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) metals stabilized by dichalcogenido and hydrido ligands. Herein, we describe superatoms formed by the clusters and their relationship with precursor hydrido clusters. Specifically, our concept seeks to demonstrate a possible correlation that exist between hydrido clusters (and nanoalloys) and the formation of superatoms, with the loss of hydrides and typically with release of H2 gas. These reactions appear to be internal self&#8208;redox reactions and require no additional reducing agent, but does seem to require a similar core structure. Knowledge of such processes could provide insight into how clusters grow and an understanding in bridging the atomically precise cluster &#8211; metal nanoparticle mechanism.

         <title>Unlocking the hydrolytic mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;mannosidases: computation inspires using C&#8208;glycosides as Michaelis complex mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2 &#8594; B2,5 &#8594; 1S5 and 3S1 &#8594; 3H4 &#8594; 1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1 &#8594; 4H5/1S5 &#8594; 1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH&#8217;s natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5 &#8594; B2,5/1S5 &#8594; 1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.</dc:description>

Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA&#8208;induced are of particular interest. We had previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5'&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HB's. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation of Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be and Mg (Route&#8208;I), to Pb (Route&#8208;II), Zn, Cd (Route&#8208;III) in a flexible fluorooxoborate framework hierarchically enhances the optical anisotropy up to 46.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth, d10 electron configuration, and 6s2 lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework from AEB4O6F2 (AE=Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6&#8201;% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (route&#8208;I), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB4O6F2 structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146&#8197;nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm, and the PbB4O6F2 structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194&#8197;nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.

         <title>Pedal to the Metal: The Homogeneous Catalysis of the Native Chemical Ligation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic catalysis is key to the acceleration of the native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction and thus, to its application for protein synthesis, functionalization and utilization in chemical biology. The present concept article discusses the fundamental principles of NCL rate and catalysis with emphasis on thiol nucleophiles.







Abstract
The native chemical ligation reaction of peptide thioesters with cysteinyl peptides is a pivotal chemical process in the production of native or modified peptides and proteins, and well beyond in the preparation of various biomolecule analogs and materials. To benefit from this reaction at its fullest and to access all the possible applications, the experimentalist needs to know the factors affecting its rate and how to control it. This concept article presents the fundamental principles underlying the rate of the native chemical ligation and its homogeneous catalysis by nucleophiles. It has been prepared to serve as a quick guide in the search for an appropriate catalyst.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical was synthesized and exhibited a peculiarly high stability and a self&#8208;assembling ability to form a &#960;&#8208;dimer stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction. The polycondensation of the silyl&#8208;substituted TOT yielded a microporous organosiloxane with a large surface area and a micropore of &#8764;1&#8197;nm diameter. The TOT unit incorporated in the organosiloxane&#8208;wall exhibited a reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability in the chemical and electrochemical methods.







Abstract
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to TOT neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including TOT units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups and formed microporous structures with &#8764;1&#8197;nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of TOT units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the TOT units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of TOT units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.

Frustrated R&#8208;transfer processes: The catalytic use of bimetallic couples acting in a cooperative way affords novel and efficient chemical transformations. The presence of M&#8722;M&#8217; interactions is a key feature in these processes. We describe here a complete series of complexes containing G10M&#8722;G11M bonds (G10M=Pd, Pt; G11M=Ag, Au) that can be considered as snapshots of transmetallation processes. All together they compose a sort of short movie that allows to rank the progression of such processes depending on of the metals involved.







Abstract
Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh3)Pd&#8208;G11M(PPh3)](ClO4) (G11M=Au (3), Ag (4); CNC=2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh3)Pd}2G11M](ClO4) (G11M=Au (6), Ag (5)) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8722;Au &gt; Pt&#8722;Au &gt; Pd&#8722;Ag &gt; Pt&#8722;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial hyperpolarization of nuclear spins in alkene products was observed in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen mediated by a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst. The observed effects are unusual, as the mechanism of the reaction is not pairwise, thus allowing hyperpolarization of only one of two protons at double bonds. Moreover, this enabled various important intermediates to be characterized by hyperpolarized 1H, 11B and 15N NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H2 transfer to alkynes that normally prevents parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) from being observed. Nevertheless, the specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled the detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H2 intermediates through substantial 1H, 11B and 15N signal enhancement and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.

         <title>Comparative Study of Nitro&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalized ZnII&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers (CPs) as Fluorescent Turn&#8208;On Probes for Rapid and Selective Detection of H2S in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the reduction approach, newly synthesized coordination polymers (CPs) containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) was shown to exhibit an excellent ability for the detection of extracellular and intracellular H2S. The CP&#8208;1, containing azido functunal group acted as an efficient fluorencent turn&#8208;on probe with lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the reported Zn&#8208;based probes to date, whereas the nitro group containing CP&#8208;2 was unable to sense H2S due to its framework disruption.







Abstract
Selective detection of H2S in the cellular systems using fluorescent CPs/MOFs is of great scientific interest due to their outstanding aqueous stability, biocompatibility and real&#8208;time detection ability. Fabrication of such materials using complete biologically essential elements and applying them as an efficient biosensor is still quite challenging. In this context, two newly synthesized CPs containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) and nitro/azido functional groups into the framework to sense extracellular and intracellular H2S by reducing into respective amines are presented. The CP&#8208;1 containing the azide group acted as an efficient fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe with the lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the Zn&#8208;based probes reported till date. Moreover, CP&#8208;1 exhibited green luminescence in live cells after imaging a very low concentration of H2S, whereas the nitro analogue CP&#8208;2 could not detect the target analyte due to its framework disruption.

         <title>Role of anionic backbone in NHC&#8208;stabilized coinage metal complexes: New precursors for atomic layer deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(  tBu  NHC)(R)] (M = Cu, Ag;  tBu  NHC = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160 &#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor phase processing of thin films.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights into the Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Features of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution and other transformations: The binding of ACE2 triggers an obvious conformational transformation of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 spike protein. Compared with SARS&#8208;COV, several aspects of the spike protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 have evolved, including its binding affinity with ACE2 as well as the structural features of cleavage sites.







Abstract
COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of the S protein. Binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes in Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2&#8242; were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides a theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.

A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclooligomerization of bifunctional monomers possessing triazolyl (carbene precursor) and vinyl groups at 2,3&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;positions on the thiophene ring is studied. Cyclic dimers, which adopt a tub&#8208;shaped conformation, are obtained as the major components.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multilayered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D folding polymers by using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling in the presence of chiral catalysts. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Unprecedented chiral multilayer folding 3D polymers have been assembled and regulated by uniform and differentiated aromatic chromophore units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers were proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycouplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of the corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute configuration and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61&#8201;960 Mw/41&#8201;900 Mn and m/z 4317 for polymers and oligomers, as confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, indicated that these frameworks were composed of multiple stacked layers. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.

Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and substituent conformational switching &#8211; mediated hysteretic spin&#8208;state switching is reported for two mononuclear iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes. Stable hysteretic switching of &#916;T1/2=62&#8197;K and &#916;T=288&#8197;K is observed for one of the complexes: Fe[(bpp&#8722;COOEt)2](ClO4)2&#8901;CH3NO2. This complex is unprecedented for the iron(II)&#8722;bpp family and encourages the pursuit of iron(II)&#8208;based SCO complexes for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications.







Abstract
Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;T1/2) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes &#8211; [Fe(bpp&#8722;COOEt)2](X)2&#8901;CH3NO2 (X=ClO4, 1; X=BF4, 2). Stable spin&#8208;state switching &#8211; T1/2=288&#8197;K; &#916;T1/2=62&#8197;K &#8211; is observed for 1, whereas 2 undergoes above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO &#8211; T1/2=331&#8197;K; &#916;T1/2=43&#8197;K. Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations &#8211; from the Jahn&#8208;Teller&#8208;distorted HS state to the less distorted LS state &#8211; and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in 1 and 2. Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive Monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH Molecule through Nonadiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH molecule was prepared in the gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). The divergent chemistries of germanium versus carbon are reflected when comparing the acetylene isomers with the isovalent germanium analogues. This reaction deepens our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.







Abstract
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH (X1A&#8242;) molecule was prepared in the gas phase by bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). Electronic structure calculations revealed that this reaction commenced on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond over a submerged barrier to form the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH3); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH3 predominantly isomerized through two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H2GeGe) and dibridged (Ge(&#956;&#8208;H2)Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C2H2 surface, thus deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.

         <dc:description>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules provides a powerful bottom&#8208;up strategy to build functional nanostructures and materials. Among the different biomacromolecules, protein cages offer various advantages including uniform size, versatility, multi&#8208;modularity and high stability. Additionally, protein cage crystals present confined microenvironments with well&#8208;defined dimensions. On the other hand, molecular hosts, such as cyclophanes, possess a defined cavity size and selective recognition of guest molecules. However, successful combination of macrocycles and protein cages to achieve functional co&#8208;crystals have remained limited. In this study, we demonstrate the electrostatic binding between cationic pillar[5]arenes and (apo)ferritin cages, which results in porous and crystalline frameworks. The electrostatically assembled crystals present face&#8208;center cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo&#8208;TEM.

         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade C &#8208;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes has been developed. The reaction provides an efficient approach to construct chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in high levels of yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93% ee). Notably, the chromium complex works as Leiws acid to facilitate the formation of palladium carbene and to ehance acidity of carboxylic acid, allowing for higher stereochemical control and efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S  &#8208;(Trifluoromethyl) benzothioate (TFBT) is developed as an inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and user&#8208;friendly trifluoromethylthiolation reagent, which can be easily synthesized using KF as the only fluorine source. By using TFBT, trifluoromethylthiolates with various counterions can be readily obtained. The synthetic application of TFBT is demonstrated by trifluoromethylthiolation&#8722;halogenation of arynes, bis(trifluoromethylthiolation)&#8208;halogenation of 1,2&#8208;benzdiynes, nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, deoxytrifluoromethylthiolation of alcohols, and cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and vinyl boronic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Four dibenzofuran&#8208;terminated high triplet energy hole&#8208;transporters for high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit (i) high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward anion state, (ii) high glass transition temperature ( T g&#160; &gt;130 &#176;C), and (iii) high triplet energy ( E T&#160; &gt;2.7 eV), thereby enabling approximately 20% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50% (LT 50 ) of 20000&#8211;30000 h at 1000 cd m &#8208;2 . In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential ( I P ), BDE, and&#160; T g&#160; are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208; transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Random Occupation of&#160;Multi&#8208;Metal Sites in Transition Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the design of efficient high entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalyst by one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. The strategy allows for control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimising the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The environment affects the electronic density and consequently binding energies of oxygenated intermediates at the metal ion centers. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8208;2 , better than RuO 2 catalyst. The finding involves lattice distortion of the high entropy MOFs provides more strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8208;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Here, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e  &#8211;  . Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible Rh  II/I  process at &#8211;0.96 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc  +/0  ). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon Rh(II) species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]  +  , that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]  +  , and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41 V vs Fc  +/0  that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8211;H moiety by 23 p  K  a  units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by  in situ  1  H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8211;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase sensing based on protein interactions at the catalytic site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependent enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10 nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentration. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for caging living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, we report a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;driven dimerization and self&#8208;assembly of artificial, ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)&#8208;carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8211; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8208;functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (Dlabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Dlem up to 73 nm, FPL up to 51%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy (218 K), N&#8208;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (Dd) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ~12 kcal.mol&#8208;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on geometries, stereodynamics and on the large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox replacement of Ag on MOF&#8208;derived Cu/C&#8208;nanoparticles on gas diffusion electrodes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction, bime&#173;tallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to local&#173;ly increase the CO flux for maximizing the conversion rate towards C&#8208;C coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8208;Ag nanostruc&#173;tured catalyst was prepared by a redox replacement process, where the ratio of both metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO  2  conversion to C  2+  products compared to non&#8208;Ag modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and  in&#8208;situ  Raman measurements in a CO  2  gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top bound linear adsorbed &#1645;CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps as evidenced by increasing the &#957;C&#8208;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms are simultane&#173;ously operating towards the production of HCO  2  H and C&#8208;C coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Sandmeyer&#8208;type Halogenation of Arenediazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One hundred and forty years after its discovery, key limitations of the Sandmeyer reaction were overcome. The use of trihalide salts as mediators enable the photochemical conversion of diazonium salts into the corresponding aryl halides without an environmentally problematic transition&#8208;metal mediator. A wide variety of aryl bromides, chlorides and iodides were formed in excellent selectivities for halogenation over hydridodediazotization, obviating the laborious separation of halogenated products from non&#8208;halogenated analogues.@ruhrunibochum







Abstract
Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization. Convenient protocols are disclosed for synthetically meaningful brominations, iodinations, and chlorinations of diversely functionalized derivatives.

The noble&#8208;gas difluorides, NgF2 (Ng=Kr, Xe), react with MOF4 (M=Mo, W) in HF solvent and melts to form NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4. Structures and bonding were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The NgF2 ligands coordinate to the metal through F&#8208;bridges, where Fb is trans to M=O in FtNgFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 and Fb&#8217; is cis to M=O and trans to M&#8217;=O in FtXeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)Fb&#8242;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M&#8242;OF4.







Abstract
The NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 (Ng=Kr, Xe; M=Mo, W) and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 complexes were synthesized in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent and melts, respectively. Their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures show NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 have Ft&#8722;Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M arrangements, in which the NgF2 ligands coordinate to MOF4 through Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges. The XeF2 ligands of XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 also coordinate to F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 moieties through Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges to form Ft&#8722;Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4, where XeF2 coordinates trans to the M=O bond and Fb&#8217; coordinates trans to the M&#8217;=O bond. The Ng&#8722;Ft, Ng&#8722;Fb, and M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond lengths of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nMOF4 are consistent with MOF4 and F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 fluoride&#8208;ion affinity trends: CrOF4&lt;MoOF4&lt;WOF4&#8776;F3OMo&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Mo'OF4&lt;F3OW&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W'OF4. The [&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(F4OMo)(&#956;3&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;]&#8734; and [H3F2][W2O2F9] solvates were also synthesized in aHF and characterized by SCXRD. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show the M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bonds of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 are predominantly electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole type bonds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of clickable side chains and click adducts on heterochiral DNA with complementary strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and their homochiral counterparts with both strands in the &#945;&#8208;d or &#946;&#8208;d configuration is investigated. For this, the &#945;&#8208;anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized, converted to phosphoramidites, and employed in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Functionalized &#945;/&#945; DNAs are much more stable than their &#945;/&#946; and &#946;/&#946; counterparts.

Anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;d configuration were functionalized. The &#945;&#8208;d anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized and functionalized with clickable octadiynyl side chains. Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides, which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission. Tm values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;&#8208;d&#8811;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;d&#8805;&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and bulky click adducts are well accommodated in the grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology, and DNA material science.

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of ~820 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 300 cycles of at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and the improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve the enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Interaction Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer  in silico  et vitro  design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. Using a new iterative design procedure, Interaction Based Drug Design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated.
The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, we report on the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts.

These [P(CF  3  )  4&#8208;n  F  n  ]  &#8722;  (n = 0&#8208;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n = 1&#8208;2) or trifluoromethylating (n = 0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  4  ] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  3  F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of recent progress aims at the achievements of efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission with stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The stimuli&#8208;responsive factors are composed of light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH. The relationship between luminescent property and stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is discussed in detail, and promising opportunities and existing challenges are presented as a guideline for future research in this area.







Abstract
Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.

         <title>An Increment System to Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in all&#8208;meta Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many chemical phenomena predictive models based on increment systems exist allowing an easy prediction. Despite its low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interaction are ubiquitous in manifold situation ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of different alkyl substituents ranging from Me, Et,  i  Pr up to  t  Bu. Based on this data we were able to implement an increment system for London dispersion for this azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation, which allows to predict the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in this arrangement which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by&#160;Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (  Frank et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a small amount of silicon to the known composition of RhP3 (centrosymmetric space group Im
) yields novel RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) which has a noncentrosymmetric, nonsymmorphic, and chiral crystal structure. We hypothesize that a combination of M&#8722;Tt and M&#8722;Pn bonding favors noncentrosymmetric structures. Therefore, by adding a &#8220;pinch&#8221; of tetrel to known centrosymmetric metal pnictide compositions, new noncentrosymmetric structures may be realized.







Abstract
Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is &#960;&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P. In situ studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.

         <title>Spin States, Bonding and Magnetism in Mixed&#8208;Valence Iron(0)&#8208;Iron(II) Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of metal&#8208;metal bonding between two different kinds of metal sites is essential for understanding these &#8220;xenophilic&#8221; complexes. We used M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analysis on a pair of related diiron complexes; they indicated that the bond order is roughly one&#8208;half. The best electronic structure description is LFeII&#8722;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.







Abstract
&#8220;Xenophilic&#8221; complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8722;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8722;Fp (LX = &#946;&#8208;aldiminate or &#946;&#8208;diketiminate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into Fe&#8722;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism, and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electrostatic interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8722; &#8220;metalloligand&#8221; as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.

The best electronic structure description is LFe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cp, in which the Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cp is low-spin iron(0) and acts as an X-type ligand toward the high-spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Xenophilic&#8221; complexes offer metal-metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal-metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8722;Fe bonds, L&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&#8722;Fp (L&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt; = &#946;-aldiminate or &#946;-diketiminate; Fp = Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cp), that offer insight into Fe&#8722;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism, and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8592;Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cp, in which the Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cp is low-spin iron(0) and acts as an X-type ligand toward the high-spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electrostatic interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three-coordinate high-spin iron(II) site has large zero-field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &#8220;metalloligand&#8221; as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction of pentacene with alkali metals ranging from Li to Cs readily affords the doubly&#8208;reduced anion that shows different binding preference for the lightest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners. DFT calculations provide full support for the X&#8208;ray crystallographic data by following changes in aromaticity and electronic structure of pentacene upon reduction.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8722;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;Butyric Acid Foldamers Terminated with Rhodium(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts</title>

Another twist: &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes have been shown to possess point, helical and axial chirality. Communication from chiral residues at the N&#8208;termini of these 1&#8197;nm long foldamers to rhodium(I) complexes at the C&#8208;termini led to unequal ratios of diastereoisomers, although this did not alter the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalyzed by these foldamers.







Abstract
To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesized and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 310 helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1&#8197;nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) possess evenly dispersed atomic active centers and well&#8208;defined coordination structure, which provide high enzyme catalytic activity, and clear experimental model for mechanism study. Hence, the enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches by utilizing tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme activities of SAzymes are revealed. And the corresponding therapeutic mechanisms are also analyzed.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100&#8201;% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a new discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.

         <title>Tuning Peptide Structure and Function through Fluorobenzene Stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free peptide stapling method based on SNAr reactions of fluorobenzene derivatives led to a library of constrained cyclic peptides with a controlled ortho, meta or para relationship between two cysteine residues. The method is compatible with solid&#8208;phase synthesis by which a single linear peptide can be cyclized with different degrees of constraint. New potent agonists of melanocortin receptors were synthesized by using this method, and the effect of the cyclization on the secondary structure was studied by NMR and CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed that enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with ortho, meta or para relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant differences in potency and efficacy demonstrate how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Leading to White Light Emission in Diphenylbenzofulvene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even though the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid&#8208;state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid&#8208;state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives DPBFMe and DPMF(Me)2 is deciphered.







Abstract
The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.&#8201;e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8722;A groups or energy transfer processes.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Stabilized Perfluorinated Palladium Cages Catalyze the Additive&#8208;Free Aerobic Oxidation of Aliphatic Alcohols to Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages have been synthesized and characterized with atomic resolution within the channels of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and used as catalysts during the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. These results illustrate a rare example of stable per&#8208;fluorinated cationic metal complex, with potential implications in the future design of catalytic organometallic complexes.







Abstract
Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8208;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8208;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd2+ to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O2 for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, orange red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are discussed in detail based on various molecular designs. The heteroaromatic&#8208;type emitters possessing high rigid core reveal better efficiency enhancement compared to low rigid cores. Moreover, this review focuses on how to achieve high color purity in orange red emitters while maintaining good OLED device performances.







Abstract
Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the case of orange red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange red TADF emitters. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30&#8201;%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra; therefore, more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, the recent progress of orange red TADF emitters based on molecular structures, such as cyanobenzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron&#8208;based acceptors, are reviewed. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized, Self&#8208;Assembling Small Interfering RNA&#8208;Prohead RNA Molecules Trigger Dicer&#8208;Independent Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules fusing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to prohead RNA (pRNA) three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) were designed. The siRNA&#8208;3WJs self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro. siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines triggered potent gene silencing. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ).







Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery in&#8197;vivo. An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway through Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer in&#8197;vitro. However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA&#8208;3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.

         <dc:description>
Nanoscale particles (NPs) are ubiquitous in our daily life, ranging from ambient particulate matter, microplastics to theranostic nanoparticles. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behaviors in biological tissues. Practical applications of LDI MSI for NPs have been verified in sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, drug release evaluation and surface chemical analysis. Here we summarized previous studies in anticipation of more innovations in this field.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photo&#8208;electrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of a p&#8211;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Improving your PECs: A Cu2O/CeO2 composite with a unique structure has been fabricated, in which a p&#8211;n heterojunction and a micro&#8208;mesocrystal (m&#8208;MC) structure work together. Under their synergistic effect, an optimal Cu2O/CeO2 photocathode provides a decisive pathway for the rapid separation and transfer of electron&#8211;holes, thereby facilitating the separation/transfer of carriers. As a result, the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 shows the best photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
Cu2O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, although serious electron&#8211;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement for PEC activity. In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the surface of Cu2O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu2O/CeO2 structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) work together. The optimum Cu2O/CeO2 composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu2O octahedra, which is better than most Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu2O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu2O/CeO2 structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Ullmann Coupling of Phenols and Aryl Halides: The Synergetic Effect Between Plasmonic Copper Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotubes from Various Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those directly derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the synergetic effect between Cu NPs and CNTs could efficiently promote Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers. This study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically sustainable process.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation with Thioglycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis is summarized in this review.







Abstract
Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.

Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (IF) with various alkali metals prepare the radical anion salts. The data about different structures, properties, and characterization was obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements, and physical property measurement system (PPMS). Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is regarded as a one&#8208;dimensional magnetic chain through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C interaction. Theoretical calculations and magnetic results showed that [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state. Compounds IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts: IF2.&#8722;Li+ possesses unique &#960;&#8208;stack structure with an interplanar separation less than 3.46&#8197;&#197;, making it a semiconductor (&#948;RT=1.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1). This work gives insights into multifunctional radical anions, and describes the design and development of different functional radicals.

         <title>Tunable Surface Electric Field of Electrocatalysts via Constructing Schottky Heterojunctions for Selective Conversion of Trash Ions to Treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new method is proposed to tune the surface electric field of electrocatalysts by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. The well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products.







Abstract
Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytic conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reactions. Here, we introduce a conceptually new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as NOx&#8722; reduction reactions.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Activation for Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the box: A highly efficient bioconjugation strategy is reported utilising Pd(II) complexes prepared via C&#8722;H activation, which enable selective S&#8208;arylation of cysteine. These C&#8722;H activation complexes were prepared using common Pd(II) sources and without the need for a glovebox. A wide substrate scope is enabled by in&#8197;situ generation of these complexes, which produce excellent conversions of a model tripeptide and are able to arylate surface cysteine on an intact protein.







Abstract
Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8722;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.

para&#8208;Alkynylated aromatic amines are obtained without the need to prefunctionalize the starting aniline by Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a nondirected para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkynylation of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with a variety of substituted anilines. The scalability and further derivatizations of the alkynylated products have been also demonstrated.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Crystallographic Characterization of the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent studies that have demonstrated the importance of R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds in synthesis, biology and medicine, these noncovalent interactions remain undercharacterized. Herein, we present crystallographic, computational and for the first time, spectroscopic evidence for these weak hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
As appreciation for nonclassical hydrogen bonds has progressively increased, so have efforts to characterize these interesting interactions. Whereas several kinds of C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds have been well&#8208;studied, much less is known about the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X variety. Herein, we present crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence for the existence of these interactions, with special relevance to Selectfluor chemistry. Of particular note is the propensity for Lewis bases to engage in nonclassical hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding with the electrophilic F atom of Selectfluor. Further, the first examples of 1H NMR experiments detailing R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=O, N) hydrogen bonds are described.

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enable the formation of asymmetric C&#8211;C bonds&#160; via &#160;the formation of an aryl&#8208;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without using a stoichiometric aryl&#8208;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8208;Me&#8208;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well&#8208;suited for DEL synthesis. Existing examples on micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse&#8208;tunable Red Luminescence and Electronic Properties of Nitridoberylloaluminates Sr2&#8208;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x = 0&#8722;2)</title>

         <dc:description>The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  and solid solutions Sr  2&#8722;  x  Ba  x  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  (  x  = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50 MPa N  2  atmosphere at 1200 &#176;C. Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  crystallizes in triclinic space group (no. 2) (  Z  = 2,  a  = 6.1869(10),  b  = 7.1736(13),  c  = 8.0391(14) &#197;,  &#945;  = 102.754(8),  &#946;  = 112.032(6),  &#947;  = 104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr:Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of  M  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ] (  M  = Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450 nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656 nm (fwhm = 1922&#8211; 2025 cm  &#8722;1  (72&#8211;87 nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr  2+  by larger Ba  2+  leads to an inversetunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low&#8208;temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.</dc:description>

Depending on the catalyst either none, one or two silyl groups migrate and change their positions in the formed five&#8208;membered rings. The optoelectronic properties are quite similar, whereas the packing motifs differ dramatically.

Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA Polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding  mth  N/  mth  NTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the  mth  N alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Hydroboration of Imines from Combined Computational and Experimental Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8208;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization processes.

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile&#8217;s polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going to plan: Olefins have been hydroxymethylated by using an iridium catalyst and the synergy of two ligands. DFT calculations provided a chance to develop new catalytic systems before empirical studies were undertaken. Then the iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroformylation/reduction of olefins to alcohols under water&#8211;gas shift reaction conditions was studied as an example. Two different ligands (L1 and L10) applied at the same time improved alcohol yields and verified the computational model.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on using two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activities for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. Whereas bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced that uses dual ligands in the whole domino process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.

         <title>Competition for Hydride Between Silicon and Boron: Synthesis and Characterization of a Hydroborane&#8208;Stabilized Silylium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylium against borenium&#8230;who wins when tugging on opposite &#8220;ends&#8221; of hydride? A cationic system based on a naphtalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform has been designed for probing the competition for hydride between silicon and boron. The hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion with a delocalized three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron B&#8722;H&#8722;Si bond and more silylium than borenium ion character is the winner (see Scheme; [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; omitted for clarity).







Abstract
Potent main&#8208;group Lewis acids are capable of activating element&#8208;hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium&#8208; and borenium&#8208;ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform was designed. Abstraction of one hydride leads to a hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion rather than a hydrosilane&#8208;coordinated borenium ion paired with [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or [HCB11Cl11]&#8722; as counteranions. Characterization by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction supported by DFT calculations reveals a cationic, unsymmetrical open three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (3c2e) Si&#8722;H&#8722;B linkage.

&lt;p&gt;Potent main-group Lewis acids are capable of activating element-hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium- and borenium-ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene-1,8-diyl platform was designed.

Definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity enable the regio&#8208;specific sulfonyl transfer reaction.







Abstract
Miniature models of acyl&#8208;transfer systems in cells, which were composed by replacing the protein, coenzyme, and substrate with CD, functional group, and CD, respectively, and combining them all together in one, displayed definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity, and thus enabled the regio&#8208;specific reaction.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Final act: While a &#8220;collective&#8221; total synthesis of complex macrolide antibiotics illustrates the power of catalysis, it also shows that the glycosylation of elaborate targets remains far from routine. The success critically hinged on the development of robust new approaches to the peripheral (di)deoxy sugars and the proper choice amongst a set of only seemingly equivalent promoters.







Abstract
The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.

         <title>Reaching New Biocatalytic Reactivity Using Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous flow is a mainstay in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. It has also begun to see increasing application in biocatalysis. This manuscript discusses some of the challenges that continuous flow has contributed solutions to for the improvement of biocatalysis. It also poses how the future of continuous flow biocatalysis will change with new technologies such as automation, in&#8208;line analysis and AI.







Abstract
The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI&#8208;assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me  2  daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me  2  daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me  2  daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me  2  daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this combined computational and experimental study, we performed studies on the C&#8208;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8208;H functionalization reaction. With these findings we were able to then quickly identify suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8208;H methylation reactions using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8208;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different size. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared via [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization  via  single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straight&#8208;forward manner. The  t&#8208;  Bu&#8208;ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions exhibiting one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube&#8208;direction known opening new avenues in crystal design of CPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamically favourable states in the reaction of nitrogenase without dissociation of any sulfide ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociate.

This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase.

         <title>Combined in silico and in vitro approaches to uncover the oxidation and Schiff base reaction of baicalein as an inhibitor of amyloid protein aggregation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidized form of&#160;baicalein&#160;(  BA  )&#160;leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper&#160;the aggregation&#160;and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of&#160;  BA  &#160;with pentylamine (  PA  ) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing&#160;the&#160;atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the tri&#8208;hydroxylated moiety of&#160;  BA  .&#160;Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches&#160;clearly&#160;indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation reaction with&#160;  PA  &#160;under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselective C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between&#160;  BA  &#160;and&#160;  PA  , followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; the&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product.&#160;These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of&#160;  BA  &#160;and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl&#8208;moiety as a pharmacophore for drug design studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Properties of the reactants and their interactions within and with the enzyme binding
cavity determine reaction selectivities. The case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent enzymes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, i.e. hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, i.e. substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme&#8217;s binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8211;H and P&#8211;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, we examined the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms. The unique features observed include (i) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8211;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene, (ii) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6&#160;(9) upon halide abstraction, (iii) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8211;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8211;C&#8211;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6&#160;(10) and (iv) an unprecedented C&#8211;P bond activation transforming the P&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer ligand of&#160;8&#160;in a C&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug&#8208;development. However, structure&#8208;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis.&#160; The oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition reaction can effectively generate a diverse array of 7&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis.&#160; Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. Antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8208;function insight relevant to their antiviral activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8722;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkynyl and allenyl electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and Isoquinolinium Salts via Exo and Endo Selective Cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Alkynyl)benzaldimines</title>

         <dc:description>Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines underwent exclusive 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form  N  &#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;  exo  into 6&#8208;  endo  cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving  N  &#8208;aryl or  N  &#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and the study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Moreover, reacting the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne could afford structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been also investigated.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Coinage metal-promoted 5-  exo  and 6-  endo  selective cyclization of 2-(1-alkynyl)benzaldimines have been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2-(1-alkynyl)benzaldimines underwent exclusive 5-  exo  -dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form  N  -aryl 3-methyleneisoindolin-1-ones.

         <title>Formation of supramolecular nanostructures via in situ self&#8208;assembly and post&#8208;assembly modification of a biocatalytically constructed dipeptide hydrazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe that the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an  N  &#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the  in situ  constructed supramolecular architectures tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>
