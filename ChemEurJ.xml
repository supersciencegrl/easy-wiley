         <title>Advancing Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1 h) and high yield (&gt;90%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates. Furthermore, the results highlight its potential for versatile applications across fundamental and translational biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations Of (Anti)Aromaticity In Oxidized And Reduced Porphyrin And Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18&#960; neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16&#960; neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16&#960; porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18&#960; dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved excited&#8208;state spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Ultrapotent Tricyclic Ligands for FK506&#8208;Binding proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to small, rigid, and sp3&#8208;rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506&#8208;binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate&#8208;mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely position functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14&#8208;step gram&#8208;scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and N&#8208;acyl iminium cyclization. Structure&#8208;based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Coordinated Phosphonate Group Directly Observed by 17O&#8208;NMR in Lanthanide(iii) Complexes of a Mono(ethyl phosphonate) DOTA Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamics of mutual exchange of coordinated and non&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms on phosphate anion analogue was measured for the first time. It proceeds through a sterically demanding four&#8208;membered &#954;2&#8208;O2P chelate. Its energy barrier steeply increases for smaller Ln(III) ions and is accessible only in more flexible TSA isomers of large Ln(III) ions.







Abstract
Biological phosphates can coordinate metal ions and their complexes are common in living systems. Dynamics of mutual oxygen atom exchange in the tetrahedral group in complexes has not been investigated. Here, we present a direct experimental proof of exchange (&#8220;phosphonate rotation&#8221;) in model Ln(III) complexes of monophosphonate H4dota analogue which alters phosphorus atom chirality of coordinated phosphonate monoester. Combination of macrocycle&#8208;based isomerism with P&#8208;based chirality leads to several diastereoisomers. (Non)&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms were distinguished through 17O&#8208;labelled phosphonate group and their mutual exchange was followed by various NMR techniques and DFT calculations. The process is sterically demanding and occurs through bulky bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;PO2)&#8722; coordination and was observed only in twisted&#8208;square antiprism (TSA) diastereoisomer of large Ln(III) ions. Its energy demands increase for smaller Ln(III) ions (298&#916;G&#8800;(exp./DFT)=51.8/52.1 and 61.0/71.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for La(III) and Eu(III), respectively). These results are helpful in design of such complexes as MRI CA and for protein paramagnetic NMR probes. It demonstrates usefulness of 17O NMR to study solution dynamics in complexes involving phosphorus acid derivatives and it may inspire use of this method to study dynamics of phosphoric acid derivatives (as e.&#8201;g. phosphorus acid&#8208;based inhibitors of metalloenzymes) in different areas of chemistry.

         <title>Phthalocyanines Synthesis: A State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Review of Sustainable Approaches Through Green Chemistry Metrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Driven by escalating environmental concerns, synthetic chemistry faces an urgent need for a green revolution. Green chemistry, with its focus on low environmental impacting chemicals and minimized waste production, emerges as a powerful tool in addressing this challenge. Metrics such as the E&#8208;factor guide the design of environmentally friendly strategies for chemical processes by quantifying the waste generated in obtaining target products, thus enabling interventions to minimize it. Phthalocyanines (Pcs), versatile molecules with exceptional physical and chemical properties, hold immense potential for technological applications. This review aims to bridge the gap between green chemistry and phthalocyanine synthesis by collecting the main examples of environmentally sustainable syntheses documented in the literature. The calculation of the E&#8208;factor of a selection of them provides insights on how crucial it is to evaluate a synthetic process in its entirety. This approach allows for a better evaluation of the actual sustainability of the phthalocyanine synthetic process and indicates possible strategies to improve it.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of carbon dioxide at the air&#8208;water interface and its chemical implications.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggests that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.</dc:description>

The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air-water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggests that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface-rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanisms of Mn(V)&#8208;Oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;Oxyl Conversion: From Closed&#8208;Cubane Photosystem II to Mn(V) Catalysts and the Role of the Entering Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex with a trigonal bipyramidal structure can change its identity to an Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl if it rearranges into a square pyramidal structure. An L ligand can trap the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl complex by coordinating to the square pyramidal structure, thereby making the resulting complex energetically more available to serve as a highly reactive catalyst in H2O oxidation and C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
The low activation barrier for O&#8722;O coupling in the closed&#8208;cubane Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 &#8242;dangler&#8242; ion in the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex into a more reactive Mn4(IV)&#8208;oxyl species, enhancing O&#8722;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind the coordination and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8722;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 dxy orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the dxy orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8722;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)&#8208;based catalysts. For other catalysts, ligands such as OH&#8722; stabilize the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl species better than water, improving catalyst activation for reactions like C&#8722;H bond activation. This study is the first to explain the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl conversion, providing a new foundation for Mn&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Post&#8208;formation of Fused Pentagonal Structure on Fjord Region of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum catalyzes the cleavage of two C&#8722;H bonds at the fjord position of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and the subsequent C&#8722;C bond formation gives a cyclopenta&#8208;PAH. This post&#8208;construction of the pentagonal structure is energetically challenging and requires high temperatures. With water as the medium, it has been found that the monocyclization selectively occurs at a lower temperature. Fe2O3 is effective in suppressing side reactions. We found this reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene in D2O. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsuji and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400987).

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature presents Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family, realizing its unique electronic structure. Theoretical investigations reveal the position of its anionic electron localized outside the molecular structure, adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H moieties. This special charge&#8208;separated configuration is facilitated by an electron transfer from lithium to a molecular orbital located at the back of the calix[3]pyrrole fragment. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Saha, B.&#8197;B. Skjelstad and S. Pan (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400448).

         <title>Precisely Designed Ultra&#8208;Small CoP Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Highly Efficient Host in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5 &#177; 2.6 nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1 &#177; 3.1 nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8208;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the &#960;&#8208;system of fatty acid&#8208;anion transporter conjugates modulates their mechanism of proton transport and mitochondrial uncoupling activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial uncoupling by small molecule protonophores is a promising strategy for developing novel anticancer agents. Recently, aryl urea substituted fatty acids (aryl ureas) were identified as a new class of protonophoric anticancer agents. To mediate proton transport these molecules self&#8208;assemble into membrane&#8208;permeable anionic dimers in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and aryl&#8208;urea anion receptor delocalise the negative charge across the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. In this work, we extend the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system by introducing a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and compare the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds to their monoaryl analogues. It was found that incorporation of meta&#8208;linked phenyl substituents into the aryl urea scaffold enhanced proton transport in vesicles and demonstrated superior capacity to depolarise mitochondria, inhibit ATP production and reduce the viability of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells. In contrast, diphenyl ureas linked through a 1,4&#8208;distribution across the phenyl ring displayed diminished proton transport activity, despite both diphenyl urea isomers possessing similar binding affinities for carboxylates. Mechanistic studies suggest that inclusion of a second aryl ring changes the proton transport mechanism, presumably due to steric factors that impose higher energy penalties for dimer formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Ethylcellulose Polymeric Films: Ag(I)&#8208;Based Components and Curcumin as Reinforcing Ingredients for Enhanced Food Packaging Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;active ethylcellulose (EC) polymeric films have been obtained by incorporating curcumin (curc) and Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds, known for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, respectively, within the polymeric matrix. The recently reported Ag(I) coordination polymer, in both its structural forms (&#945;&#8208;[(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; and &#946;&#8208;{[(bpy)Ag][OTf]}&#8734;), and the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc polymeric co&#8208;crystal (bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) have been selected as Ag(I) species. The hybrid composite films have been prepared through the simple solvent casting method and characterized through Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The deep investigation of the film samples highlighted the non&#8208;inert behaviour of EC towards these specific active ingredients. Antimicrobial tests showed that EC films embedding the Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds present good antimicrobial performance, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, used as a model of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In addition, Silver migration tests, performed on the Ag(I)&#8208;incorporating EC films, evidenced low values of silver release particularly in the case of the EC films incorporating [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational modeling approach is applied to rationalize the impact of streptavidin mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura synthesis of binaphthyls by means of an Artificial Metalloenzyme built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology. The integrative computational approach includes DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.

         <title>Asymmetric and Chemoselective Iridium Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Conjugated Unsaturated Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxime ethers is described. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded smoothly at (20&#8211;50&#8197;bar) room temperature. The generated chiral oxime ethers showed good isolated yields and excellent enantioselectivity (84&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, &gt;97&#8201;% ee). The hydrogenation products could be further hydrolysed to chiral ketones.







Abstract
Research on the chemoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of conjugated &#960;&#8208;systems has mostly been focussed on enones. Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P&#8208;iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;% ee). No hydrogenation of the C=N &#960;&#8208;bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20&#8197;bar H2, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.

         <title>Transition Behaviors of Isostructural Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Naphthalene, Quinoxaline, and Pyrazinopyrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural reticular frameworks with systematic differences on chemical structures allows us to disclose correlations between specific structural factors and properties, providing insights for designing novel porous materials. However, even slight differences in the molecular structure often result in formation of non&#8208;isostructural polymorphic frameworks particularly in the case of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) because the structures of HOFs are based on a subtle balance of reversible interactions. In this study, we found that three simple analogues of tetracarboxylic acids with naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores (NT, QX, and PP, respectively) yielded isostructural solvated HOFs (NT&#8208;1, QX&#8208;1, and PP&#8208;1, respectively), where hydrogen&#8208;bonded sql&#8208;networked sheets were slip&#8208;stacked with closely similar manners. These isostructural HOFs underwent structural transformations in different manners upon removal of the guest solvents. Comparison of the crystal structures of the HOFs before and after the transformation revealed that intermolecular interactions of the core significantly affected on rearrangements of hydrogen bonds in the transformation. The results suggest the potential to control the properties and functions of isostructural HOFs by elemental doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrophenol Reduction with Silver Oxide Nanostructures as a Sustainable Approach to Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose silver oxide as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for the catalytic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds.&#160; In the present investigation, we have adopted a facile and green synthetic route for the synthesis of silver oxide nanostructures. The prepared nanostructures were found to have crystallized in the cuprite phase and exhibited absorbance over the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The catalytic potential of the silver oxide was evaluated by following the kinetics of nitrophenol reduction under ambient conditions and is observed to follow pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant kapp = 4.24 x 10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 at minimum concentration of the catalyst. We attribute the observed catalytic activity to the freshly generated catalytic surface featuring a partially reduced form of silver oxide. The findings highlight the efficacy of silver oxide in mitigating the environmental pollution originating from the recalcitrant nitroarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway Selection in Temporal Evolution of Supramolecular Polymers of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Amphiphilic Organic Solvent Dictates the Fate of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AOS dictates aqueous: The temporal evolution of short supramolecular polymers (SPs) of ionic &#960;&#8208;systems into long SP networks in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixture follows two distinct pathways. The release or retaining water from ionic &#960;&#8208;systems is the key for pathway selection, and it is dictated by AOS.







Abstract
Understanding solvent&#8208;solute interactions is essential to designing and synthesising soft materials with tailor&#8208;made functions. Although the interaction of the solute with the solvent mixture is more complex than the single solvent medium, solvent mixtures are exciting to unfold several unforeseen phenomena in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report two unforeseen pathways observed during the hierarchical assembly of cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixtures. When the aqueous supramolecular polymers (SPs) of cPDIs are injected into AOS, initially kinetically trapped short SPs are formed, which gradually transform into thermodynamically stable high aspect ratio SP networks. Using various experimental and theoretical investigations, we found that this temporal evolution follows two distinct pathways depending on the nature of the water&#8208;AOS interactions. If the AOS is isopropanol (IPA), water is released from cPDIs into bulk IPA due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which further decreases the monomer concentration of cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;1). In the case of dioxane AOS, cPDI monomer concentration further increases as water is retained among cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;2) due to relatively weak interactions between dioxane and water. Interestingly, these two pathways are accelerated by external stimuli such as heat and mechanical agitation.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a spirosilabifluorene cyclic trimer have been successfully demonstrated. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were decreased through the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties were investigated from both experimental and theoretical points of view with careful discussion.







Abstract
A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (P,P,P)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed a high emission quantum yield (&#934;f=80&#8201;%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp=&#8722;1.2&#215;10&#8722;3). According to the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of &#964;f=1.89&#8197;ns.

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208;Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the role of exocyclic replacement of carbonyl oxygen of psoralen with sulfur and selenium. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies revealed a significant red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased oscillator strength, and spin&#8208;orbit coupling values, along with reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps in thio and seleno derivatives of psoralen. These factors led to efficient triplet harvesting, enabling them as promising photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8722;5&#8197;s for Pso to 10&#8722;8&#8197;s for TPso and 10&#8722;9&#8197;s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115&#8197;GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8211;1050&#8197;nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.

         <title>Control Over Anion Coordination on Pd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) with Regioisomeric Phosphine&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of regioisomeric carboxylate&#8208;phosphine ligands is shown to enable control over anion coordination on Pd(II) centers. Palladium(II) carboxylates are important for C&#8722;H activation and the complexes with specific orientations of the carboxylate anion or with a coordinated carboxylic acid group provide relevant coordination models. Additionally, the spatial anion control can be extended to other metal centers.







Abstract
The coordination of anionic donors is involved at various stages of catalytic cycles in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, but control over the spatial positioning of anions around a metal center is a challenge in coordination chemistry. Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;2, cis&#8208;&#954;1, or trans&#8208;&#954;1 coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal&#8208;alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation transition state for C&#8722;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.

Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine-carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal-alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation-deprotonation transition state for C&#8722;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl sulfones are crucial building blocks in synthetic chemistry and core structural units of pharmaceutically active molecules, thus extensive investigations have been conducted on the construction of these skeletons. In contrast to the classical synthetic approaches, the radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Radical sulfonation of alkynes typically begins with the sulfonyl radical attacking the alkynes, followed by further functionalization. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. However, there is no comprehensive review summarizing the advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation), along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linking Networks as Durable Bifunctional Coating for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serious dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross&#8208;linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross&#8208;linking, AT network coating is endowed with self&#8208;healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2/2 mAh cm&#8208;2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087 h at large charge/discharge depths of 10 mA cm&#8208;2/10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175 mAh g&#8208;1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Aerobic Upcycling of Polystyrene Plastics via Synergistic Indirect HAT Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution constitutes an evergrowing urgent environmental problem, since overaccumulation of plastic waste, arising from the immense increase of the production of disposable plastic products, overcame planet&#8217;s capacity to properly handle them. Chemical upcycling of polystyrene constitutes a convenient method for the conversion of plastic waste into high&#8208;added value chemicals, suggesting an attractive perspective in dealing with the environmental crisis. We demonstrate herein a novel, easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform organocatalytic photoinduced aerobic protocol, which proceeds via synergistic indirect hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis under LED 390 nm Kessil lamps as the irradiation source. The developed method employs a BrCH2CN&#8208;thioxanthone photocatalytic system and was successfully applied to a variety of everyday&#8208;life plastic products, leading to the isolation of benzoic acid after simple base&#8208;acid work up in yields varying from 23&#8208;49%, while a large&#8208;scale experiment was successfully performed, suggesting that the photocatalytic step is susceptible to industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoredox Thiol&#8208;yne Reaction for the Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Coumarins and its Effect on Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumarins still remain one of the most widely explored fluorescent dyes, with a broad spectrum of applications spanning various fields, such as molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, or medical sciences. Their fluorescence is strongly based on a push&#8208;pull mechanism involving an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), mainly located at the C7 or C8 positions of the dye core. Unfortunately, up to now, these positions have been very limited to hydroxyl or amino groups. In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol&#8211;yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium&#8208; or porphyrin&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late&#8208;stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in a single&#8208;step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;benzothiazole, 6&#8208;8&#8208;difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204 nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Fluorenyl&#8208;Based Copolyimines with Adjustable Mechanical Properties, Recyclability and Friction Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic polyimines are a class of fascinating dynamic polymers with recyclability and reparability owing to their reversible Schiff&#8208;base reactions. However, balancing the dynamic properties and mechanical strength of dynamic polyimines presents a major challenge due to the dissociative and associative nature of the imine bonds. Herein, we introduced bulky fluorene groups and polyether amine into the skeleton of polyimine networks to achieve a tradeoff in comprehensive properties. The resulting dynamic polyimines with fluorene groups (Cardo&#8208;DPIs) were successfully synthesized by combining the rigid diamine 9,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)fluorene and the flexible polyether amine, demonstrating a high tensile strength of 64.7 MPa. Additionally, Cardo&#8208;DPIs films with more content of rigid fluorene groups exhibited higher water resistance, glass transition temperature and wear&#8208;resisting ability. Moreover, the Cardo&#8208;DPIs films not only efficiently underwent thermal reshaping, but also exhibited excellent self&#8208;healing capabilities and chemical degradation in acidic solutions. Furthermore, the resulting films can achieve fully closed&#8208;loop recovery by free amine solution for 2 h at room temperature. This study broadens the scope of dynamic polyimine materials and promotes the balanced development of their functional and mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Sulfoximine Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An achiral Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/annulation of chiral sulfoximine&#8208;enabled thioamides with ynamides is presented herein. This method successfully synthesizes axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones with good enantiocontrol. Interestingly, the annulation with chiral oxazolidone&#8208;containing ynamides could provide a separable mixture of diastereomers (up to ~10:1 dr). Moreover, enantiopure sulfoximines could be recovered with ~99% purity, making this method practical. DFT studies show valuable insight into the mechanism and origin of asymmetric induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclopropanation of Active Methylene Derivatives Based on FeCl2 or FeCl3&#8208;Promoted Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bicyclic cyclopropanes were synthesized by two radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions based on the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization of active methylene derivatives and the redox radical cyclization of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes using the subcatalytic amount of FeCl2 and ligand.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were studied for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of active methylene derivatives. In the presence of FeCl3 as a stoichiometric oxidant and K2HPO4 as a base, the dehydrogenative cyclopropanation of active methylenes proceeded through the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization followed by the ionic cyclization to give the bicyclic cyclopropanes. The use of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes leads the subcatalytic cyclopropanation involving two redox pathways. In the presence of K2HPO4, the redox cyclopropanation proceeded by using FeCl2 (20&#8197;mol%) in combination with ligand (20&#8197;mol%).

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy and 2D materials: a perfect combination. Since graphene's SERS effect observation, 2D layered materials have been developed as active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This perspective highlights the key concepts behind SERS spectroscopy and provides new insights into a new research field that combines the design of SERS 2D substrates using Raman spectroscopy and imaging.







Abstract
The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.&#8201;g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites for Glioma Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanocomposites, camouflaged by cell membranes, exosomes or other bio&#8208;membranes, exhibit exceptional characteristics that facilitate efficient and precise delivery of contrast agents or drugs to glioma sites. These biomimetic nanocomposites are promising in glioma imaging and therapy, including fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multimodal imaging, as well as chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy.







Abstract
Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor, is highly invasive and grows rapidly. As such, the survival of glioma patients is relatively short, highlighting the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of glioma. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the non&#8208;targeting delivery systems of contrast agents and drugs greatly hinder the effective glioma imaging and therapy. Fortunately, in recent years, investigators have constructed various biomimetic delivery platforms utilizing the exceptional advantages of biomimetic nanocomposites, such as immune evasion, homologous targeting ability, and BBB penetrating ability, to achieve efficient and precise delivery of substances to glioma sites for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this concept, we present the application of these biomimetic nanocomposites in fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi&#8208;modal imaging, as well as in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy for glioma. Lastly, we provide our perspective on this research field.

         <title>Replacement of Toxic Hydrazines in Satellite Propulsion with Greener Dinitramide&#8208;Based Energetic Ionic Liquid Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine&#8208;free liquid ionic candidate formulations for satellite propulsion have been identified and prepared. They are based on the dinitramide anion, which is environmentally more benign. An initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides was first weened to 3 candidates, from which only one was retained that has acceptable sensitivities and melting point.







Abstract
Satellite propulsion uses liquid mono or bi&#8208;propellants composed of a hydrazine in combination with a strong oxidant. However, hydrazines are highly toxic. As a result, many research efforts for more environmentally compatible propellants have been made over the past decade. In this study we evidence green formulations that retain high propulsive performances. They are based on the dinitramide anion. From an initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides 3 best candidates were selected after evaluation of their potential syntheses, calculated theoretical performances, experimental synthesis optimizations and decomposition temperatures. These three salts were then formulated to obtain acceptable sensitivities and melting points, which eventually led to only one formulation being retained: a 40&#8201;:&#8201;60 mixture of dimethylammonium dinitramide and ammonium dinitramide phlegmatized by 10&#8201;% of glycerol.

         <title>Inducing &#945;&#8208;Helicity in Peptides by Silver Coordination to Cysteine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular switch based on metal complexation of peptides is here presented. The highly ordered dimeric &#945;&#8208;helical complexes are obtained by adding silver ions to specific peptide motifs containing two cysteine residues. The dynamic formation of these surprisingly stable complexes has been characterized by chromatographic, spectroscopic, potentiometric and mass spectrometric methods.







Abstract
Short peptide sequences consisting of two cysteine residues separated by three other amino acids display complete change from random coil to &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure in response to addition of Ag+ ions. The folded CXXXC/Ag+ complex involves formation of multinuclear Ag+ species and is stable in a wide pH range from below 3 to above 8. The complex is stable through reversed&#8208;phase HPLC separation as well as towards a physiological level of chloride ions, based on far&#8208;UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. In electrospray MS under acidic conditions a peptide dimer with four Ag+ ions bound was observed, and modelling based on potentiometric experiments supported this to be the dominating complex at neutral pH together with a peptide dimer with 3&#8197;Ag+ and one proton at lower pH. The complex was demonstrated to work as a N&#8208;terminal nucleation site for inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity into longer peptides. This type of silver&#8208;mediated peptide assembly and folding may be of more general use for stabilizing not only peptide folding but also for controlling oligomerization even under acidic conditions.

&lt;p&gt;A molecular switch based on metal complexation of peptides is here presented. The highly ordered dimeric &#945;-helical complexes are obtained by adding silver ions to specific peptide motifs containing two cysteine residues. The dynamic formation of these surprisingly stable complexes has been characterized by chromatographic, spectroscopic, potentiometric and mass spectrometric methods.

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) Solid Solutions for Improving Solar Fuels Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by H2O Vapour</title>

Herein, we present a molten&#8208;salt approach to synthesize Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions. Expand the light&#8208;harvesting wavelength range. Additionally, we found that with the introduction of ZnFe2O4, the photogenerated electrons transition from CoO4 tetrahedron to FeO6 octahedron, and the FeO6 octahedron becomes the photocatalytic reduction site. The introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Functional Plasticity of a Viral Terpene Synthase, OILTS, that Shows Non&#8211;Specific Metal Cofactor Binding and Metal&#8211;Dependent Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
OILTS, a terpene synthase found from a giant virus, exhibits high plasticity to metal cofactors. It can use even Zn2+ known to severely decrease the activities of many terpene synthases. In addition, when Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ were used as the cofactors, the profile of enzyme product was changed. The functional plasticity may benefit the virus in adapting to diverse environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.







Abstract
OILTS is a viral class I terpene synthase found from the giant virus Orpheovirus IHUMI&#8211;LCC2. It exhibits a unique structure and demonstrates high plasticity to metal cofactors, allowing it to biosynthesize different cyclic terpene frameworks. Notably, while OILTS produces only (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8211;4&#8211;ol with the most common cofactor, Mg2+, it also biosynthesizes a different cyclic terpene, (+)&#8208;cubebol, with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, presenting a rare instance of cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme catalysis. This is the first report of (+)&#8208;cubebol biosynthesis, to our knowledge. In addition, OILTS can uptake Zn2+ as a cofactor, which is uncommon among ordinary terpene synthases. These findings suggest that OILTS&#8242;s functional plasticity may benefit the virus in diverse host environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.

         <title>Utility of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate enables efficient chloride removal during sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride synthesis allowing the controlled amine&#8208;initiated ring opening polymerization. This approach can avoid sublimation or other intensive purification of NCAs and NNCAs easing the synthesis of polypeptides, polypeptoids, and polypeptp(o)ides.







Abstract
The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein's Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#8197;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8211;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.

New zinc sensor with 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety inspired by the green fluorescent protein chromophore was synthesized and characterized. The in&#8197;vitro validation of the novel probe with two&#8211;photon microscopy was carried out successfully.







Abstract
An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8211;photon microscopy and related biological application that features an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440&#8197;nm and 505&#8197;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8211;photon cross&#8211;section of 73&#8197;GM at 880&#8197;nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8211;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8211;bound compounds are presented.

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Driven Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex (EDA) complex&#8208;based method for trifluoromethylating heterocycles, bypassing traditional photocatalysts and oxidants. Utilizing 395&#8197;nm light, it efficiently produces trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. The research emphasizes EDA photoactivation&#8216;s crucial role, thoroughly documented through experimental, mechanistic, and spectroscopic analyses, thereby expanding EDA complexes&#8242; utility in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Heterocyclic trifluoromethylation is efficiently initiated through a photochemical reaction utilizing an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, proceeding smoothly without the use of photocatalysts, transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or additional oxidants. This method has been optimized through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its versatility and efficacy across various substrates, including quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. Notably, this approach enables the practical synthesis of trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations that incorporate radical trapping and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of the an EDA complex and elucidated the reaction pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of EDA photoactivation in trifluoromethylation, significantly expanding the application scope of EDA complexes in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Construction of Ultrafine PtIr Clusters Supported on Co3O4 Nanoflowers for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fabricating the combination of ultrafine PtIr nanoclusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires, the as&#8208;obtained PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 hybrid catalysts exhibit OER/HER and overall water splitting performances superior to the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts, owing to the heterogeneous structure, ultrafine metal clusters and strong interaction between noble metal and transition metal species.







Abstract
Green hydrogen production through electrochemical overall water splitting has suffered from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, inferior conversion efficiency, and high cost. Herein, ultrafine PtIr clusters are synthesized via an electrodeposition method and decorated on the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires (PtIr&#8208;Co3O4). The encouraging performances in electrochemical OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are achieved over the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst, with the overpotentials as low as 410 and 237&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Due to the ultralow loading of PtIr clusters, the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst exhibits 1270&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 for OER at the overpotential of 400&#8197;mV. Our detailed analyses also show that the strong interactions between the ultrafine PtIr clusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers enable the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting at the potential of 1.57&#8197;V, accompanied by high durability for 100&#8197;h.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Complexation with Fe(0) of a Tight&#8208;bite Bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the unique reactions of a tight&#8208;bite bis(NHSi) with p&#8208;toluidine and Fe(CO)5. With p&#8208;toluidine, it resulted in the oxidative addition of both N&#8722;H bonds across two Si(II) atoms to afford cyclodisilazane, whereas with Fe(CO)5 a four&#8208;membered NSi2Fe2 ring with a Fe&#8722;Fe bond of 2.6892(13) &#197; is formed.







Abstract
The synthesis, reactivity, and complexation with Fe(0) precursor of a tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) (bis(NHSi)) ligand 1 are reported. The reaction of 1 with p&#8208;toluidine led to the activation of both N&#8722;H bonds across Si(II) atoms to afford a four&#8208;membered heterocyclic cyclodisilazane 2, with hydride substituents attached to five&#8208;coordinate Si atoms. A 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 reaction of 1 with Fe(CO)5 led to an intriguing dinuclear complex 3 featuring a five&#8208;membered (N&#8722;Si&#8722;Fe&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si) ring with a Fe&#8722;Fe bond distance of 2.6892(13) &#197;. All compounds (1&#8208;3) were thoroughly characterized by various spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies conclusively established their molecular structures. DFT calculations were carried out to shed light on bonding and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;3.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Promoted Polyhexagonal Saddle&#8208;Shaped Molecular Structures and their Supramolecular Coassembly with C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined effect of sulphur&#8208;induced curvature and unification of aryl groups through borylation furnishes a potential saddle&#8208;shaped architecture to the polyaromatics 1 and 2 without introducing any heptagon. Heterocycle 1, with smaller concave&#8208;convex molecular surfaces, forms a superstructure with double columnar fullerenes C60 in the solid state.







Abstract
Molecules with curved architecture can exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to the concave&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;surface. However, synthesizing negatively curved saddle&#8208;shaped aromatic systems has been challenging due to the internal structural strain. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of two polyhexagonal molecular systems, 1 and 2, with saddle shape geometry by judiciously varying the aromatic moiety, avoiding the harsh synthetic methods as that of heptagonal aromatic saddle systems. The unique geometry preferences of B, N, and S furnish suitable curvature to the molecules, featuring saddle shape. The saddle geometry also enables them to interact with fullerene C60, and the supramolecular interactions of fullerene C60 with 1 and 2 modify their optoelectronic properties. Crystal structure analysis reveals that 1, with a small &#960;&#8208;surface, forms a double columnar array of fullerenes in the solid state.

     alt="Heteroatom-Promoted Polyhexagonal Saddle-Shaped Molecular Structures and their Supramolecular Coassembly with C60"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined effect of sulphur-induced curvature and unification of aryl groups through borylation furnishes a potential saddle-shaped architecture to the polyaromatics &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; without introducing any heptagon. Heterocycle &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, with smaller concave-convex molecular surfaces, forms a superstructure with double columnar fullerenes &lt;b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; in the solid state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecules with curved architecture can exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to the concave-convex &#960;-surface. However, synthesizing negatively curved saddle-shaped aromatic systems has been challenging due to the internal structural strain. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of two polyhexagonal molecular systems, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, with saddle shape geometry by judiciously varying the aromatic moiety, avoiding the harsh synthetic methods as that of heptagonal aromatic saddle systems. The unique geometry preferences of B, N, and S furnish suitable curvature to the molecules, featuring saddle shape. The saddle geometry also enables them to interact with fullerene &lt;b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; and the supramolecular interactions of fullerene &lt;b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; modify their optoelectronic properties. Crystal structure analysis reveals that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, with a small &#960;-surface, forms a double columnar array of fullerenes in the solid state. In contrast, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with a large &#960;-surface produces a supramolecular capsule entrapping two discrete fullerenes. The intermolecular interactions between B, N, S, and the aryl-&#960; surface of the host and &lt;b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; guest are the stabilizing factors for creating these supramolecular structures. Comprehensive computational, optical, and Raman spectroscopic studies establish the charge transfer interactions between B&#8722;N doped heterocycle host and fullerene &lt;b&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; guest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocontrolled Binding of Styrylnaphthyridine Ligands to Abasic Site&#8208;Containing DNA by Reversible [2+2] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrylnaphthyridine derivatives are shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA). The ligand can be formed from its photodimer in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a promising tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder.







Abstract
Five novel styrylnaphthyridine derivatives were synthesized and shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA), which is an important therapeutic and diagnostic target. These compounds associate with AP&#8208;DNA with binding constants of 0.5&#8211;8.4&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 as shown by photometric and fluorimetric titrations. Specifically, these ligands bind preferentially to AP&#8208;DNA relative to regularly paired duplex DNA. As a special feature, the association of these ligands with DNA can be controlled by means of a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition. Upon irradiation at 420&#8197;nm the photodimer is formed, which does not bind to AP&#8208;DNA. In turn, the naphthyridine is regained with excitation at 315&#8197;nm. Most notably, this photoinduced deactivation and release of the DNA ligand can be performed in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder. Overall, these results provide a promising starting point for the development of functional AP&#8208;DNA ligands whose bioactivity can be modulated by light with local and temporal control.

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer potential for photodegradation of organic dyes in new perfluorinated Ce&#8208;MOFs.







Abstract
Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure. We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8211;3.1&#8197;eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.

         <title>Formation of Peroxynitrite, [O&#8722;N&#8722;O&#8722;O]&#8722;, via a Cascade of Reactions between Ozonide and Ammonia</title>

[ONOO]&#8722; has been encountered along a cascade of reactions between KO3 and ammonia in the presents of a partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based cation. For the first time, high resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite ion have been obtained and single crystals were studied by Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report on an unexpected reaction between ammonia and potassium ozonide dissolved in liq. NH3 resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite, [ONOO]&#8722;, which exclusively happens in the presence of a specific partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based ammonium cation. High&#8208;resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite anion in cis&#8208;conformation have been obtained. We further studied this molecule anion by single crystal Raman spectroscopy. The cis and trans isomers of peroxynitrite were analysed computationally with respect to their relative energies, the cis&#8208;trans transition barrier and their decomposition pathways to the nitrate anion. By experimentally examining cations decorated with fluorine ligands to different degrees, we demonstrate that fluorine specific interactions play a crucial role in the unexpected formation of peroxynitrite and as a conspicuously structure directing factor for the underlying crystalline solid phases, exhibiting distinct micro&#8208;separations of fluorine and hydrogen enriched regions.

Vinylarenes as synthetic linchpins towards the pyridine and 3D fragments conjugation enabled by metal free photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is described, which exhibit broad substrate scope, mild conditions, and excellent regioselectivity. This reaction tolerates late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules.







Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules. Initial mechanism studies and control experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions

         <title>Sequential, Electrochemical&#8208;Photochemical Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazines</title>

The electrochemical coupling of tetrazole species with 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine, followed by UV cyclization has resulted in an effective means for the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine was prepared via a two&#8208;step electrochemical, photochemical process. First, a 5&#8208;substituted tetrazole is electrochemically coupled to 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine to yield 1,5&#8208; and 2,5&#8208; disubstituted tetrazoles. Subsequent photochemical excitation of the 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole species using an ultraviolet lamp releases nitrogen gas and produces a short&#8208;lived nitrilimine intermediate. Subsequent cyclization of the nitrilimine intermediate yields a 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine backbone. The scope of this reaction was explored using various tetrazoles and pyrazines. Materials produced were identified using chemical analytical techniques and computationally studied for potential application as an insensitive energetic material.

         <title>Conformational and Electronic Variations in 1,2&#8208; and 1,5a&#8208;Cyclophellitols and their Impact on Retaining &#945;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibition</title>

Twenty configurational and functional cyclophellitol analogues were synthesized and evaluated on their potency as retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors. The inhibitory properties of the focused library of compounds were determined on human &#945;&#8208;glucosidases after which we mapped the conformational free energy landscapes of the most active compounds. Our results add to the growing list of covalent and competitive &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors and may pave the way towards the design of new therapeutics targeting these enzymes.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (glycosidases) take part in myriad biological processes and are important therapeutic targets. Competitive and mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors are useful tools to dissect their biological role and comprise a good starting point for drug discovery. The natural product, cyclophellitol, a mechanism&#8208;based, covalent and irreversible retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor has inspired the design of diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosidase inhibitor and activity&#8208;based probe scaffolds. Here, we sought to deepen our understanding of the structural and functional requirements of cyclophellitol&#8208;type compounds for effective human &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition. We synthesized a comprehensive set of &#945;&#8208;configured 1,2&#8208; and 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitol analogues bearing a variety of electrophilic traps. The inhibitory potency of these compounds was assessed towards both lysosomal and ER retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidases. These studies revealed the 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitols to be the most potent retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors, with the nature of the electrophile determining inhibitory mode of action (covalent or non&#8208;covalent). DFT calculations support the ability of the 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitols, but not the 1,2&#8208;congeners, to adopt conformations that mimic either the Michaelis complex or transition state of &#945;&#8208;glucosidases.

         <title>Ferromagnetically Coupled Chromium(III) Dimer Shows Luminescence and Sensitizes Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridentate chelate ligand allows both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III) via controlled synthesis, giving either a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex. Both complexes show room&#8208;temperature luminescence in solution with sub&#8208;microsecond lifetimes, short enough to avoid quenching by air oxygen, but sufficiently long for energy transfer to a triplet annihilator.







Abstract
There has been much progress on mononuclear chromium(III) complexes featuring luminescence and photoredox activity, but dinuclear chromium(III) complexes have remained underexplored in these contexts until now. We identified a tridentate chelate ligand able to accommodate both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III), to either access a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex depending on reaction conditions. This chelate ligand causes tetragonally distorted primary coordination spheres around chromium(III) in both complexes, entailing comparatively short excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the range of 400 to 800&#8197;ns in solution at room temperature and making photoluminescence essentially oxygen insensitive. The two chromium(III) ions in the dimer experience ferromagnetic exchange interactions that result in a high spin (S=3) ground state with a coupling constant of +9.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photoinduced energy transfer from the luminescent ferromagnetically coupled dimer to an anthracene derivative results in sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. Based on these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, dinuclear chromium(III) complexes seem attractive for the development of fundamentally new types of photophysics and photochemistry enabled by magnetic exchange interactions.

         <title>Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) Sialosides Containing NeuAc and NeuGc by Using Double Carbonyl&#8208;Protected N&#8208;Acyl Sialyl Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl and N&#8208;glycoyl sialyl donors underwent efficient &#945;(2,8) sialylation in dichloromethane, allowing for the chemical synthesis of &#945;(2,8) disialosides involving the compounds containing both NeuAc and NeuGc. The selective ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;glycolylcarbamate in these sialosides without losing the N&#8208;glycolyl group was accomplished under a lower reaction temperature than that required for N&#8208;acetyl carbamate.







Abstract
We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc&#8208;containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl sialyl donors. The 7&#8208;O,9&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl protection of an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;5&#8208;N,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;protected sialyl donor markedly increased the &#945;&#8208;selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N&#8208;acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N&#8208;acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N&#8208;glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N&#8208;acetyl carbamate due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxygen in the N&#8208;acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N&#8208;glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C&#8208;6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3&#8208;diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in Vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction between quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates, styryl dye libraries were successfully generated under mild conditions, and their optical properties information was simultaneously obtained. This powerful strategy, which is applicable both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells, enables the rapid discovery of styryl dyes with desirable characteristics that may find a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in&#8197;situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.

         <title>Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl Dimers as New Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomers of the title biaryl with one chiral axis and two helical moieties were resolved by chiral HPLC. Their chiroptical activities were evaluated by dissymmetry factors of the CD and CPL spectra. A stepwise mechanism of enantiomerization via rotation about the chiral axis was proposed by the DFT calculations.







Abstract
Dimers of anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl units and its mesityl derivative were synthesized by Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the corresponding chloro derivatives as new biaryls. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed that two polycyclic aromatic units with nonplanar deformations took a twisted conformation about the single bond as a chiral axis. Enantiomers of the nonsubstituted compound were resolved by chiral HPLC, and the enantiopure samples showed intense Cotton effects at 321&#8197;nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and emission bands at 449&#8197;nm in the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra with dissymmetry factor of |glum| 3.6&#215;10&#8722;3. The absolute stereochemistry of this biaryl was determined by the theoretical calculation of CD spectrum by the time&#8208;dependent DFT method. The barrier to enantiomerization was determined to be 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K. The dynamic process proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving the helical inversion of each aromatic unit and the rotation about the biaryl axis as analyzed by the DFT calculations.

         <title>Phosphoramide&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Effective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphoramide&#8208;based tri&#8208; and hexacarboxylic acids L1 and L2 have been used as ligands for metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Whereas Zn&#8722;L1 and Cu&#8722;L1, with pseudo&#8208;3D network structures with strong hydrogen bonds between 2D layers, show high thermal stability and porosity, Zn&#8722;L2, with a typical 3D network structure, exhibits high stability and excellent gas&#8208;adsorption properties for H2, CO2, and CH4 without open metal sites.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective and facile synthetic routes to organic ligands, along with porous materials that exhibit exceptional gas&#8208;storage properties, promise significant industrial applications. Here, a two&#8208;step synthesis of novel organophosphorus ligands without metal catalysts is reported. These ligands serve as versatile linkers for the construction of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating various metal ions, including zinc and copper. One of the zinc&#8208;based MOFs demonstrates remarkable gas&#8208;storage properties, with a hydrogen (H2) capacity exceeding 2.5&#8197;wt% at 77&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa as well as a carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity exceeding 20&#8197;wt% at 298&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa. Furthermore, this zinc&#8208;based MOF can be synthesized through a solvothermal process on the gram scale that yields high&#8208;quality single crystals.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Grown on the Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide to Realize High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Glucose Sensing</title>

To improve glucose detection, a series of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide, HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) are successfully synthesized. We explored the dosage and the synergistic effect of bimetals on the grown of nanomaterials as well as the electrochemical sensing performance. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.







Abstract
Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are provided with high specific surface area and redox activity that are widely used in electrochemistry. Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) perfectly combine the structural controllability of organic materials with the long&#8208;range ordering of inorganic materials that possess the characteristic of high electron mobility. Based on the above considerations, the combination of Ni(OH)2 and Ni&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) as an electrode modification material is designed to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, to improve glucose detection, a sequence of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide) are successfully synthesised by doping metals into Ni&#8208;HHTP and Ni(OH)2, respectively. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ether naphthotube was able to complex strongly with organic dications in organic solution to give an association constant up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. Thermodynamically, the host&#8208;guest interactions are exclusively enthalpically driven and enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation phenomena have been observed. Besides, a linear free energy correlation was observed between binding strengths and the Hammett substituent constants. The host&#8208;guest system can be directly applied for the preparation of more complex interlocked molecules by simple stoppering.







Abstract
The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host&#8208;guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 102 to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1, which were confirmed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectra and ITC experiments. The host&#8208;guest interactions are driven by enthalpy change as the entropic factors are unfavorable. Positive correlations between &#916;H and &#916;S have been observed in the host&#8208;guest complexes. Furthermore, the para&#8208;substitution of the guests can significantly affect the binding affinities through a combination of field/inductive and resonance effects by following a linear free energy relationship. Based on the host&#8208;guest complexes composed of ether naphthotube and organic cations, two interlocked [2]rotaxanes were prepared by cationization reaction and Huisgen cycloaddition between the cations and the stopper components. The ether naphthotube&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes are useful for creating sophisticated interlocked molecules.

         <title>A Family of Hexacopper Phenylsilsesquioxane/Acetate Complexes: Synthesis, Solvent&#8208;Controlled Cage Structures, and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexacopper phenylsilsesquioxane/acetate complex exhibits high catalytic activity in (i) oxygenations of hydrocarbons, (ii) Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, and (iii) tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction, leading to lactone directly from cyclohexane







Abstract
Convenient self&#8208;assembly synthesis of copper(II) complexes via double (phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate) ligation allows to isolate a family of impressive sandwich&#8208;like cage compounds. An intriguing feature of these complexes is the difference in the structure of a pair of silsesquioxane ligands despite identical (Cu6) nuclearity and number (four) of acetate fragments. Formation of particular combination of silsesquioxane ligands (cyclic/cyclic vs condensed/condensed vs cyclic/condensed) was found to be dependent on the synthesis/crystallization media. A combination of Si4&#8208;cyclic and Si6&#8208;condensed silsesquioxane ligands is a brand new feature of cage metallasilsesquioxanes. A representative Cu6&#8208;complex (4) (with cyclic silsesquioxanes) exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. Maximum yield of the products of cyclohexane oxidation attained 30&#8201;%. The compound 4 was also tested as catalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone by m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid: maximum yields of 88&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% of &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone were achieved upon conventional heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h and MW irradiation at 70 or 80&#8201;&#176;C during 30&#8197;min, respectively. It was also possible to obtain the lactone (up to 16&#8201;% yield) directly from the cyclohexane via a tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction using the same oxidant.

A novel fluorescent probe for visualizing Zn2+ in biological samples through microscopy has been designed. The probe was inspired by the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein, which was extended with an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline ionophore. A probe&#8211;Zn2+ complex is shown glowing green inside a cell, lighting up the scene and illustrating how the sensor indicates the presence of the ion.

         <title>Cover Feature: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Complexation with Fe(0) of a Tight&#8208;bite Bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) (Chem. Eur. J. 31/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) is involved in two distinct reactions. The first reaction, featuring the organic aniline p&#8208;toluidine, forms cyclodisilazane through the oxidative addition of both N&#8722;H bonds across two SiII atoms. Conversely, reaction with Fe(CO)5 yields a four&#8208;membered NSi2Fe2 ring featuring a Fe&#8722;Fe bond length of 2.6892(13)&#8197;&#197;. This investigation sheds light on the diverse reactivity of bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) compounds, providing valuable insights into their potential applications in main&#8208;group chemistry. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Stalke, H.&#8197;W. Roesky and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400389).

Photoinduced Generation of Aryl Radical and Applications: Generation of aryl radicals under photosensitized, photoinitiated, and direct or indirect photoredox&#8208;catalyzed conditions are reviewed. The utilization of aryl radicals in various reactions is demonstrated with examples.







Abstract
Photoinduced aryl radical generation is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis that facilitates the formation of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The synthetic applications of photoinduced aryl radical formation in the synthesis of complex organic compounds, including natural products, physiologically significant molecules, and functional materials, have received immense attention. An overview of current developments in photoinduced aryl radical production methods and their uses in organic synthesis is given in this article. A generalized idea of how to choose the reagents and approach for the generation of aryl radicals is described, along with photoinduced techniques and associated mechanistic insights. Overall, this article offers a critical assessment of the mechanistic results as well as the selection of reaction parameters for specific reagents in the context of radical cascades, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, aryl radical functionalization, and selective C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl substrates.

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Encapsulated Materials for Biological Cascade Chemistry and Synergistic Tumor Starvation</title>

Framework and polymeric nanoreactor have been regarded for improving cascade chemical reaction in the tumor microenvironment. Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzymes have been activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. In this review, we identify the significance of dual&#8208;enzyme cascade in the tumor microenvironment which regulated by ROS activity. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, ROS formation, including cascaded enzymes along with synergistic therapy.







Abstract
Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.

Different approaches to attain 2D supramolecular polymers, following both a thermodynamic or a kinetic regime, are reviewed. The examples of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies and showing elegant applications.







Abstract
Different approaches to achieve 2D supramolecular polymers, as an alternative to the covalent bottom&#8208;up approaches reported for the preparation of 2D materials, are reviewed. The significance of the operation of weak non&#8208;covalent forces to induce a lateral growth of a number of self&#8208;assembling units is collected. The examples of both thermodynamically and kinetically controlled formation of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies (nanosheets, scrolls, porous surfaces) and showing elegant applications like chiral recognition, enantioselective uptake or asymmetric organic transformations. Furthermore, elaborated techniques like seeded or living supramolecular polymerizations have been demonstrated to give rise to complex 2D nanostructures.

         <title>CO2 Photoreduction over Semiconducting 2D Materials with Supported Single Atoms: Recent Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting 2D materials with supported single atoms combine the advantages of 2D structures with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offering increased light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transfer, electron localization at active sites, improved reactant adsorption and activation, etc. This review highlights their significant potential and recent advancements in CO2 photoreduction, while also identifying key challenges and delineating future research directions.







Abstract
In the face of the growing energy crisis and environmental challenges, substantial efforts are now directed toward sustainable clean energy as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels. CO2 photoreduction into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is widely recognized as a promising approach to mitigate current energy and environmental concerns. Photocatalysts comprising single atoms (SAs) supported on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials (SAs&#8208;2DSemi) have emerged as a novel frontier due to the combined merits of SA catalysts and 2D materials. In this study, we review advancements in metal SAs confined on 2DSemi substrates, categorized into four groups: (1) metal oxide&#8208;based, (2) g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based, (3) emerging, and (4) hybridized 2DSemi, for photocatalytic CO2 conversion over the past few years. With a particular focus on highlighting the distinct advantages of SAs&#8208;2DSemi, we delve into the synthesis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, their catalytic performances, and mechanistic elucidation facilitated by experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Following this, we outline the challenges in this field and offer perspectives on harnessing the potential of SAs&#8208;2DSemi as promising photocatalysts. This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for the future development of 2D photocatalytic materials involving SAs for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Structural Chemistry of Titanium (IV) Oxo Clusters, Part 2: Clusters without Carboxylate or Phosphonate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 31, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review completes a series of three articles which provide a comprehensive coverage of the structural chemistry of polynuclear titanium oxo compounds. The interplay of structure&#8208;influencing coordination characteristics of the ligands and preferred arrangement of the Ti/O polyhedra in the cluster cores is worked out.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters (TOC) are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. In a previous article, TOC structures with carboxylato and phosphonato ligands were reviewed and categorized. This work is now extended to clusters with other ligands. Comparison of the different cluster types shows how the interplay between condensation of the titanium polyhedra by means of bridging oxygen atoms and the coordination characteristics of the ligands influences the cluster structures and allows working out basic construction principles of the cluster core.

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged units with special electronic effect are introduced to the TTM unit to construct stable luminescent radicals (BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM). NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm, while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm (100&#8197;meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm (130&#8197;meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.

         <title>Tandem Four&#8208;Component Reaction to Access Fused Polycycles Exhibiting Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of fused polycyclic compounds were synthesized efficiently through tandem four&#8208;component reactions that incorporated a chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based dicarbaldehyde, malonitrile and two carbonyl acetonitriles. Notably, Aggregation&#8208;enhanced through&#8208;space charge transfer emission could be observed based on the polycyclic spacer. Theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication.







Abstract
Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine&#8208;promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face&#8208;to&#8208;face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis. This work not only provides guidance for the one&#8208;step synthesis of complex polycycles, but also offers valuable insights into the design of aggregation&#8208;enhanced TSCT emission materials.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Alkylated Terrylenes and Ternaphthalenes Building&#8208;Blocks Towards Multi&#8208;Edge Nanographenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic route has been developed to produce highly soluble peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its derivatives with enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation at bay&#8208;regions. The synthesized terrylene derivatives exhibit remarkably high fluorescence quantum yields and molar extinction coefficients, making them ideal candidates for applications in single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy, photonics, and quantum emission.







Abstract
Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8211; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene's peri&#8208;positions &#8211; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene's chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization along with transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.

         <title>Solution&#8208;State Structure of a Long&#8208;Loop G&#8208;Quadruplex Formed Within Promoters of Plasmodium falciparum B var Genes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2]. The G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal 10&#8208;nt loop shows a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;standard hydrogen bonding. In addition to the 12&#8197;guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in the loop regions are well defined and involved in the interactions.







Abstract
We report the high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal loop of ten nucleotides. The G&#8208;quadruplex is formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2], named UpsB&#8208;Q&#8208;1. This sequence is found within promoters of the var genes of Plasmodium falciparum, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North&#8208;South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G&#8208;quartet&#8208;loop interfaces.

The G-quadruplex is formed by a 34-nt DNA sequence, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;[CAG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TATA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], named UpsB-Q-1. This sequence is found within promoters of the &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; genes of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]-hybrid G-quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non-canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North-South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G-quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G-quartet-loop interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs.







Abstract
It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.

         <title>Unique Reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;Bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene Moiety: Application to the Synthesis of 7&#8208;Norbornanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons of 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadienes prepared from 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanediones exhibit unique reactivities. Despite being sterically hindered, one of these carbons attacks on the carbocation generated at the &#948;&#8208;position to form a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Subsequent skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core produces the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one.







Abstract
We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones by exploiting the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated by the silylation of a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing a picolinoyloxy group at the 2&#8242; position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. The release of the acyloxy group during the reaction generates carbocations that are then attacked by silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety skeleton, forming a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core results in the formation of the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one. This novel transformation of 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moieties can be used to synthesise other cyclopentenone&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks.

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 was synthesized using the ammonothermal synthesis. Analysis of the compound is performed using X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. The characterization of the imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, only the second representative of this compound class, as possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates helps to improve the understanding for the ammonothermal synthesis of nitrides.







Abstract
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870&#8197;K and 230&#8197;MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a=10.9422(4)&#8197;&#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of such intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.

         <title>Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates an activated carboxylic acid (ACA) pushing a swing in order to populate the high&#8208;energy state associated with the aromatic imine laid on the swing seat. The energy derived from the decarboxylation of the ACA is partially diverted into the imine dynamic library that is temporarily brought into an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state in which an aromatic imine prevails over an aliphatic imine. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Valentini, G. Ercolani, and S. Di&#8197;Stephano (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401104).

         <title>Opportunities of MXenes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: V2C as Aerobic Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes, 2D nanomaterials constituted by alternating stacking of transition metal and carbide layers, drawn here as the fronds of a palm tree, are proposed as heterogeneous catalysts in the Concept by A. Dhakshinamoorthy, R. Ram&#237;rez&#8208;Grau, H. Garcia and A. Primo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400576). MXenes convert indane molecules, represented as birds flying to the tree, into indanol and indanone products that are hanging on the tree as fruits. The sea and the beach highlight that the process is environmentally benign.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Oxygenative Rearrangement of Tetrahydrocarbazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a general copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the tunable oxygenative rearrangement of tetrahydrocarbazoles to cyclopentyl&#8208;bearing spiroindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and spiroindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The method demonstrates excellent chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and product control simply by using the H2O and O2 as oxygen source, respectively. This open&#8208;flask method is safe and simple to operate, and no other chemical oxidants are required. Besides, inspired from the unique pathway of 1, 2&#8208;migration rearrangement, a highly controllable hydroxylation of indoles for the construction of C3a&#8208;hydroxyl iminium indolines was also developed. Mechanistic experiments suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;induced oxidation process is responsible for the tunable selectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Photoswitches with Enhanced Solar Spectrum Match</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report monomeric and dimeric norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane molecular photoswitch systems intended for molecular solar thermal applications. A series of six new norbornadiene derivatives conjugated with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and dithiafulvene as the donor unit were synthesized and fully characterized. The photoswitches were evaluated by experimentally and theoretically measuring optical absorption profiles and thermal conversion of quadricyclane to norbornadiene. Computational insight by density functional theory calculations at the M06&#8208;2X/def2&#8208;SVPD level of theory provided geometries, storage energies, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra and HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels, that are used to describe the function of the molecular systems. The studied molecules exhibit absorption onset ranging from 416 nm to 595 nm due to a systemic change in their donor&#8208;acceptor character. This approach was advantageous due to the introduction of benzothiadiazole and the dimeric nature of molecular structures. The best&#8208;performing system has a half&#8208;life of 3 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis by 21&#8208;Thiaporphyrins: A green and Efficient Approach for C&#8208;N Borylation and C&#8208;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic C&#8208;N borylation and C&#8208;H arylation&#160;mostly depend on the ruthenium and iridium complexes or eosin Y and the use of porphyrin catalysts is still in infancy. A series of novel 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins (A2B2 and A3B type) were synthesized having carbazole/phenothiazine moieties at their meso&#8208;positions and screened as catalysts for C&#8208;N borylation and C&#8208;H arylation. This paper demonstrates the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyzed C&#8208;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1 mol% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C&#8208;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation reactions. A variety of substituted anilines were used as source for expensive and unstable aryl diazonium salts in the reactions. The heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters were obtained in decent yields (up to 88%). Versatility of the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst was tested by thiolation and selenylation of anilines under similar conditions. Mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT studies, suggesting that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin undergo an oxidative quenching pathway. The photoredox process catalyzed by 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins offers a mild, efficient and metal&#8208;free alternative for the formation of C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, and C&#8208;Se bonds in aryl compounds; it can also be extended to borylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Electron Accepting Ability of Phosphaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphaphenalenes, extended &#960; conjugates with the incorporation of phosphorus, are attractive avenues towards molecular materials for the applications in organic electronics, but their electron accepting ability have not been investigated. In this study, we present systematic studies on the reductive behavior of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide by chemical and electrochemical methods. The chemical reduction of the phosphaphenalene by alkali metals reveals the facile P&#8210;C bond cleavage to form phosphaphenalenide anion, which functions as a transfer block for structure modification on the phosphorus atom. In contrast, the pentavalent P&#8208;oxide reacts with one or two equivalents of elemental sodium to form stable radical anion and dianion salts, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) As Hydrogen Storage Materials At Near&#8208;Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen may play a critical role in our efforts to de&#8208;carbonize by 2050. However, there remain technical challenges in the storage and transport of hydrogen. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown significant promise for hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperatures. A material that can meet the US department of energy (DOE) ultimate goal of 6.5 wt. % for gravimetric performance and 50g/L for volumetric storage at near&#8208;ambient temperatures would unlock hydrogen as a future fuel source for on&#8208;board applications. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks typically have low heat of adsorptions (i.e. 4&#8208;7 kJ/mol), whereas for storing significant quantities of hydrogen at near&#8208;ambient temperatures, 15&#8208;25 kJ/mol is likely required. In this review we explore the current methods used (i.e., open&#8208;metal sites, alkali dopants and hydrogen spillover) for promoting strong adsorption within MOFs. Further we discuss MOF&#8208;based materials with respect to the technical aspects of deliverable capacity, kinetics and stability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen may play a critical role in our efforts to de-carbonize by 2050. However, there remain technical challenges in the storage and transport of hydrogen. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown significant promise for hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperatures. A material that can meet the US department of energy (DOE) ultimate goal of 6.5 wt. % for gravimetric performance and 50g/L for volumetric storage at near-ambient temperatures would unlock hydrogen as a future fuel source for on-board applications. Metal-organic frameworks typically have low heat of adsorptions (i.e. 4-7 kJ/mol), whereas for storing significant quantities of hydrogen at near-ambient temperatures, 15-25 kJ/mol is likely required. In this review we explore the current methods used (i.e., open-metal sites, alkali dopants and hydrogen spillover) for promoting strong adsorption within MOFs. Further we discuss MOF-based materials with respect to the technical aspects of deliverable capacity, kinetics and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Visible Light&#8208;Induced C(sp2)&#8722;H Arylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and coumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a visible light&#8208;induced C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation method for quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and coumarins using iodonium ylides without the need for external photocatalysts. The protocol demonstrates a broad substrate scope, enabling the arylation of diverse heterocycles through a simple and mild procedure. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction showcases its applicability in the efficient synthesis of biologically active molecules. Computational investigations at the CASPT2//CASSCF/PCM level of theory revealed that the excited state of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one facilitates electron transfer from its &#960; bond to the antibonding orbital of the C&#8722;I bond in the iodonium ylide, ultimately leading to the formation of an aryl radical, which subsequently participates in the C&#8208;H arylation process. In addition, our calculations reveal that via single&#8208; electron transfer (SET) process, the C&#8722;I bond cleavage in iodonium ylide and new C&#8722;C bond formation between resultant aryl radical and cationic quinoxaline species take place in a concerned manner. This enables the arylation reaction to efficiently proceed along an energy&#8208;efficient route.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Efficient Eu(III) and Yb(III) Sensitisation from a Re(I) Tetrazolato Triangular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of Re(CO)5Br with deprotonated 1H&#8208;(5&#8208;(2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine)pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)tetrazole yields a triangular assembly formed by tricarbonyl Re(I) vertices. Photophysical measurements reveal blue&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 520 nm, 32% quantum yield, and 2430 ns long&#8208;lived excited state decay lifetime in deaerated dichloromethane solution. Coordination of lanthanoid ions to the terpyridine units red&#8208;shifts the emission to 570 nm and also reveals efficient (90%) and fast sensitisation to both Eu(III) and Yb(III) at room temperature, with a similar rate constant kET of the order of 107 s&#8208;1. Efficient sensitisation of Eu(III) from Re(I) is unprecedented, especially when considering the close proximity in energy between the donor and acceptor excited states. On the other hand, comparative measurements at 77 K reveal that energy transfer to Yb(III) is two orders of magnitude slower than that to Eu(III). A two&#8208;step mechanism of sensitisation is therefore proposed, whereby the rate&#8208;determining step is a thermally activated energy transfer step between the Re(I) centre and the terpyridine functionality, followed by rapid energy transfer to the respective Ln(III) excited states. At 77 K, the direct Re(I) to Eu(III) energy transfer seems to proceed via a ligand&#8208;mediated superexchange Dexter&#8208;type mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Constrution of Quinazoline&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Multicomponent Reaction for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinazoline (Qz)&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been constructed via a three&#8208;component reaction of ortho&#8208;acylanilines, benzaldehydes and NH4OAc. The structure of Qz&#8208;COFs has been confirmed by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. The Qz&#8208;COFs possess high chemical stability, showing good endurance to strong acid, strong base, oxidant, reductant and other conditions. Particularly, Qz&#8208;COF&#8208;3 can catalyze the aerobic photooxidation of toluene and other compounds containing C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation &#160;reaction of exocyclic enamines/enol ethers with 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone esters has been developed, providing facile access to N,O&#8208; spiroketals and spiroketals under mild conditions with broad substrate scope (26 examples, 71&#8208;94% yields). Gram scale synthesis and chemical transformations demonstrated that this method is potentially useful in the synthesis of natural products and drugs containing a N,O&#8208; spiroketal moiety. The chiral N,O&#8208;spiroketal could be obtained with 98% ee after recrystallization, when a chiral SaBOX ligand was employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Heavy Atom Effect in Germylene for Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is worth but still challenging to develop the low&#8208;valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene&#8208;based persistent phosphors by introduction of low&#8208;valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors CzGe and its series of derivatives, namely CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low&#8208;valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled GeCz had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309 ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84 %, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors.This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Pathways in the Triplet States Population for a Naphthalenediimide&#8208;C60 Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The link of an antenna dye with an electron spin converter, in this case naphthalenediimide and C60, produces a system with a rich photophysics including the detection of more than one triplet state on the long timescale (tens of &#181;s). Beside the use of optical spectroscopies in the ns and in the fs time scale, we used time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (TREPR) to study the system evolution following photoexcitation. TREPR keeps track of the formation path of the triplet states through specific spin polarization patterns observed in the spectra. The flexibility of the linker plays a role in favouring either electron transfer or energy transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time LSPR&#8208;Based Study of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LSPR spectroscopy is applied to monitor the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer like deposition of twelve different MOFs based on Cu, Al, Fe and Zn. The microfluidic setup of LSPR enables an in&#8208;situ spectroscopic readout based on the plasmonic properties of immobilized gold nanoparticle sensors under mild synthesis conditions. The MOF&#8208;coated nanoparticles can be used in gas sensing applications.







Abstract
MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88&#8197;A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a very promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include the optimization of the synthesis process or the transfer to other materials.

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and multiple modifications toward linkage lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, thus boosting photogenerated carrier separation and migration, enabling remarkably promoted photoctalytic HER performance, which highlights the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.







Abstract
Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that multiple modifications toward linkage synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8722;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3 a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration. This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation of the Fungal Metabolite (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B: Inhibition of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal metabolite that inhibits Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk), showing immunomodulatory potential. Docking revealed binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk active site. Newly synthesised analogues were tested, corroborating docking observations and highlighting the requirements for Btk inhibition and selectivity. These findings inform the development of new Btk inhibitors for leukemia and immune disorders.







Abstract
The natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti&#8208;cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure&#8208;based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B&#8208;based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.

         <title>Overcrowded 14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes: Challenges in Syntheses and Atypical Property of Lacking Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer (SBCT)</title>

         <dc:description>
The overcrowded biaryl bears two highly distorted molecular halves and a small interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties (31&#176;, currently the lowest reported value). The close contact between the two aryl fragments endows them with intramolecular interactions. Whereas the restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond suspends the formation of the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state.







Abstract
14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes (BDBAs) were prepared by iridium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;biterphenylene with alkynes. The molecular geometries of overcrowded BDBAs were verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The two dibenzo[a,j]anthryl moieties are connected through the sterically hindered 14 positions, resulting in highly distorted molecular halves. The conformation with a small twist angle between two molecular halves can minimize steric conflicts between the substituents at 1 and 13 positions and the carbon atoms of the central axis, as well as steric clashes between those substituents. One such example is octafluoro&#8208;substituted BDBA, where the interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties is approximately 31&#176; (currently the lowest reported value, cf. 81&#176; in 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bianthracene). The intramolecular interactions and electronic couplings between two molecular halves resulted in upfield 1H NMR signals, redshifted absorption and emission bands, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Photodynamic investigations on BDBAs indicated that the formation of the conventional symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state was suspended by restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond. Such a mechanism associated with this highly constrained conformation was examined for the first time.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Defects in Uranyl Trinitrate Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl trinitrate solid&#8208;state materials are exposed to gamma radiation and characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations confirm the spectroscopic signatures and the presence of a nitrate radical bound in a monodentate fashion to the uranyl cation. Including alkali cations in the theoretic models is crucial to accurate calculation of the g&#8208;values.







Abstract
Actinides are inherently radioactive; thus, ionizing radiation is emitted by these elements can have profound effects on its surrounding chemical environment through the formation of free radical species. While previous work has noted that the presence of free radicals in the system impacts the redox state of the actinides, there is little atomistic understanding of how these metal cations interact with free radicals. Herein, we explore the effects of radiation (UV and &#947;) on three U(VI) trinitrate complexes, M[UO2(NO3)3] (where M=K+, Rb+, Cs+), and their respective nitrate salts in the solid state via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy paired with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We find that the alkali salts form nitrate radicals under UV and &#947; irradiation, but also note the presence of additional degradation products. M[UO2(NO3)3] solids also form nitrate radicals and additional DFT calculations indicate the species corresponds to a change from the bidentate bound nitrate anion into a monodentate NO3&#8226; radical. Computational studies also highlight the need to include the second sphere coordination environment around the [UO2(NO3)3]0,1 species to gain agreement between the experimental and predicted EPR signatures.

Herein, we explore the effects of radiation (UV and &#947;) on three U(VI) trinitrate complexes, M[UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (where M=K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and their respective nitrate salts in the solid state via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy paired with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We find that the alkali salts form nitrate radicals under UV and &#947; irradiation, but also note the presence of additional degradation products. M[UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] solids also form nitrate radicals and additional DFT calculations indicate the species corresponds to a change from the bidentate bound nitrate anion into a monodentate NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt; radical. Computational studies also highlight the need to include the second sphere coordination environment around the [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; species to gain agreement between the experimental and predicted EPR signatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Intensity Circular Dichroism of Head&#8208;To&#8208;Tail Regioregular Poly(1,4&#8208;Phenylene)s in the Aggregated State</title>

The use of nickel&#8208;Chiraphos complex as a catalyst enables the synthesis of a variety of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) with a chiral side chain and provides new insights into the correlation with their helical structure through the measurement of CD spectra.







Abstract
Circular dichroism (CD) studies on poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s bearing a chiral side chain in the aggregated conditions were carried out. Little CD was observed in a solution form, while addition of a poor solvent into the polyphenylene solution induced aggregation and a strong CD was observed, accordingly. Applying the controlled degree of polymerization (DP) of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) in the use of bidentate diphosphine Chiraphos as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, the relationship of DP with CD strength was studied to reveal to show the highest CD at the DP=84 (gabs=ca. 2&#215;10&#8722;2). It was also found that the related aggregation was observed in good solvent 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane upon standing the solution at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8211;23&#8197;days to observe gabs=ca. 10&#8722;1. Studies on the substituent effect of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) suggested that CD behaviors were dependent on the type of non&#8208;chiral substituent on the aromatic ring as well as the side&#8208;chain chirality.

         <title>Dead Lithium in Lithium Metal Batteries: Formation, Characterization and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) replacing graphite anode for developing Li metal batteries (LMB) with the higher energy density has attracted much attention. However, LMA faces many issues, e.g., Li dendrites, dead Li and the side reactions, which causes the safety hazards and low coulomb efficiency (CE) of battery, therefore, LMB still cannot replace the current Li ion battery for practical use. Among those issues, dead Li is one of the decisive factors affecting the CE of LMB. To better understand dead Li, we summarize the recent work about the generation of dead Li, its impact on batteries performance, and the strategies to reuse and eliminate dead Li. Finally, the prospect of the future LMA and resultant LMB is also put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Asymmetric Ionic Hybrid Detergents enables Micelles with Scalable Properties including Cell Compatibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic detergents enable applications and cause harm in biospheres due to cell toxicity. The utility of covalent combinations between ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergent headgroups in modulating cell toxicity remains speculative due to the yet rarely explored synthesis. We close this gap and establish the modular synthesis of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. We restructure a combinatorial methallyl dichloride one&#8208;pot coupling into a two&#8208;step coupling, which reduces by&#8208;products, improves product yields, and enables the gram&#8208;scale preparation of asymmetric, cationic/non&#8208;ionic and anionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. Our modular synthesis delivers new modalities for the design of ionic detergents, including an unprecedented scaling of properties that determine applications, such as charge, critical micelle concentration (cmc), solubilizing properties, hard water tolerance, and cell compatibility. We uncover that shielding the charge in ionic headgroups can switch the detergent species that is toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies. Establishing the chemistry of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents provides a missing evolutionary link in the structural comparison of ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergents, enables an easy synthesis access to yet unexplored chemical spaces of asymmetric hybrid materials, and delivers new modalities for designing the toxicity of supramolecular nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Structural Factors in the Luminescence Properties of Persulfurated Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence rarely occurs from pure organic molecules, especially in the solid&#8208;state. A strategy for the design of highly emissive organic phosphors is still hard to predict, thus impeding the development of new functional materials with the desired optical properties. Herein, we analyze a family of alkyl and aryl&#8208;substituted persulfurated benzenes, the latter representing a class of organic solid&#8208;state triplet emitters able to show very high emission quantum yield at room temperature. In this work, we correlate structural parameters with the photophysical properties observed in different experimental conditions (diluted solution, crystalline and amorphous phase at RT and low temperature). Our results, corroborated by a detailed computational analysis, indicate a close relationship between the luminescence properties and i) the nature of the substituents on the persulfurated core, ii) the adopted conformations in the solid state, both in crystalline and amorphous phases. These factors contribute to characterize the lowest&#8208;energy lying excited&#8208;state, its deactivation pathways, the phosphorescence lifetime and quantum yield. These findings provide a useful roadmap for the development of highly performing purely organic solid&#8208;state emitters based on the persulfurated benzene platform.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). We aim to combine variations in five&#8208;membered heterocycles, their substitutions, N&#8208;alkyl groups at pyridinium nitrogen, the position of pyridinium center relative to azo group, counterions, and solvents, in achieving better photoswitching. Through these studies, we successfully tuned the half&#8208;life of Z isomers of the resultant HAPIPs between seconds to days in water. Extensive spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations unravelled the factors responsible for thermal relaxation behavior. Considering the versatility of these photoswitches, the tunability of half&#8208;lives and photoswitching in aqueous medium allows the scope of applications in several fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole Derivatives: Molecular Probes Exhibiting Reversible Light&#8208;induced Phase Transitions for Energy Storage and Direct Photolithographic Patterning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report azopyrazole photoswitches decorated with variable N&#8208;alkyl and alkoxy chains (for hydrophobic interactions) and phenyl substituents on the pyrazoles (enabling &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking), showing efficient bidirectional photoswitching and reversible light&#8208;induced phase transition (LIPT). Extensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and diffraction studies and computations confirmed the manifestation of molecular&#8208;level interactions and photoisomerization into macroscopic changes leading to the LIPT phenomena. Using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies, the energetics associated with those accompanying processes were estimated. The long half&#8208;lives of Z isomers, high energy contents for isomerization and phase transitions, and the stability of phases over an extended temperature range (&#8208;60 to 80 oC) make them excellent candidates for energy storage and release applications. Remarkably, the difference in the solubility of the distinct phases in one of the derivatives allowed us to utilize it as a photoresist in photolithography applications on diverse substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Practical and Modular Method for Direct C&#8208;H Functionalization of the BODIPY Core via Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct structural modification of small&#8208;molecule fluorophores represents a straightforward and appealing strategy for accessing new fluorescent dyes with desired functionalities. We report herein a general and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated method for the direct C&#8208;H functionalization of BODIPY, an important fluorescent chromophore, using readily accessible and bench&#8208;stable aryl and alkenylthianthrenium salts. This practical approach operates at room temperature with extraordinary site&#8208;selectivity, providing a step&#8208;economical means to construct various valuable aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY dyes. Remarkably, this protocol encompasses a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and allows for the modular synthesis of sophisticated symmetrical and asymmetrical disubstituted BODIPYs by simply employing different combinations of thianthrenium salts. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage BODIPY modification of complex drug molecules further highlights the potential of this novel methodology in the synthesis of fluorophore&#8208;drug conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>A macrocyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor for the biomimetic recognition of the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal antigen.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal is the terminal disaccharide unit of the &#945;&#8208;Gal epitope [Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal(&#946;1&#8208;4)GlcNAc], an exogenous antigenic determinant with several clinical implications, found in all non&#8208;primate mammals and in several dangerous pathogens, including certain protozoa and mycobacteria. Its absence in humans makes the &#945;&#8208;Gal epitope an interesting target for several infectious diseases. Here we present the development of a macrocyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor, resulting from the combination of the structural features of two predecessors belonging to the family of diaminocarbazole receptors, which exhibits binding properties in the low millimolar range toward the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal antigen.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Electrochemical Growth of a Crystalline p&#8208;n Junction From Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our society largely relies on inorganic semiconductor devices which are, so far, fabricated using expensive and complex processes requiring ultra&#8208;high vacuum equipment. Here we report on the possibility of growing a p&#8208;n junction taking advantage of electrochemical processes based on the use of aqueous solutions. The growth of the junction has been carried out using the Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E&#8208;ALD) technique, which allowed to sequentially deposit two different semiconductors, CdS and Cu2S, on an Ag(111) substrate, in a single procedure. The growth process was monitored in situ by Surface X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (SXRD) and resulted in the fabrication of a thin double&#8208;layer structure with a high degree of crystallographic order and a well&#8208;defined interface. The high&#8208;performance electrical characteristics of the device were analysed ex&#8208;situ and show the characteristic feature of a diode.</dc:description>

         <title>peri&#8208;Benzo&#8208;Diindenotetracenyl: Helically &#960;&#8208;Extended Allyl Radical with Robust Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here is described the synthesis and characterization of a stable hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, with a helical structure. Although the helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents, it was stable in the solid and solutions. According to the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar&#8217;s sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD|&#160;of 2.4&#215;10&#8211;4 at 522 nm. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9 kJ/mol at 298 K, which is compatible with that of [5]helicene (108 kJ/mol).</dc:description>

         <title>Plenty of Space in the Backbone: Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical polymerization is the most widely applied technique in both industry and fundamental science. However, its major drawback is that it typically yields polymers with non&#8208;functional, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbones&#8212;a limitation that radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP) allows to overcome. The last decade has seen a surge in rROP, primarily focused on creating degradable polymers. This pursuit has resulted in the creation of the first readily degradable materials through radical polymerization. Recent years have witnessed innovations in new monomers that address previous design limitations, such as ring strain and reactivity ratios. Furthermore, advances in integrating rROP with reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) have facilitated the incorporation of complex, customizable chemical payloads into the main polymer chain. This short review discusses the latest developments in monomer design with a focused analysis of their limitations in a broader historical context. Recently evolving strategies for compatibility of rROP monomers with RDRP are discussed, which are key to precision polymer synthesis. The latest chemistry surveyed expands the horizon beyond mere hydrolytic degradation. Now is the time to explore the chemical potential residing in the previously inaccessible polymer backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Vanadium Dioxide Nanostructures for Smart Windows and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of energy&#8208;saving materials and technologies has garnered significant attention for their pivotal role in mitigating both energy consumption and carbon emissions. In particular, thermochromic windows in buildings offer energy&#8208;saving potential by adjusting the transmittance of solar irradiation in response to temperature changes. Radiative cooling (RC), radiating thermal heat from an object surface to the cold outer space, also offers a potential way for cooling without energy consumption. Accordingly, smart window and RC technologies based on thermochromic materials can play a crucial role in improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in buildings in response to the surrounding temperature. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a promising thermochromic material for energy&#8208;saving smart windows and RC due to its reversible metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, accompanying large changes in its optical properties. This review provides a brief summary of synthesis methods of VO2 nanostructures based on nanoparticles and thin films. Moreover, this review emphasizes and summarizes modulation strategies focusing on doping, thermal processing, and structure manipulation to improve and regulate the thermochromic and emissivity performance of VO2 for smart window and RC applications. In last, the challenges and recent advances of VO2&#8208;based smart window and RC applications are briefly presented.</dc:description>

Accordingly, smart window and RC technologies based on thermochromic materials can play a crucial role in improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in buildings in response to the surrounding temperature. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a promising thermochromic material for energy-saving smart windows and RC due to its reversible metal-to-insulator transition, accompanying large changes in its optical properties. This review provides a brief summary of synthesis methods of VO2 nanostructures based on nanoparticles and thin films. Moreover, this review emphasizes and summarizes modulation strategies focusing on doping, thermal processing, and structure manipulation to improve and regulate the thermochromic and emissivity performance of VO2 for smart window and RC applications. In last, the challenges and recent advances of VO2-based smart window and RC applications are briefly presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Potential of Self&#8208;Activating Au(I) Complexes in Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold catalysis has emerged as a groundbreaking field in synthetic chemistry, revolutionizing numerous organic transformations. Despite the significant achieved advancements, the mechanistic understanding behind many gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains elusive. This Concept article covers the so&#8208;called &#8220;self&#8208;activating&#8221; Au(I) complexes, sorting out their pivotal role in gold catalysis. We comment on how Au(I) complexes can undergo self&#8208;activation, triggering diverse catalytic transformations without the need for external additives. The most important examples reported so far that underlie the catalytic activity of these species are discussed. This intrinsic reactivity represents a paradigm shift in gold catalysis, offering new avenues for the design of efficient and sustainable catalytic systems. Furthermore, we explore the factors influencing the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of these Au(I) complexes, providing insights into their synthetic utility and potential applications in synthesis. This area of research not only advances our fundamental understanding of gold catalysis but also paves the way for the development of novel catalytic strategies with broad implications in organic synthesis and the chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mausolates&#8224;: Large&#8208;Cavity Chelates with Potential as Delivery Vehicles in Nuclear Medicine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new type of diborate clathrochelate (cage) ligand featuring nine inwardly pointing nitrogen donors that form a large, rigid cavity, termed a mausolate, is presented. The cavity size and high denticity make this an attractive delivery vehicle for large radionuclides in nuclear medicine. Metal mausolate complexes are stable to air and water (neutral pH) and display extremely high thermal stability (&gt; 400 0C). Lanthanide uptake by the mausolate ligand occurs rapidly in solution at room temperature and once complexed, the lanthanide ions are not displaced by a 250&#8208;fold excess of a competitive lanthanide salt over more than one week.</dc:description>

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Kekulene Analogues: Cycloarenes with two Five&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kekulene, a cycloarene composed of 12 fused benzene rings in a circular arrangement, exhibits a highly planar and robust structure. Kekulene has been the subject of investigation into its aromaticity and electronic structure, particularly in relation to the cyclic benzenoid. We have successfully synthesized novel bowl&#8208;shaped kekulene analogues with five&#8208;membered rings incorporated into the kekulene structure. The results of DFT calculations and VT&#8208;NMR spectra indicate that inversion of their concave&#8208;convex structures occurs at room temperature. The NICS and AICD plots predict that the Clar&#8217;s type resonance structure is found in a manner analogous to the pristine kekulene, albeit with the interruption of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation on the sp3 carbons at the five&#8208;membered rings. Despite the presence of the Clar&#8217;s resonance structure, the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction proceeded smoothly with a dienophile, in contrast to the behavior of planar kekulene derivatives. This study will lead to the creation of novel bowl&#8208;shaped compounds and development of reactivity in aromatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, synthesis, and evaluation of BCL&#8208;2 targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BCL&#8208;2, a member of the BCL&#8208;2 protein family, is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Due to its aberrant activity, it is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers and represents an attractive target for the development of therapeutics that antagonize its activity. A selective BCL&#8208;2 inhibitor, venetoclax, was approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematologic malignancies, validating BCL&#8208;2 as an anticancer target. Since then, alternative therapeutic approaches to modulate the activity of BCL&#8208;2 have been explored, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras. Despite numerous research groups focusing on developing degraders of BCL&#8208;2 family member proteins, selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTACs remain elusive, as disclosed compounds only show dual BCL&#8208;xL/BCL&#8208;2 degradation. Herein, we report our efforts to develop BCL&#8208;2 degraders by incorporating two BCL&#8208;2 binding moieties into chimeric compounds that aim to hijack one of three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and IAPs. Even though our project did not result in obtaining a potent and selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTAC, our research will aid in understanding the narrow chemical space of BCL&#8208;2 degraders.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Photocatalytic H2 Production by Introduction of Pyrazinyls to WRCs and a New tris&#8208;Rhenium Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of pyridyl by pyrazinyl in ligands of polypyridyl&#8208;based cobalt water reducing catalysts (WRC) shifts reduction potentials anodically. Together with a new, trinuclear ReI photosensitizer, these WRCs show strongly improved photocatalytic performances in turnover numbers (TONs) and maximal H2 evolution rate. Depending on the catalyst structure, up to 65 kTONs at 1 &#956;M WRC concentration were reached. Under electrocatalytic conditions in both DMF and H2O, one of the reported WRCs displays remarkable stability, producing H2 steadily over 21 and 14 d, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Reductive Recycling of Cathode Materials of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to digest lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode material recycling and regeneration methods based on the reduction reaction mechanism. It discusses several reductants commonly used in the recycling process, and introduces some recently proposed direct regeneration methods. Finally, it concludes and outlooks the battery recycling based on the reduction reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high&#8208;value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms. This deficiency of awareness highlights the need for further research and development in this area. This review aims to systematically review and thoroughly discuss the reduction reaction mechanism of each method regarding different cathode materials. And systematically digest the selection of reducing agent and the effect of reduction reaction on material regeneration are systematically digested, as well as the impact of the reduction reaction on the regeneration of materials. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing efficiency, economic and environmental benefits in reuse technologies. Finally, the review proposes an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing the reuse of key materials for next&#8208;generation spent batteries aimed at promoting the green and sustainable development of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, circular economy and ecological balance.

         <title>Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the stereochemistry of cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs) is simplified and made more universal. By comparing the (CH&#945;) HSQC NMR fingerprint of linear diastereomeric sequences from automated synthesis with linearized natural compound obtained by controlled hydrolysis, the procedure for stereochemistry determination is streamlined. The adaptable approach enhances research efficiency across the diverse CLiP structural portfolio.







Abstract
We previously described NMR based fingerprint matching with peptide backbone resonances as a fast and reliable structural dereplication approach for Pseudomonas cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs). In combination with total synthesis of a small library of configurational CLiP congeners this also allows unambiguous determination of stereochemistry, facilitating structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and enabling three&#8208;dimensional structure determination. However, the on&#8208;resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow brings considerable burden and limits universal applicability. This drawback is here removed altogether by also transforming the native CLiP into a linearized analogue by controlled saponification of the ester bond. This eliminates the need for macrocycle formation, limiting the synthesis effort to linear peptide analogues. NMR fingerprints of such linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide from Pseudomonas ekonensis COR58, a newly isolated lipododecapeptide that defines a new group characterized by a ten&#8208;residue large macrocycle, the largest to date in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the saponification&#8208; enhanced approach that broadens applicability of NMR fingerprint matching for the determination of the stereochemistry of CLiPs.

         <title>Crystalline CdS/Amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibits a highest CO Faradaic efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. Meanwhile, the CO Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90&#8201;% can be obtained in a wide potential window of 1000&#8197;mV with the maximum CO partial current density of 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90&#8201;%) under a wide potential window of 1.0&#8197;V, with the highest value reaching ~100&#8201;% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that covalently linked norcorrole dimers formed closely stacked assemblies based on the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems. The supramolecular assembling event of the norcorrole dimers occurred through high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting. The subtle modification in the linking position and peripheral substituents resulted in complete change both in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode.







Abstract
Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity due to substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is (3.6&#177;1.7)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. In the solid state, 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Heterocycle&#8208; and Amine&#8208;Free Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Molecules for Energy&#8208;Saving See&#8208;Through Smart Windows and Displays</title>

Two new electrochromes are synthesized by functionalizing tetrabenzofluorene core with acceptor units, without using heterocyclic rings and amine derivatives. These molecules can switch color from pale yellow to dark hues and also display electrofluorochromism. Smart windows fabricated using these electrochromes can store the injected energy and the stored energy can be reused to charge electronic gadgets.







Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are an elegant alternative to dusty curtains, blinds, and traditional dimming devices. The EC energy storage smart windows and displays received remarkable attention in the optoelectronic industry as they hold promise for high energy efficiency, low power consumption, reversibility, and swift response to stimuli. However, achieving these properties remains challenging. Moreover, most EC molecules do not exhibit electrofluorochromism, which is highly essential for smart displays because its EC property can modulate the solar heat entering the building, and its electrofluorochromic (EFC) aspects can create lighting during the night. In this work, a structure&#8208;property relationship is utilized to develop new electrochromes that can store the injected charge, and these molecules indeed exhibit electrofluorochromism. The compounds are synthesized from tetrabenzofluorene with two aromatic acceptor units, and avoids the use of widely studied heterocycles and amine derivatives. The electrochromes switches from yellow to dark hue in solution, solid, and gel state. The compounds display exceptional electrochemical stability and reversibility in 1000 cycles and capacity retention of 93&#8211;100&#8201;% in 300 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device fabrication of the self&#8208;dimming EC smart window presented here demonstrates that it can furnish visual comfort, modulate transmitted light and glare, and reduce energy usage.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer from an imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand to a covalently bound photooxidant was characterized. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded imidazole accepts the phenolic proton and releases a proton from its 1&#8208;nitrogen group stabilizing the oxidized state. The system works with low driving force and closely mimics the Tyrz&#8208;His couple at the donor side of photosystem II.







Abstract
A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&#964;&lt;50&#8197;ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5&#8211;9&#8197;&#956;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1&#8208;nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Proton-coupled electron transfer from an imidazole-phenol ligand to a covalently bound photooxidant was characterized. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the hydrogen-bonded imidazole accepts the phenolic proton and releases a proton from its 1-nitrogen group stabilizing the oxidized state. The system works with low driving force and closely mimics the Tyrz-His couple at the donor side of photosystem II.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Triazole&#8208;Derived Mesoionic Imines with Ferrocenyl Substituents and their Metal Complexes: Directed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, Unusual C&#8722;H Activation and Ion&#8208;Pair Formation</title>

The properties of redox&#8208;active MIIs and their metal complexes are shown to be strongly influenced by non&#8208;covalent interactions such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair formation.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis, characterization and complexation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted MIIs (mesoionic imines) and their metal complexes. In the free MIIs, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between the imine&#8208;N and the C&#8722;H bonds of the ferrocenyl substituents both in the solid state and in solution. The influence of this hydrogen bonding is so strong that complexation of the MIIs with [IrCp*Cl2]2 yields unique six&#8208;membered iridacycles via C&#8722;H&#8208;activation of the corresponding C&#8722;H&#8208;site at the Fc&#8208;substituent and not the Ph&#8208;substituent. This result is in contrast to previous reports in which always a preferential C&#8722;H activation at the phenyl substituent is observed in competitive reactions in the presence of ferrocenyl substituents. The corresponding Ir complexes formed after in&#8208;situ halide exchange reaction exist in either [Ir&#8722;I] contact or as [Ir]+I&#8722; solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs depending on the solvent polarity. The iodide coordinated and solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs display drastically different physical properties. The TEP (Tolman&#8208;electronic&#8208;parameter) of these ligands was determined and lines up with previously reported MII&#8208;ligands. The redox properties were investigated by a combination of electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. We show here how non&#8208;covalent interactions can have a drastic influence on the physical and chemical properties of these new class of compounds.

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfect combination of nucleotide chemistry and enzyme catalysis. The work describes the efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic production of stable isotope labeled RNA building blocks. The synthetic route outcompetes previously reported procedures and makes the production of stable isotope labeled pseudouridine RNA building blocks economically reasonable.







Abstract
Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to pseudouridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63&#8197;nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI&#8208;labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.

1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;Substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes undergo electrocyclization followed by elimination of phenylsulfinic acid, both in the gas phase, to give (4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls during sublimation. Pure, high&#8208;quality single crystals of the product grow in the desublimation area. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new atomistic model called MechaPredict uses DFT to predict the Young's modulus of crystal surfaces to within numerical accuracy. Within a computer, a crystal surface experiences mechanical stress leading to an accurate estimate of the surface mechanical properties. Crucially, unlike the existing experimental nanoindentation technique, which must be done serially on one crystal facet at a time, MechaPredict can perform multiple computations for multiple crystals and their facets. In the cover image, only one CPU core is being used, leaving the impression that the unused CPU cores can be used to perform additional high&#8208;throughput computations of dozens of crystal surfaces, saving time, effort and money in the quest for the discovery of new mechanically responsive molecular crystals. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;C. Sun, S. Mohamed and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400779).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework PCN&#8208;224 Combined Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles for Hypoxia Relief and Synergistic Photodynamic/Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a tumor targeted nanoplatform (PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA). HA can specifically target 4T1 cells and Co3O4 can produce oxygen in&#8197;situ to alleviate the hypoxic environment of the tumor. This nanosystem presents reliable biosafety performance, and can combine with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are promising tumor treatments mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have the advantages of being minimally invasive. However, the hypoxia of tumor microenvironment and poor target ability often reduce the therapeutic effect. Here we propose a tumor targeted nanoplatform PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA for enhanced PDT and synergistic CDT, constructed by hyaluronate&#8208;modified Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224. Co3O4 can catalyze the decomposition of highly expressed H2O2 in tumor cells to produce oxygen and alleviate the problem of hypoxia. It can also produce hydroxyl radicals according to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction for chemical dynamic therapy, significantly improving the therapeutic effect. The cell survival experiment showed that after in&#8197;vitro treatment, 4T1 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells died in a large area under the anaerobic state, while the survival ability of normal cell L02 was nearly unchanged. This result effectively indicated that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA could effectively relieve tumor hypoxia and improve the effect of PDT and synergistic CDT. Cell uptake experiments showed that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA had good targeting properties and could effectively aggregate in tumor cells. In vivo experiments on mice, PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA presented reliable biosafety performance, and can cooperate with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Encumbered Boron Lewis Acid Enabled by an Organotellurium&#8208;Based Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new boron Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 combines one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres with a Lewis acidity comparable to that of B(C6F5)3. It additionally provides ligand transfer reactivity towards fluoride compounds as shown in the synthesis of an Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine species.







Abstract
Lewis acidic boron compounds are ubiquitous in chemistry due to their numerous applications, yet tuning and optimizing their properties towards different purposes is still a challenging field of research. In this work, the boron&#8208;based Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 was synthesized by reaction of the teflate derivative HOTeF3(C6F5)2 with BCl3 or BCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. This new compound presents a remarkably high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, as well as one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres known in the literature. Theoretical and experimental methods revealed that B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 exhibits a comparable Lewis acidity to that of the well&#8208;known B(C6F5)3. The affinity of B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 towards pyridine was accessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and compared to that of B(OTeF5)3 and B(C6F5)3. The ligand&#8208;transfer reactivity of this new boron compound towards different fluorides was demonstrated by the formation of an anionic Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine(III) species.

         <title>A Mechanistic Spectrum of O&#8722;H Bond Cleavage Observed for Reactions of Phenols with a Manganese Superoxo Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of MnIII(BDPBrP)(O2&#8901;) (1) with Me2NPhOH and NO2PhOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceed via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) and proton transfer (PT) to produce MnIII(BDPBrP)(OOH) (2) and [MnIV(BDPBrP)(OOH)]+ (3), respectively. Intriguingly, two routes of CPET and sequential PT and electron transfer (ET) were invoked for the reactions of 1 with ClPhOH and MeOPhOH to ultimately generate 2.







Abstract
Reaction of a rare and well&#8208;characterized MnIII&#8208;superoxo species, Mn(BDPBrP)(O2&#8901;) (1, H2BDPBrP=2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;bromo)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)methyl)pyridine), with 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenol at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceeds via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) to produce a MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, Mn(BDPBrP)(OOH) (2), alongside 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenoxy radical; whereas, upon treatment with 4&#8208;nitrophenol, complex 1 undergoes a proton transfer process to afford a MnIV&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [Mn(BDPBrP)(OOH)]+ (3). Intriguingly, the reactions of 1 with 4&#8208;chlorophenol and 4&#8208;methoxyphenol follow two routes of CPET and sequential proton and electron transfer to furnish complex 2 in the end. UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopic studies coupled with DFT calculations provided support for this wide mechanistic spectrum of activating various phenol O&#8722;H bonds by a single MnIII&#8208;superoxo complex, 1.

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of a rare and well-characterized Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-superoxo species, Mn(BDP&lt;sup&gt;Br&lt;/sup&gt;P)(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDP&lt;sup&gt;Br&lt;/sup&gt;P=2,6-bis((2-(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-di(4-bromo)phenylhydroxylmethyl-1-pyrrolidinyl)methyl)pyridine), with 4-dimethylaminophenol at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceeds via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) to produce a Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroperoxo complex, Mn(BDP&lt;sup&gt;Br&lt;/sup&gt;P)(OOH) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), alongside 4-dimethylaminophenoxy radical; whereas, upon treatment with 4-nitrophenol, complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; undergoes a proton transfer process to afford a Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroperoxo complex, [Mn(BDP&lt;sup&gt;Br&lt;/sup&gt;P)(OOH)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Intriguingly, the reactions of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with 4-chlorophenol and 4-methoxyphenol follow two routes of CPET and sequential proton and electron transfer to furnish complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in the end. UV-vis and EPR spectroscopic studies coupled with DFT calculations provided support for this wide mechanistic spectrum of activating various phenol O&#8722;H bonds by a single Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-superoxo complex, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploration of Vitamin B6&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Pyridinium Salts Towards the Application in Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts was prepared from pyridoxal hydrochloride. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions with the redox wave corresponding to a two&#8208;electron process. Under the bulk electrolysis conditions, the reduction via consecutive electron transfer (ET) and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) follows by a proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol product.







Abstract
Pyridoxal hydrochloride, a vitamin B6 vitamer, was synthetically converted to a series of diverse redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions, and two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory&#8208;scale flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10&#8197;mM in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH. In these tests, the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two&#8208;electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol. 1H&#8197;NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept inspired by playing with blocks, in which it is possible to construct various objects from segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. An attempt is made to explain the mechanism of coupling reaction in a ball mill in the presence of cesium carbonate. The usefulness of the method in the synthesis of oligopeptides has been proven.







Abstract
We report an idea for the synthesis of oligopeptides using a solvent&#8208;free ball milling approach. Our concept is inspired by block play, in which it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. We prove that by having a library of short peptides and employing the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily coupled to form different oligopeptides with the desired functional and biological properties. Optimizing the BMMS process we found that the best yields we obtained when TBTU and cesium carbonate were used as reagents. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed on each stage of synthesis by 1H, 13C and 133Cs NMR employing Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) techniques. It was found that cesium carbonate acts not only as a base but is also responsible for the activation of substrates and intermediates. The unique information about the BMMS mechanism is based on the analysis of 2D NMR data. The power of BMMS is proved by the example of different peptide combinations, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2 and 4+4. The tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octapeptides obtained under this project were fully characterized by MS and NMR techniques.

         <title>Photo/Mechanical/Acidic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responses and Information Encryption Design of Acylhydrazone Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polymorphs of acylhydrazone derivative are prepared, the mechanisms of their photo/mechanical/acidic multi&#8208;stimuli responses are investigated, and an information encryption system based on photochromism and acidochromism is developed.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials have received much attention for being potential candidates of smart materials. However, the occurrence of polymorphism&#8208;driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N&#8242;&#8208;[(E)&#8208;(1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methylidene] pyridine &#8722;4&#8208;carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form&#8208;1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form&#8208;1. The solid&#8208;melt&#8208;solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid&#8208;solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form&#8208;2 to form&#8208;3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form&#8208;2 and form&#8208;3 provides a structural basis for the grinding&#8208;induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acidochromic property. The combination of photochromism and acidochromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.

         <title>Ni Single Atom Decorated Porous Hollow Carbon Nanosphere&#8208;Based Electrodes for High Performance Symmetric Solid&#8208;State Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of Ni single atom containing N&#8208;doped porous hollow carbon nanospheres and explores its supercapacitive properties. An optimized Ni doping, surface area and graphitization improves its electrical conductivity leading to superior charge storage performance. It displays remarkable capacitance with outstanding energy and power density and long cycle life.







Abstract
Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO3)2/phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The microstructure and surface area vary with the amount of Ni(NO3)2 employed in the syntheses and the carbonization environment. An optimized amount of nickel and argon as the carbonization gas afford Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar which possesses overall superior features. The uniformly dispersed Ni single atoms within the hollow porous carbon framework fully utilize all the electroactive sites thereby improving the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar reaches 777&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;% and excellent recyclability. The energy and power density of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar are found to be high; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 its energy density is 155.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 600.3&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. At a high current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 the material shows a high energy density of 118.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with excellent power density of 6003.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. A symmetric solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with this material, Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar//Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar using H2SO4/PVA gel electrolyte shows a superior energy density value of 30&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1200&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Strategies to Design Chemocatalytic Racemization of Tertiary Alcohols: State of the Art &amp; Utilization for Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the challenging field of racemizing tertiary alcohols, recently different concepts were developed. Suitable catalysts for efficient racemization and suppressing unwanted side&#8208;reactions were found. Besides Br&#248;nsted acids, oxovanadium complexes and piperidine turned out to be useful catalysts. The latter two types proved to be compatible with a lipase, thus leading to the first examples of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically pure tertiary alcohols is an important issue in organic synthesis of a range of pharmaceuticals including molecules such as the anti&#8208;HIV drug Efavirenz. A conceptually elegant approach to such enantiomers is the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic tertiary alcohols, which, however, requires efficient racemization strategies. The racemization of tertiary alcohols is particularly challenging due to various side reactions that can occur because of their high tendency for elimination reactions. In the last few years, several complementary catalytic concepts for racemization of tertiary alcohols have been developed, characterized by efficient racemization and suppression of unwanted side&#8208;reactions. Besides resins bearing sulfonic acid moieties and a combination of boronic acid and oxalic acid as heterogeneous and homogeneous Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, respectively, immobilized oxovanadium and piperidine turned out to be useful catalysts. The latter two catalysts, which have already been applied to different types of substrates, also have proven good compatibility with lipase, thus leading to the first two examples of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols. In this review, the difficulties in racemizing tertiary alcohols are specifically described, and the recently developed complementary concepts to overcome these hurdles are summarized.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Concerted Addition to Alkynes: the case of Ynamide Silylzincation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An original concerted antarafacial mechanism for the addition of diorganosilyl&#8208;zinc reagents across the C&#8211;C triple bond in ynamides is computationally investigated using DFT calculations. This concerted mechanism, leading to a trans&#8208;product in only one step, results in the formation of a Si&#8211;C and a Zn&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bonds on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;system. We demonstrate that the mechanism going through a &#951;2&#8208;vinyl intermediate and the proposal of a radical chain pathway are energetically unsustainable. The retained concerted antarafacial pathway is tested on experimental selectivities: the regioselectivity, in favor of the silyl &#946;&#8208;addition in ynamide, and stereoselectivity, which is cis&#8208; with (Me2PhSi)2Zn but trans&#8208; with [(Me3Si)3Si]2Zn, are well reproduced by DFT calculations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are discussed using the activation strain model and a chemical bonding analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Packing Topology and Interactions to Decipher Mechanical Compliances in Dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible optoelectronics is the need of the hour as the market moves toward wearable and conformable devices. Crystalline &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials offer high performance as active materials compared to their amorphous counterpart, but they are typically brittle. This poses a significant challenge that needs to be overcome to unfold their potential in optoelectronic devices. Unveiling the molecular packing topology and identifying interaction descriptors that can seamlessly accommodate strain offers essential guiding principles for developing conjugated materials as active components in flexible optoelectronics. The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems of dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene derivatives are investigated. Face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacks in an inclined orientation relative to the bending surface can accommodate expansion and compression with minimal molecular motion from their equilibrium positions. This configuration exhibits good compliance towards mechanical strain, while a similar structure with a criss&#8208;cross arrangement capable of distributing applied strain equally in opposite directions enhances the flexibility. Molecular arrangements that cannot reversibly undergo expansion and compression exhibit brittleness. In the isometric CT crystals, the disproportionate strength of the interactions along the bending plane and orthogonal directions makes these materials sustain a moderate bending strain. These results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending in semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction can be considered an ideal solution due to its green and sustainable properties, and is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize four&#8208;membered ring motifs. Although research on the [2+2] photocycloaddition of alkynes is challenging because of the diminished reactivity of alkynes, and the more significant ring strain of the products, remarkable achievements have been made in this field. In this article, we highlight the recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes, with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late&#8208;stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene active intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.</dc:description>

In this article, we highlight the recent advances in visible-light-mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes, with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late-stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene active intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Co&#8208;adsorption of Alcohols and Amines for Visible Light Driven Oxidative Condensation Using Iron&#8208;based MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imines are essential intermediates in organic transformations, and is generally produced by dehydrogenative condensation of alcohols and amines with the assist of specialized catalysts and additives. Heterogeneous photocatalysis provides a sustainable platform for such process without the using of toxic oxidants, yet a functionalized photocatalyst with optimized co&#8208;adsorption of reactants needs to be developed to promote the stoichiometric oxidative condensation under ambient conditions. Here, we show that benzyl alcohol and aniline adsorb non&#8208;interferingly on the Fe node and the linker sites of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) metal organic frameworks (MOFs), respectively. The co&#8208;adsorption of both reactants barely influences the reduction of molecular oxygen to generate oxygen radicals, resulting in efficient formation of benzaldehyde under visible light. Additionally, the weak adsorption of water together with surface acidity of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) promote a rapid condensation of benzaldehyde with aniline and the depletion of generated water, achieving an efficient C&#8208;N bond creation for a wide range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Benzophenazine Derivatives for Homogeneous and Heterogenized Photooxygenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen is a powerful oxidant used in various applications, such as organic synthesis, medicine, and environmental remediation. Organic and inorganic photosensitizers are commonly used to generate this reactive species through energy transfer with the triplet ground state of oxygen. We describe here a series of novel benzophenazine derivatives as a promising class of photosensitizers for singlet oxygen photosensitization. In this study, we investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of these benzophenazine derivatives. Akin to a molecular compass, the southern fragment was first functionalized with either aromatic tertiary amines, alkyl tertiary amines, aromatic sulfur groups, alkyl sulfur groups, or cyclic ethers. Enhanced photophysical properties (in terms of triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime, absorption wavelength, triplet state energy, and O2 quenching capabilities) were obtained with cyclic ether and sulfur groups. Conversely, the presence of an amine moiety was detrimental to the photocatalysts. The western and northern fragments were also investigated and slightly undesirable to negligible changes in photophysical properties were observed. The most promising candidate was then immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation reaction. These results provide insights into the design of efficient photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation and the development of heterogeneous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and simple mechanical bond strategy can significantly enhance the fluorescence of pyrenes in the solid state with a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect. More importantly, it is found that the originally impure emission of pyrene can be purified to a single emission after the modification of mechanical bond.







Abstract
To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. Moreover, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterisation, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from mechanical bond induced refinement of molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nanoparticles to Perform Reactions in Suspension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) are prepared in THF. Based on their high reactivity, they are used as a starting material in the liquid phase for reaction with sterically demanding ligands, resulting in C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions and five novel coordination compounds.







Abstract
Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr2 either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]&#8208;driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) than [LiNaph]&#8208;driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#8197;nm). The as&#8208;prepared Mg(0) nanoparticles are monocrystalline (d101=245&#177;5&#8197;pm) for both types of reduction. Their reactivity is probed by liquid&#8208;phase reaction (THF, toluene) in suspension near room temperature (20&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) with 1&#8208;bromoadamantane (AdBr), chlortriphenylsilane (Ph3SiCl), trichlorphenylsilane (PhSiCl3), 9H&#8208;carbazole (Hcbz), 7&#8208;azaindole (Hai), 1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (H4nda) and N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(&#945;&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (H2tpda) as exemplary starting materials. The reactions result in the formation of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biadamantane (1), [MgCl2(thf)2]&#215;Ph6Si2 (2), [Mg9(thf)14Cl18] (3), [Mg(cbz)2(thf)3] (4), [Mg4O(ai)6]&#215;1.5&#8197;C7H8 (5), [Mg4(H2nda)4(thf)4] (6) and [Mg3(tpda)3] (7) with 40&#8211;80&#8201;% yield. 1 and 2 show the reactivity of Mg(0) nanoparticles for C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions with sterically demanding starting materials. 3&#8211;7 represent new coordination compounds using sterically demanding N&#8722;H&#8208;acidic amines as starting materials. The formation of multinuclear Mg2+ complexes with multidentate ligands illustrates the potential of the oxidative approach to obtain novel compounds with Mg(0) nanoparticles in the liquid phase.

         <title>Electrophotocatalysis Versus Indirect Electrolysis: Electrochemical Selenocyclization of 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes Facilitated by Energy Transfer, Direct Photolysis or N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new archetypes of electrophotocatalysis, including the first example of energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;involved photo/electro dual catalysis and the direct photolysis&#8208;involved one, as well as a NHPI&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical selenocyclization, are presented. These catalytic platforms enable direct syntheses of seleno 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,5&#8208;dienes with broad substrate scopes in a mild, clean, Se&#8208;economic, regioselective and oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free manner.







Abstract
Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The two electrophotocatalytic reactions and the indirect electrolysis one are both regioselective and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208; and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and are associated with a broad substrate scope and high Se&#8208;economy, and all three methods are amenable to gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, sunlight&#8208;induced experiments and all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven syntheses.

These catalytic platforms enable direct syntheses of seleno 4-pyrrolin-2-ones from 1,5-dienes with broad substrate scopes in a mild, clean, Se-economic, regioselective and oxidant- and metal-free manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3-aza-1,5-dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3-selenomethyl-4-pyrrolin-2-ones. The two electrophotocatalytic reactions and the indirect electrolysis one are both regioselective and external-oxidant- and transition-metal-free, and are associated with a broad substrate scope and high Se-economy, and all three methods are amenable to gram-scale syntheses, late-stage functionalizations, sunlight-induced experiments and all-solar-driven syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of Mono and Trinuclear Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complexes in Differential Bacterial Imaging and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent transition metal complexes act as potential photosensitizers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial infection. We designed luminescent mono and trinuclear cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for bacterial imaging and antibacterial activity against Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), L. lactis, C. jejuni, and E. coli. Trinuclear Ir (III) complex unveiled more excellent phototherapeutic antibacterial activity against MRSA. These complexes could be valuable candidates for fighting bacterial infections effectively.







Abstract
The application of transition metal complexes for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an attractive alternative in mitigating a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In view of their photostability, long excited&#8208;state lifetimes, and tunable emission properties, transition metal complexes also contribute as bioimaging agents. In the present work, we designed mono and trinuclear cyclometalated iridium (III) complexes to explore their imaging application and antibacterial potential. For this, we used Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the most prevalent of community&#8208;associated (CA) multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria (CA MDR) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as Gram&#8208;positive while Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and E. coli as Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In addition to differential bioimaging of these bacteria, we assessed the antibacterial effects of both mono and trinuclear Ir(III) complexes under exposure to 427&#8197;nm LED light. The data presented herein strongly suggest better efficacy of trinuclear Ir(III) complex over the mononuclear complex in imparting photoinduced cell death of MRSA. Based on the safety profile of these complexes, we propose that trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complex holds great promise for selective recognition and targeting MDR bacteria with minimal off&#8208;target effect.

         <title>Sustainable Electrolytes: Design Principles and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive research has focused on optimizing the solvation structure, including salt, solvent, additive, or concentration, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of high&#8208;performance, safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable electrolytes.







Abstract
Today, rechargeable batteries are omnipresent and essential for our existence. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of electric fields, the introduction of electrolytes with fluorine (F)&#8208;based inorganic elemental compositions is a direction of exploration. However, most fluorocarbons have a high global warming potential and ozone depletion potential, which do not meet the sustainability requirements of the battery industry. Therefore, developing sustainable electrolytes is a viable option for future battery development. Although researchers have made much progress in electrolyte optimization, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. This review aims to elucidate the design principles and recent advances in this direction for solvents and salts. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of green electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage rechargeable batteries.

         <title>High Pressure Promotes Binding of the Allosteric Inhibitor Zn2+&#8208;Cyclen in Crystals of Activated H&#8208;Ras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High pressure induces in the crystal of Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp, which is in the dominant state 2 conformation, a transition to a transient state where the Zn2+&#8208;cyclen molecule, which is an allosteric inhibitor targeting the state 1, can bind.







Abstract
In this work, we experimentally investigate the potency of high pressure to drive a protein toward an excited state where an inhibitor targeted for this state can bind. Ras proteins are small GTPases cycling between active GTP&#8208;bound and inactive GDP&#8208;bound states. Various states of GTP&#8208;bound Ras in active conformation coexist in solution, amongst them, state 2 which binds to effectors, and state 1, weakly populated at ambient conditions, which has a low affinity for effectors. Zn2+&#8208;cyclen is an allosteric inhibitor of Ras protein, designed to bind specifically to the state 1. In H&#8208;Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp crystals soaked with Zn2+&#8208;cyclen, no binding could be observed, as expected in the state 2 conformation which is the dominant state at ambient pressure. Interestingly, Zn2+&#8208;cyclen binding is observed at 500&#8197;MPa pressure, close to the nucleotide, in Ras protein that is driven by pressure to a state 1 conformer. The unknown binding mode of Zn2+&#8208;cyclen to H&#8208;Ras can thus be fully characterized in atomic details. As a more general conjunction from our study, high pressure x&#8208;ray crystallography turns out to be a powerful method to induce transitions allowing drug binding in proteins that are in low&#8208;populated conformations at ambient conditions, enabling the design of specific inhibitors.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Detection and Idiosyncratic Removal of Copper by Nano&#8208;Particle Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign calcium&#8208;MOF has been synthesized by microwave irradiation, having selective and reusable copper detection and removal capability from wastewater. This material, upon interaction with copper solution, undergoes a color change from yellow to reddish with a detection limit of&#8805;5&#8197;ppm and has a removal capacity of 484.2&#177;30&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 that adsorbed copper as copper oxide nanoparticles.







Abstract
A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CaMOF@LSB) was designed and synthesized, exhibiting dual functionality for both selective detection and removal of Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The framework&#8216;s stability, including solvent and pH variations, was established with notable thermal resilience. Colorimetric Cu2+ detection (&#8805;5&#8197;ppm) with a high capture capacity of 484.2&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 by CaMOF@LSB places this material among the few that ensure efficient colorimetric detection and high removal capabilities of Cu2+ ions. Batch adsorption experiments revealed pH&#8208;dependent behavior and competitive interactions. Langmuir and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetics models aptly described adsorption isotherms and kinetics, respectively. Thermodynamic assessments confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Mechanistically, nanoparticle deposition contributes to the Cu2+ uptake. CaMOF@LSB also exhibited one of the best removal behaviour of Cu2+ by means of oxide formation on the surface. Regeneration of CaMOF@LSB was achieved by simple sonication in 0.1&#8197;M aqueous NaOH solution. The recyclability was also tested up to 5 cycles, and it exhibited a small decrease in adsorption capacity observed across the cycles. This research presents a promising avenue for addressing heavy metal pollution using metal&#8208;organic frameworks, thereby offering potential applications in water purification and environmental pollution monitoring and remediation.

Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements clearly showed that the arrangement of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains influenced the dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in various organic solvents, including toluene (a less polar solvent) and methanol (a polar solvent).







Abstract
Since inorganic nanoparticles have unique properties that differ from those of bulk materials, their material applications have attracted attention in various fields. In order to utilize inorganic nanoparticles for functional materials, they must be dispersed without agglomeration. Therefore, the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles are typically modified with organic ligands to improve their dispersibility. Nevertheless, the relationship between the tail group structure in organic ligands and the dispersibility of inorganic nanoparticles in organic solvents remains poorly understood. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. However, the structural requirements for amphiphilic ligands to &#8220;flexibly&#8221; disperse nanoparticles in less polar to polar solvents are still unclear. Here, we designed and synthesized several phosphonic acid ligands for structure&#8722;function relationship studies of flexdispersion. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements revealed that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains in organic ligands alone does not determine the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in organic solvents, but the arrangement of the individual chains also has an effect. From a practical application standpoint, it is preferable to design ligands with ethylene glycol chains on the outside relative to the particle surface.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photoexcitation of Aqueous Urea Forms Carbamic Acid/Carbamate in Less Than One Picosecond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the photochemistry of aqueous urea under 200&#8197;nm UV irradiation. Besides a low extinction coefficient &#8211; intramolecular vibrational coupling and effective energy dissipation through the water network significantly reduce photodissociation probabilities in contrast to the results of UV photolysis of anhydrous urea in noble gas matrices. The reults underscore the protective role of water in prebiotic chemistry and suggest a unique pathway for the formation of key feedstock molecules in the absence of biological catalysts like urease.







Abstract
Urea is believed to have been essential to the synthesis of prebiotic nucleotides and thereby the RNA or DNA of the first lifeforms. Models suggesting that life began in wet&#8208;dry cycles around shallow aquatic ponds imply that reactants such as urea were exposed to deep ultraviolet irradiation from the young sun. Detrimental photodissociation of urea induced by deep UV excitation potentially challenges these models. We here follow the primary deep ultraviolet photochemistry of aqueous urea. The data show that urea is barely excited at 200&#8197;nm due to weak ultraviolet absorption. The likelihood of photodissociation is further reduced by strong intra&#8208;molecular coupling of the CN and CO stretch vibrations accompanied by an efficient dissipation of the excitation energy to the surrounding water molecules mitigated by urea&#8208;water hydrogen bonds. We find that 54&#177;5&#8201;% of the excited urea molecules dissociate. Reactions between the photoproducts and surrounding solvent molecules form carbamic acid or the carbamate anions within 0.6&#8197;ps. The molecules that do not dissociate return to the electronic ground state in 2&#8197;ps. Interestingly, the photodissociation processes of urea in the aqueous phase is different from earlier reported reactions observed following the VUV photolysis of urea in noble gas matrices and highlight the potential influence of water on the prebiotic photochemistry.

         <title>The Characterization of Multifaceted PREP1 Peptides Provides Insights into Correlations between Spectroscopic and Structural Properties of Amyloid&#8208;like Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The characterization of an amyloid&#8208;like cross&#8208;&#946; peptide demonstrates that it can emit visible fluorescence with unusual redshifts via a Foster resonance electron transfer (FRET) phenomenon and highlights interesting correlations between structural and spectroscopic properties.







Abstract
The widespread ability of proteins and peptides to self&#8208;assemble by forming cross&#8208;&#946; structure is one of the most significant discoveries in structural biology. Intriguingly, the cross&#8208;&#946; association of proteins/peptides may generate intricate supramolecular architectures with uncommon spectroscopic properties. We have recently characterized self&#8208;assembled peptides extracted from the PREP1 protein that are endowed with interesting structural/spectroscopic properties. We here demonstrate that the green fluorescence emission of the peptide PREP1[117&#8208;132] (&#955;em ~520&#8197;nm), can be induced by excitation with UV radiation. The associated unusually large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; ~150&#8197;nm) represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of an internal resonance energy transfer in amyloid&#8208;like structures, where the blue emission of some assemblies becomes the excitation radiation for others. Moreover, the characterization of PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants provides insights into the sequence/structure and structure/spectroscopic properties relationships. Our data suggests that the green fluorescence is plausibly associated with antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states of the peptide whereas parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are only endowed with blue fluorescence. Notably, the different PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants also form assemblies characterized by distinct morphologies. Indeed, the parent peptide and single mutants form compact but structured aggregates whereas most of the double mutants exhibit elongated and highly extended fibers.

         <title>Efficient Blue Photo&#8208; and Electroluminescence from CF3&#8208;Decorated Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes are developed by using CF3&#8208;decorated carbazole ligands. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence and a high external quantum efficiency.







Abstract
Luminescent organometallic complexes of earth&#8208;abundant copper(I) have long been studied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). Particularly, Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have recently emerged as promising organometallic emitters. However, blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA complexes have been rarely reported. Here we constructed two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA emitters, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz and MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz, by introducing one or two CF3 substitutes into carbazole ligands. Both complexes exhibited high thermal stability and blue emission colors. Moreover, two complexes exhibited different emission origins rooting from different donor ligands: a distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz or a dominant phosphorescence nature from local triplet excited state of the carbazole ligand for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz. Inspiringly, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz had high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 94&#8201;% and short emission lifetimes of down to 1.2&#8197;&#956;s in doped films, accompanied by relatively high radiative rates in the 105&#8197;s&#8722;1 order. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz delivered pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 462&#8197;nm together with a high external quantum efficiency of 13.0&#8201;%.

         <title>Molybdenum Sulfide Nanoflowers as Electrodes for Efficient and Scalable Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanoflowers exhibit a highly efficient and stable performance in lithium&#8208;ion capacitors with an ether&#8208;based electrolyte. This is due to the fast surface redox reactions, particularly the intercalation/deintercalation pseudocapacitive mechanism enabled by nanostructuring and synergistic 2D features of MoS2. Tailoring the extrinsic features (shape and dimensions) serves as a potential path to overcome sluggish kinetics often observed in lithium&#8208;ion capacitors.







Abstract
Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) bridge the unique advantages of batteries and capacitors and are considered promising energy storage devices for hybrid vehicles and other electronic gadgets. Lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) have attained particular interest due to their higher energy and power density than traditional supercapacitor devices. The limited voltage window and the deterioration of anode materials upsurged the demand for efficient and stable electrode materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is a promising candidate for developing efficient and durable LICs due to its wide lithiation potential and unique layer structure, enhancing charge storage efficiency. Modifying the extrinsic features, such as the dimensions and shape at the nanoscale, serves as a potential path to overcome the sluggish kinetics observed in the LICs. Herein, the MoS2 nanoflowers have been synthesized through a hydrothermal route. The developed LIC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202.4&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and capacitance retention of &gt;90&#8201;% over 5,000 cycles. Using an ether electrolyte improved the voltage window (2.0&#8197;V) and enhanced the stability performance. The ex&#8208;situ material characterization after the stability test reveals that the storage mechanism in MoS2&#8208;LICs is not diffusion&#8208;controlled. Instead, the fast surface redox reactions, especially intercalation/deintercalation of ions, are more prominent for charge storage.

The developed LIC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202.4&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and capacitance retention of &amp;gt;90&#8201;% over 5,000 cycles. Using an ether electrolyte improved the voltage window (2.0&#8197;V) and enhanced the stability performance. The &lt;i&gt;ex-situ&lt;/i&gt; material characterization after the stability test reveals that the storage mechanism in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-LICs is not diffusion-controlled. Instead, the fast surface redox reactions, especially intercalation/deintercalation of ions, are more prominent for charge storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Germanium Nanoparticles from Arylgermanium Trihydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Germanium is a promising basis for nanomaterials due to its low toxicity and valuable optical and electronic properties. However, germanium nanomaterials have seen little research compared to other group 14 elements due to unpredictable chemical behavior and high costs. Here, we report the dehydrocoupling of o&#8208;tolylgermanium trihydride to amorphous nanoparticles. The reaction is facilitated through reflux at 162 &#176;C and can be accelerated with an amine base catalyst. Through cleavage of both H2 and toluene, new Ge&#8208;Ge bonds form. This results in nanoparticles consisting of crosslinked germanium with o&#8208;tolyl termination. The particles are 2&#8208;6 nm in size and have masses above approximately 3500 Da. The organic substituents are promising for further functionalization. Combined with strong absorption up to 600 nm and moderate solubility and air stability, there are numerous possibilities for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of N&#8208;Heteropolycyclic Aromatic Molecules: The Acridine Dimer and Trimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their nitrogen&#8208;substituted analogues are of great interest for various applications in organic electronics. The performance of such devices is determined not only by the properties of the single molecules, but also by the structure of their aggregates, which often form via self&#8208;aggregation. Gaining insight into such aggregation processes is a challenging task, but crucial for a fine&#8208;tuning of the materials properties. In this work, an efficient approach for the generation and characterisation of aggregates is described, based on matrix&#8208;isolation experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. This approach is exemplified for aggregation of acridine. The acridine dimer and trimer are thoroughly analysed on the basis of experimental and calculated UV and IR absorption spectra, which
agree well with each other. Thereby a novel structure of the acridine dimer is found, which disagrees with a previously reported one. The calculations also show the changes from excitonic coupling towards orbital interactions between two molecules with decreasing distance to each other. In addition, a structure of the trimer is determined. Finally, an outlook is given on how even higher aggregates can be made accessible through experiment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules, which feature large Stokes shifts to avoid self&#8208;absorption, play an essential role in photoluminescent bioimaging probes. Herein, we report the development of an ESIPT molecule 3&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol (PiQ).&#160;PiQ&#160;not only undergoes a distinct ESIPT process unlike the symmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;diol but also exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#160;characteristics. PiQ&#160;self&#8208;assembles into aggregates with an average size of 241.0 &#177; 51.9 nm in aqueous solutions, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence. On the basis of the ESIPT and AIE characteristics of&#160;PiQ, the latter is functionalized with a hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive 4&#8208;pinacoratoborylbenzyl group (B) and a carboxylesterase&#8208;responsive acetyl group (A) to produce a photoluminescent probe&#160;B&#8208;PiQ&#8208;A. The potential of&#160;PiQ&#160;for applications in bioimaging and chemical sensing is underscored by its efficient detection of both endogenous and exogenous hydrogen peroxide in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational and Substitution Effects on the Donor and Reducing Strength of Tin(II) Porphyrinogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Meso&#8208;octaalkylcalix[4]pyrrolates are a class of redox&#8208;active porphyrinogen ligands. They have been well established in d&#8208; and f&#8208;block chemistry for over three decades but have only recently been introduced as ligands for p&#8208;block elements. Here, we present a study on the influence of meso&#8208;substituents on the redox chemistry of calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) dianions [2R]2&#8722; (R = Me, Et). Expansion of the normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) method, well known for porphyrin chemistry, provides insights into the ligand conformation of a calix[4]pyrrolato p&#8208;block complex. Combined with the results of spectroscopic donor scaling, electrochemical studies, and quantum mechanical bond analysis tools, subtle but significant substitution and conformational effects on the electronic structure are revealed. Exploiting this knowledge rationalizes the role of this class of tin(II) dianions to act as potent reducing agents, but can also be expanded for other central elements. Photoexcitation boosts this reactivity further, allowing for the reduction of even challenging chlorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of discrete multi&#8208;chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of chromophoric systems is a prerequisite to create well&#8208;ordered, processable nanomaterials with multiple functionalities. In the past two decades, the field of functional organic materials has primarily focused on systems featuring only one type of dye/&#960;&#8208;conjugated unit. Consequently, many reports with mechanistic insights on the self&#8208;assembly of the dyes featuring different molecular packing have been reported. Subsequently, we have witnessed several attempts to organize the multi&#8208;chromophoric systems in solution and solid&#8208;state via different approaches using self&#8208;assembly as a tool. Incorporation of more than one dye is important in creating materials with tuneable optoelectronic properties. Consequently, self&#8208;assembly of more than one chromophoric systems have been investigated to some extent. This review aims to discuss the self&#8208;assembled materials derived from discrete &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems comprising more than one dye units connected through covalent bonding (multi&#8208;chromophoric systems). Molecular design of various multi&#8208;chromophoric systems leading to the formation of crystals, liquid crystals and supramolecular polymers have been correlated with corresponding properties. We envisage that classification of self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;chromophoric systems, with a note on tuneable optoelectronic properties, can provide a deeper understanding on the molecular design strategies, which is important in the fabrication of functional organic materials with optimum performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transition Control in Molecular Solids via Complementarity of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase transitions in molecular solids involve synergistic changes in chemical and electronic structures, leading to diversification in physical and chemical properties. Despite the pivotal role of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in many phase&#8208;transition materials, it is rare and challenging to chemically regulate the dynamics and to elucidate the structure&#8208;property relationship. Here, four high&#8208;spin CoII&#160;com&#8208;pounds were isolated and systematically investigated by modifying the ligand terminal groups (X = S, Se) and substituents (Y = Cl, Br).&#160;S&#8208;Cl&#160;and&#160;Se&#8208;Br&#160;undergo a reversible structural phase transition near room temperature, triggering the rotation of 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 guests and the swing between syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation of NCX&#8722;&#160;ligands, accompanied by switchable magnetism. Conversely,&#160;S&#8208;Br&#160;and&#160;Se&#8208;Cl&#160;retain stability in ordered and disordered phases, respectively. H&#8208;bonds geometric analysis and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations reveal that the electronegativity of X and Y affects the strength of NY&#8208;ap&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions. Entropy&#8208;driven structural phase transitions occur when the H&#8208;bond strength is appropriate; otherwise, the phase stays unchanged if it is too strong or weak. This work highlights a phase transition driven by H&#8208;bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and&#160;vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase&#8208;transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.</dc:description>

Here, four high-spin CoII&#160;com-pounds were isolated and systematically investigated by modifying the ligand terminal groups (X = S, Se) and substituents (Y = Cl, Br).&#160;S-Cl&#160;and&#160;Se-Br&#160;undergo a reversible structural phase transition near room temperature, triggering the rotation of 15-crown-5 guests and the swing between syn- and anti-conformation of NCX&#8722;&#160;ligands, accompanied by switchable magnetism. Conversely,&#160;S-Br&#160;and&#160;Se-Cl&#160;retain stability in ordered and disordered phases, respectively. H-bonds geometric analysis and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations reveal that the electronegativity of X and Y affects the strength of NY-ap&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions. Entropy-driven structural phase transitions occur when the H-bond strength is appropriate; otherwise, the phase stays unchanged if it is too strong or weak. This work highlights a phase transition driven by H-bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and&#160;vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase-transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prebiotic Formation of Peptides Through Bubbling and Arc Plasma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abiotic synthesis of peptides, widely regarded as one of the key chemical reactions on the prebiotic Earth, is thermodynamically constrained in solution. Herein, a simulation of the lightning phenomenon on the sea surface using bubble bursting and arc plasma under ambient conditions enables dipeptide formation of six amino acids with conversion ratios ranging from 2.6% to 25.5%. Additionally, we observed the formation of biologically active tripeptides and investigated the stereoselectivity of the dipeptide formation reaction. By utilizing a mixture of 20 amino acids in the reaction, 102 possible dipeptides were generated. These results establish experimental constructions to mimic achievable prebiotic conditions and provide a credible pathway for endogenous biopolymer synthesis on prebiotic Earth.</dc:description>
