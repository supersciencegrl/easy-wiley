      <title>Rational molecular design of multifunctional blue material based on phenanthroimidazole derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with EQEs over 5% are still scarce in OLEDs. In this work, by introducing the [1,2,4] triazolo [1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit to the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole, two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPBTPA were obtained. Based on systematic photophysical analysis, we found that the TP block is suitable for constructing HLCT emitters. Its moderate electron withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring the color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the increased phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increases the oscillator strength, but also shortens the stokes shift. TDDFT calculations point to facile RISC processes in PTPBTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. PTPBTPA presents impressive performances when serving as non&#8208;doped device (EQE  max  = 7.11%, CIE: (0.15, 0.09)), as well as a high&#8208;performance host for yellow and red PhOLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dye into PTPBTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85% was achieved. The successful design of PTPBTPA not only provides an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrates the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.</dc:description>

      <title>High temperature proton conduction in LaSbO4</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanum orthoantimonate was synthesized using a solid&#8208;state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol% Ca in La&#8208;site, were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X&#8208;ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P2  1  /n. Dilatometry revealed that material expands non&#8208;linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown, however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56&#215;10  &#8208;6  1/K. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at order 10  &#8208;6  S/cm at 800&#176;C, but this can be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time when protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The high charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) because of kinetically sluggish rate of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side, and thus an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly pursued.

Importantly, the rich multivalent ion and defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive&#8208;region of ORR and OER, thus affording a low charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) when it is employed in the flexible hybrid Zn&#8208;base battery.

      <title>Photohomolysis and Photoheterolysis in Aryl Sulfonates and Aryl Phosphates</title>
      <dc:description>The photochemistry of aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) has a role in different respects including the application in eco&#8208;sustainable arylations, in the design of innovative photoacid generators and in biological applications. However, the fate of the photoreaction depends on several factors namely the nature of the sulfonate/phosphate group, the substituents present on the aromatic ring and the polarity of the medium. Aim of this work is the photophysical investigation of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates by laser flash photolysis experiments, to have insights on their photoreactive pathways for their possible applications. The judicious choice of the leaving group and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring may lead either to a photohomolysis of the ArO&#8208;X bond or a photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8208;OX bond.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkynes with secondary amines which selectively give access to allylic amines with E configuration of the alkene unit can be achieved in the presence of titanium catalysts. Successful reactions of symmetrically substituted diaryl&#8208; and dialkylalkynes as well as a terminal alkyne take place with N&#8208;benzylanilines, N&#8208;alkylanilines, and N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square&#8208;Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
      <dc:description>Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify  p  &#8208;block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square&#8208;planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, we launch a systematic ligand screening and broaden the class of square&#8208;planar aluminum anions by two derivatives that differ in the  meso  &#8208;substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provokes opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with &#963;&#8208;donors  versus  the aluminum&#8208;ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations are provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode&#8208;selective binding for catalytic rate control.</dc:description>

      <title>Twisting Versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Boron chemistry offers many systems in which slight variations lead to drastic geometrical and electronic perturbations. This article explains the reasons for variations observed in a system consisting of two boron centers stabilized by CAAC or NHC donors and connected by C2R2 (R=Et, Me, H) bridges. For CAAC and R=Me, Et the bridge is twisted, and the molecule is a biradical. For CAAC and R=H the bridge is not twisted, leading to a closed&#8208;shell structure. For NHC&#8208;stabilized systems we predict closed&#8208;shell molecules with partially twisted bridges. This is attributed to a delicate interplay of steric and electronic effects. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Engels et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004619).

      <title>Construction of Helical Structures with Multiple Fused Anthracenes: Structures and Properties of Long Expanded Helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Helical structures are constructed by successive fusion of anthracene units in a helicene&#8208;like manner like a dragon rising in a spiral. In the derivatives with four or more anthracene units, interlayer &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions play an important role in the structures and properties of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The helical inversion occurred via multistep mechanisms at relatively high barriers. This molecular design is valuable as a new helical motif based on the expanded and conjugated &#960; systems.

      <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release by a Photosensitizer to Combat Bacterial Biofilm Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Upon light irradiation, a novel dual&#8208;functional ruthenium compound releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO induces Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm dispersal and liberates bacteria. The free&#8208;floating bacteria are subsequently sterilized by ROS. Therefore, the compound can readily eradicate mature biofilms at low concentration, which reduces cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W.

      <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
      <dc:description>
Aromatic hydrocarbons containing one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals possess rich photophysical and electrochemical properties. The inserted ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) spacer canceled steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages. Despite the small structural differences, the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives showed characteristic photophysical behaviors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Mishiba, Y. Tanaka, and M. Akita. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004744).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aromatic hydrocarbons&lt;/b&gt; containing one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals possess rich photophysical and electrochemical properties. The inserted ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) spacer canceled steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages. Despite the small structural differences, the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives showed characteristic photophysical behaviors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Mishiba, Y. Tanaka, and M. Akita. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202004744"&gt;10.1002/chem.202004744&lt;/a&gt;).

Fujin (the wind god) and Raijin (the thunder god) hold each other's hands: The cover image depicts the collaboration of enthalpy and entropy. This work reports the synthesis of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which undergo unique self&#8208;assembly. The self&#8208;assembly in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of pyridinic nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the &#960;&#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.

      <title>Investigation of Luminescent Triplet States in Tetranuclear CuI Complexes: Thermochromism and Structural Characterization</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly luminescent tetranuclear CuI complexes are discussed in this work, along with their synthesis and in&#8208;depth photophysical characterization. These promising candidates for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show a huge luminescence thermochromism with completely different emission colors ranging from orange&#8208;red (290&#8197;K) to blue (10&#8197;K). The underlying strongly temperature&#8208;dependent excited state structures are determined by applying time&#8208;resolved step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations.

External electric fields can be used to control the reactivity and selectivity of chemical reactions. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical computations, this work provides a desperately needed causal model to explain how judiciously oriented external electric fields catalyze and steer the stereoselectivity of the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

      <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
      <dc:description>
Dithioacetals are frequently used in organic chemistry, but examples of unsymmetrical dithioacetals are less common, presumably due to the lack of a general synthetic protocol towards these compounds. A direct synthesis of a variety of unsymmetrical dithioacetals with one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the aldehyde and thiols has been developed. Statistical product distribution is overcome by kinetic control delivering unsymmetrical dithioacetals in high yields. More information can be found in the Communication by S.

      <dc:description>We report on the results of an  in situ  synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated Zr(IV)&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid (HNO  3  ) and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid (AcOH). When only HNO  3  is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 &#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO  3  , mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate determining step. A higher amount of HNO  3  favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the  in situ  results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 &#176;C, 1 h) is also identified.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
      <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free approach for the N&#8208;arylation of amino acid derivatives has been developed. Key to this method is the use of unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts with anisyl ligands, which proved important to obtain high chemoselectivity and yields. The scope includes the transfer of both electron deficient, electron rich and sterically hindered aryl groups with a variety of different functional groups. Furthermore, a cyclic diaryliodonium salt was successfully employed in the arylation. The N&#8208;arylated products were obtained with retained enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrodechlorination of Dichloromethane by a Metal&#8208;Free Triazole&#8208;Porphyrin Electrocatalyst: Demonstration of Main&#8208;Group Element Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, the electrocatalytic reduction of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2  ) into hydrocarbons involving a main group element&#8208;based molecular triazole&#8208;porphyrin electrocatalyst  H2PorT8  is reported. This catalyst converted CH2Cl2  in acetonitrile to various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethylene) with a Faradaic efficiency of 70% and current density of &#8211;13 mA/cm2  at a potential of &#8211;2.2 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  using water as a proton source. The findings of this study and its mechanistic interpretations demonstrated that  H2PorT8  was an efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of CH2Cl2  and that main group catalysts could be potentially used for exploring new catalytic reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

      <title>Luminescent PMMA Films and PMMA@SiO2 Nanoparticles with Embedded Ln3+ Complexes for Highly Sensitive Optical Thermometers in the Physiological Temperature Range</title>
      <dc:description>Luminescent materials doped with Ln  3+  ions have attracted in recent years a large amount of attention for their applications as optical thermometers based both on down shifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) films doped with two series of visible Ln  3+  complexes (Ln  3+  = Tb  3+  , Eu  3+  and Sm  3+  ) and silica (SiO  2  ) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Eu  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1  film (L  1  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate and tppo = triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing S  r  = 4.21% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K, while for the PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Sm  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tppo]3  film (L  2  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate) showed S  r  = 3.64% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K. Additionally, SiO  2  nanoparticles coated with the best preforming films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8208;Eu and Tb&#8208;Sm) and their temperature sensing properties were studied in water showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.84% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C and  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tpp]3@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.27% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied showing that they are not toxic.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  , with late first raw transition metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2  and CoCl2  afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M = Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintains an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0 &#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380 K, the cobalt complex presents a gradual spin crossover behavior (the magnetic moment varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves  S1/2  (predominant at  T&lt;180 K) and  S3/2  (predominant at&#160;  T  &gt; 200 K). Both cobalt(II) species have been detected by EPR at  T&lt;20 K). The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme = dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2  involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPi  Pr2)2CMe2}2  ], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl  2  led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  }].</dc:description>

While the iron complex maintains an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0 &#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380 K, the cobalt complex presents a gradual spin crossover behavior (the magnetic moment varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves  S1/2  (predominant at  T&amp;lt;180 K) and  S3/2  (predominant at&#160;  T  &amp;gt; 200 K). Both cobalt(II) species have been detected by EPR at  T&amp;lt;20 K). The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme = dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2  involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPi  Pr2)2CMe2}2  ], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl  2  led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  }].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Nonclassical Abramov Products Formed on Orifices of Cage&#8208;Opened C60 Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The nucleophilic addition of phosphites to a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative gave &#945;&#8208;hydrophosphates and enol phosphates as kinetic and thermodynamic products, respectively. Different from classical Abramov reactions, which give phosphonates bearing a P&#8722;C bond, these products possess a P&#8722;O bond. Theoretical calculations suggested that the charge delocalization of zwitterionic intermediates along with the &#960;&#8208;framework facilitate the phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement, thus forming nonclassical Abramov products.

      <title>Single point mutant inverts stereoselectivity of a carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with enhanced activity</title>
      <dc:description>Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of anti&#8208;Prelog carbonyl reductase toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, the rational design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to anti&#8208;Prelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1%&#8208;99.1% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (  k  cat  /  K  m  ) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation.

      <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole Diradical</title>
      <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene&#8208;susbtituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole diradical  ICz&#8208;CN.This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz&#8208;CN)2  containing two long C(sp3 )&#8208;C(sp  3) &#963;&#8208;bonds between the dicyanomethylene units . The minor open&#8208;shell ICz&#8208;CN component in the solid state mixture was identify with EPR spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetric and UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemical data, and comparison with reference monomer  ICz&#8208;Br  reveal that the nature of the one&#8208;electron oxidation of (ICz&#8208;CN)2  at ambient temperature and  ICz&#8208;CN  at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the  ICz  backbone. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close&#8208;lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz&#8208;CN)  2  and especially  ICz&#8208;CN  compared to  ICz&#8208;Br  , resulting in the distinctive cathodic behaviour at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral  ICz&#8208;CN  , its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable at ambient conditions. The UV&#8208;Vis(&#8208;NIR) electronic transitions in parent (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  and  ICz&#8208;CN  and their different redox forms have been assigned with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The s&#8208;bond cleavage in neutral (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  is achieved in solution and in the solid&#8208;state upon soft external stimuli (time, temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue&#8210;green. Notably, in solid state, the predominant formation of the monomeric diradical species is achieved under high hydrostatic pressure conditions (&gt;1 GPa).</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorides of silver under large compression</title>
      <dc:description>The silver&#8208;fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag  +  and Ag  2+  cations (Ag  3  F  4  and Ag  2  F  3  ) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors at ambient pressure conditions. For Ag  2  F  5  , containing both Ag  2+  and Ag  3+  , we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure&#8208;induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF  4  as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed valence compounds of silver at high pressure.</dc:description>

      <title>Separation of xylene isomers in the anion&#8208;pillared square grid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8209;Cu</title>
      <dc:description>Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating m&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &gt; m&#8208;xylene &gt; p&#8208;xylene.</dc:description>

We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &amp;gt; m&#8208;xylene &amp;gt; p&#8208;xylene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational Development of Guanidinate and Amidinate Based Cerium and Ytterbium Complexes as Atomic Layer Deposition Precursors: Synthesis, Modeling, and Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Systematic engineering of Ce and Yb based amidinate and guanidinate complexes resulted in precursors suitable for atomic layer deposition (ALD) applications. Computational modeling reveals the reactivity of the complexes towards water and oxygen. A water assisted ALD process for the growth of CeO2 thin films was demonstrated with the Ce tris&#8208;guanidinate precursor.







Abstract
Owing to the limited availability of suitable precursors for vapor phase deposition of rare&#8208;earth containing thin&#8208;film materials, new or improved precursors are sought after. In this study, we explored new precursors for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) containing thin films. A series of homoleptic tris&#8208;guanidinate and tris&#8208;amidinate complexes of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The C&#8208;substituents on the N&#8208;C&#8208;N backbone (Me, NMe2, NEt2, where Me=methyl, Et=ethyl) and the N&#8208;substituents from symmetrical iso&#8208;propyl (iPr) to asymmetrical tertiary&#8208;butyl (tBu) and Et were systematically varied to study the influence of the substituents on the physicochemical properties of the resulting compounds. Single crystal structures of [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 and [Yb(dpdmg)3] 6 (dpdmg=N,N'&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate) highlight a monomeric nature in the solid&#8208;state with a distorted trigonal prismatic geometry. The thermogravimetric analysis shows that the complexes are volatile and emphasize that increasing asymmetry in the complexes lowers their melting points while reducing their thermal stability. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the reactivity of amidinates and guanidinates of Ce and Yb complexes towards oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Signified by the DFT calculations, the guanidinates show an increased reactivity toward water compared to the amidinate complexes. Furthermore, the Ce complexes are more reactive compared to the Yb complexes, indicating even a reactivity towards oxygen potentially exploitable for ALD purposes. As a representative precursor, the highly reactive [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 was used for proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle ALD depositions of CeO2 thin films using water as co&#8208;reactant. The self&#8208;limited ALD growth process could be confirmed at 160&#8201;&#176;C with polycrystalline cubic CeO2 films formed on Si(100) substrates. This study confirms that moving towards nitrogen&#8208;coordinated rare&#8208;earth complexes bearing the guanidinate and amidinate ligands can indeed be very appealing in terms of new precursors for ALD of rare earth based materials.

      <title>Filling The Gap in The Metallacrown Family: The 9&#8208;MC&#8208;3 Chromium Metallacrown</title>
      <dc:description>
Chromium(III)&#8208;based Metallacrowns complete this class of compounds important in molecular recognition, catalysis, and magneto chemistry. While metallacrowns are usually built via self&#8208;assembly reactions, the solvothermal reaction paves the way for new kinetically and thermodynamically stable metallacrowns. More information can be found in the Communication by E.&#8197;Rentschler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004947).

      <dc:description>
A new borylstannane was invented to achieve the radical borylation of various alkyl radical precursors. Various alkyl radical precursors including isocyanides, selenides, sulfides, and alcohol or carboxylic acid derivatives are found to be applicable to the present borylation. The cover picture of a trapeze performer (borylstannane) grasping the arms of a clown (a radical) depicts the transition state of the radical borylation. The arms of the performer show a vacant p&#8208;orbital on the boron atom of the borylstannane, which intends to capture the clown's arms (radical), and the fallen hat depicts a stannyl radical.

      <title>Crystal structure and ferroelectric evidences of BaZnSi3O8 low&#8208;permittivity microwave dielectric ceramic</title>
      <dc:description>BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic was prepared via the conventional solid&#8208;state method and sintered at 1100 &#176;C. XRD and synchrotron Rietveld refinement analyses revealed the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented monoclinic structure with a space group of P  2 1  /a (No.14), which was reported for the first time. The BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented a weak ferroelectricity, which was confirmed by the P&#8208;E  loop and the 90&#176; nanoscale ferroelectric domain. Although &#949;  r  &#8208; T  displayed two &#949;  r  abnormal peaks at 400 &#176;C and 460 &#176;C, the Curie temperature ( T  &#173; c  ) was located at 460 &#176;C according to the dielectric loss and Curie&#8211;Weiss law. Moreover, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic exhibited optimised microwave dielectric properties with &#949;  r  = 6.55, Q  &#215; f  = 52400 GHz, and &#964; f  = &#8722;24.5 ppm/&#176;C. Hence, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic in the ternary BaO&#8211;ZnO&#8211;SiO 2  system possessed both weak ferroelectricity and microwave dielectric properties. These results are expected to break the technical barrier of ferroelectric phase shifter applications in microwave and even millimeter&#8208;wave frequency bands.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic was prepared via the conventional solid&#8208;state method and sintered at 1100 &#176;C. XRD and synchrotron Rietveld refinement analyses revealed the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented monoclinic structure with a space group of P  2 1  /a (No.14), which was reported for the first time. The BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented a weak ferroelectricity, which was confirmed by the P&#8208;E  loop and the 90&#176; nanoscale ferroelectric domain. Although &#949;  r  &#8208; T  displayed two &#949;  r  abnormal peaks at 400 &#176;C and 460 &#176;C, the Curie temperature ( T  &#173; c  ) was located at 460 &#176;C according to the dielectric loss and Curie&#8211;Weiss law. Moreover, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic exhibited optimised microwave dielectric properties with &#949;  r  = 6.55, Q  &#215; f  = 52400 GHz, and &#964; f  = &#8722;24.5 ppm/&#176;C. Hence, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic in the ternary BaO&#8211;ZnO&#8211;SiO 2  system possessed both weak ferroelectricity and microwave dielectric properties. These results are expected to break the technical barrier of ferroelectric phase shifter applications in microwave and even millimeter&#8208;wave frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanomaterials capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have shown that short, seven&#8208;residue peptides bind hemin to produce functional catalytic materials displaying highly efficient peroxidation activity, reaching a catalytic efficiency of 3 x 10  5  &#160;M  &#8208;1&#160;  s  &#8208;1  . Self&#8208;assembly is essential for catalysis as non&#8208;assembling controls show no activity. We have also observed peroxidase activity even in the absence of hemin, suggesting the potential to alter redox properties of substrates upon association with the assemblies. These results demonstrate the practical utility of self&#8208;assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern&#8208;day enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic zinc hydrides catalyzed CO2 reduction to formate: Deciphering elementary reactions, isolation of intermediates and computational investigations</title>
      <dc:description>Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc centre and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences CO  2  reduction. We have investigated these factors by exploring elementary reactions of CO  2  hydrosilylation and hydroboration using cationic zinc hydrides bearing the tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and the tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Thiocarbonylation as a Direct Route to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Carboxamides</title>
      <dc:description>A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min. were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted&#160; to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.</dc:description>

By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min. were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted&#160; to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the immobilization of cobalt catalysts on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi&#8209;homogeneous catalysts towards an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles,  via  the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins we achieved a 22.6&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC&#8208;NBD back&#8209;conversion&#160;with an initial TOF of up to 3.64 s  &#8208;1  and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, we prepared a series of novel &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; functionalized norbornadiene derivatives that feature excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366&#160;nm, quantum yields around 70&#160;%, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.4&#160;kJ/mol and outstanding thermal stability with T  1/2  &#160;(25&#160;&#176;C) over 100 days. Finally, we harnessed the energy storage potential of these MOST systems in a heat release experiment.

      <title>Modulating rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces on nickel&#8208;copper double hydroxide nanotyres to pre&#8208;activate alkaline ammonia oxidation reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>The surface hydroxyls of NixCu1&#8208;x(OH)2  play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8208;xOx(OH)  2&#8208;x  during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, we for the first time report the rational&#160;design of hierarchical porous  NiCu double hydroxide  nanotyres (NiCu DHTs)  by  considering rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e. annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8208;function&#160;relationship is conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31 V with 7.52 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9 &#181;M), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors.

      <title>Computational insight into the different mechanisms of Ag&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes and sulfonyl hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene can produce important cyclopropane products for synthesis intermediates, material and pharmaceutical applications. However, this reaction is often accompanied by side reactions such as coupling and self&#8208;coupling, so that the yield of cyclopropanation product of non&#8208;silver transition metal carbene and hindered alkene is generally lower than 50%. To solve this problem, addition of a low concentration of diazo compound (decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazones) to alkene catalyzed by either CuOAc or PdCl  2  was studied but side reactions still could not be avoided. Interestingly, however, the yield of cyclopropanation for such hindered alkenes was as high as 99% with AgOTf as catalyst. To explain this unexpected phenomenon, reaction pathways have been computed for four different catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). By combining the results of these calculations with the experimental ones, we concluded that the efficiency of the silver catalyst is due to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step, and the kinetic inhibition of side reaction by a high concentration of alkene.</dc:description>

      <title>An Electron&#8208;Accepting aza&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>
      <dc:description>A bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) approach using an aza&#8208;BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron&#8208;accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) to elaborate a D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with the enhanced fluorescence brightness up to 0.5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8211;1cm&#8211;1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behaviors in emission. The transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#160;&#956;J cm&#8211;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

The transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#160;&#956;J cm&#8211;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembled binaphthyl&#8208;bridged amphiphilic AABB phthalocyanines: nanostructures for efficient antimicrobial photodynamic&#160;therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral Zn(II)Pcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents) containing differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in water media and have proved efficient in the photoinactivation of S. aureus and E. coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The size average of the nanoparticles is determined by the substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, it influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a non&#8208;substituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PS present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective in killing both types of strains, showing an outstanding photoinactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance have been constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (  BTE  ) as a donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) (  Pt&#8208;F  ) as an acceptor.

This unique property enables a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET).

      <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies allows manipulating the subtle equilibria in the given system. We demonstrate this for the case of tetranuclear europium helical cage that is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, we bring the experimental evidence that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky noncoordinating counterions that may trigger self&#8208;assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with noncoordinating anions enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;linking by 1,1'&#8208;Biphenyl Analogues: Substituents and Leaving Groups Combine to Determine the Efficiency of Cross&#8208;Linker</title>
      <dc:description>Two series of 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L = OAc, OCH  3  , OCHCH=CH  2  , OCH  2  Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph  3  P  +  ) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8208;43%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (  2a)  , ether (  2b  and  2c)  , or triphenylphosphonium salt (  2g  ) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8764; 30%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.</dc:description>
