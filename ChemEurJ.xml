         <title>Chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues acting as organic semiconductors for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors</title>

         <dc:description>High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , 0.01 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , 2 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and 3 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors in OFET applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters catalyzed by chiral calcium phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective amination of  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters using (  S  )&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral  &#945;  &#8208;amino&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99%) and good yields (up to 99%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organophotocatalytic Telescoped Synthesis of a Chiral Privileged Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient in&#8208;flow catalytic enantioselective organophotoredox alkylation of aldehydes has been successfully developed (up to 98&#8201;% e.e.) and applied to the fully telescoped synthesis of a chiral active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), consisting of four units of operation: in&#8208;flow asymmetric benzylation, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and oxidative amidation. By using flow technologies, the productivity was increased by almost 200 times compared to the batch reaction.







Abstract
The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom&#8208;designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10&#8197;mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000&#8201;% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)synthesis was successfully achieved. The final process consists of four units of operation: visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric catalytic benzylation under continuous flow, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and a final oxidative amidation step afforded the pharmaceutically active molecule in 95&#8201;% e.e.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was successfully utilized in the optical ee% sensing of chiral amines. An intramolecular folded structure was employed to boost the CD signal. Optical sensing of amines was applicable in a general and precise manner to a variety of substrates, from synthetic to natural amines. In aqueous media, conjugation of amine&#8208;bearing dyes enables fluorescent visualization yet without changing the pristine morphology, providing a promising strategy for surface engineering of soft assemblies.







Abstract
Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here, the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction is introduced for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of a folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allow for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification via Ugi reaction barely changes the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive properties in contrast to dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work which combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.

         <title>Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interlaced mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder&#8208;free electrode exhibited a superior NH3 yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat.) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principles calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The e&#8208;NRR performance of this binder&#8208;free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel&#8208;based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder&#8208;free carbon felt electrodes for use in e&#8208;NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.

     alt="Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel interlaced&lt;/b&gt; mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder-free electrode exhibited a superior NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder-free, self-supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self-assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano-sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet-like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;-NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield (71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet-like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First-principles calculations with strong on-site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;-NRR performance of this binder-free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel-based nanomaterials.

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable with orthogonal dynamic covalent semicarbazone chemistry, 310 helical peptide templates are introduced as a general chemistry tool to enable and tame unfavorable ring&#8208;opening polymerizations by dynamic covalent disulfide and diselenide exchange cascades.







Abstract
A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP). The tool consists of 310 helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers. With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively. Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting. Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of four natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, was developed through a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processes without any intermediate purification. The overall yields and enantioselectivities obtained in this novel integrated flow platform were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min.







Abstract
Continuous flow synthetic technologies had been widely applied in the total synthesis in the past few decades. Fully continuous flow synthesis is still extremely focused on multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8722;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8722;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min, corresponding to a throughput of 145&#8197;mg/h.

         <title>Reactivity of Xantphos&#8208;Type Rhodium Complexes Towards SF4: SF3 Versus SF2 Complex Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8722;F bond activation: Treatment of the xantphos&#8208;type rhodium complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] with SF4 gave the &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5]. Its molecular structure in the solid state reveals a Rh&#8722;F interaction of the SF3 ligand with the metal center. Further reactions with Lewis acids and chlorine sources have been investigated.







Abstract
S&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation of sulfur tetrafluoride at [Rh(Cl)(tBuxanPOP)] (1; tBuxanPOP=9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;xanthene) led to the formation of the cationic complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (2&#8201;a) together with trans&#8208;[Rh(Cl)(F)2(tBuxanPOP)] (3) and cis&#8208;[Rh(Cl)2(F)(tBuxanPOP)] (4) which both could also be obtained by the reaction of SF5Cl with 1. In contrast to that, the conversion of SF4 at the methyl complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] (5) gave the isolable and room&#8208;temperature stable cationic &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (6). Treatment of 6 with the Lewis acids BF3 or AsF5 produced the dicationic difluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4]2 (8&#8201;a) or [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][AsF6]2 (8&#8201;b), respectively. Refluorination of 8&#8201;a was possible with the use of dimethylamine giving [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4] (9). A reaction of 6 with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TClCA) gave the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][Cl] (2&#8201;b) together with chloromethane and SF5Cl.

         <title>Genuine Pores in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline zinc phosphite incorporating thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor and tetradentate N&#8208;donor building blocks has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, this compound possessed not only uncommon structural features but also good capture for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and H2 gases. The possible adsorption sites are discussed, and CO2 gas selectivity at 298&#8197;K is reported.







Abstract
An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores has been synthesized by using zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] units assembled into one crystalline structure according to a hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of a metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bound to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by crosslinking structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding model to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO&#8722; group. Interestingly, this compound demonstrates the highest H2 storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites), and a good CO2 capture at 298&#8197;K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO2 over H2, N2, and CO at 298&#8197;K were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to rapidly diversify molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced with aryl nitriles serving as a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described.&#160; The general concept is demonstrated using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by Click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic X&#8208;H Bond Cleavage at a Gold(III) Hydroxide: Insights into One&#8208;Electron Events at Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp  3  )&#8208;H and O&#8208;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8208;H cleavage step follows a concerted proton coupled electron transfer step (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) center and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  2019  , 141, 17236&#8722;17244  ), which proceed  via  hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8208;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8208;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8208;OH and Au&#8208;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8208;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au center, for which only limited examples exist.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway is uncovered. Thus, the crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA.







Abstract
Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the nonclassical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X&#8208;ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &#8220;switched&#8221; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions and Magnetic Superexchange in MIAgIIF3 Perovskites at High Pressure**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weaker under pressure: The phase transitions and magnetic properties of MAgF3 perovskites at pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa have been elucidated for the first time by DFT calculations. The emerging post&#8208;perovskite structures feature much weaker antiferromagnetic interactions than the parent perovskites. The magneto&#8208;structural behavior of the AgII compounds differs substantially from that of their CuII siblings due to the pronounced covalence of Ag&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of MIAgIIF3 perovskites (M=K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M=K and Rb consists of a transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF6]4&#8722; octahedra and their mutual approach through secondary Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal&#8594;triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF3; this is associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of AgII and association of the infinite [AgF6]4&#8722; chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra&#8208;chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF3 hosts lattices.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylations of Aryl Boronic Acids, Halides, and Pseudohalides with ICF2H Generated ex Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ex&#8208;situ process for the generation of stoichiometric difluoroiodomethane and its application to a two&#8208;step catalytic difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides is identified. The method exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and is adaptable to isotope labeling, as exemplified by the preparation of deuteriodifluoromethyl arenes.







Abstract
An expedient ex&#8208;situ generation of difluoroiodomethane (DFIM) and its immediate use in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed difluoromethylation of aryl boronic acids and ester derivatives in a two&#8208;chamber reactor is reported. Heating a solution of bromodifluoroacetic acid with sodium iodide in sulfolane proved to be effective for the generation of near stoichiometric amounts of DFIM for the ensuing catalytic coupling step. A two&#8208;step difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides with tetrahydroxydiboron as a low&#8208;cost reducing agent, both promoted by Pd catalysis, proved effective to install this fluorine&#8208;containing C1 group onto several pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Finally, the method proved adaptable to deuterium incorporation by simply adding D2O to the DFIM&#8208;generating chamber.

         <title>Biomimetic Peptide Catalytic Bond&#8208;Forming Utilizing a Mild Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the global peptide drug market demand has been predicted to increase, highly efficient and inexpensive mass scale peptides are required. However, the production process raises questions about the cost of energy input, scale&#8208;up production, raw materials, and solvents treatment. This paper introduces 2 methods for the 2&#8208;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction utilizing 50&#8208;100 mol% of a mild Br&#248;nsted acid under the mild condition. One of the methods has been capably adapted to flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100 . The method applies the tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl amino methoxy group, forming the desired dipeptide without solvent at mild temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of the carboxylic acid leaving the group to phenyl ester promotes peptide bond formation, and the reaction were applied to di, tri, and tetrapeptide bond formation in excellent yield without notable racemization at ambient temperature (up to &gt;99% yield and 99:1 dr). And the end, this study proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale: liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide flow synthesis utilizing a mild Br&#248;nsted acid.</dc:description>

         <title>1&#8208;(Azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole &#8211; a Powerful New Ligand for Highly Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>Highly energetic 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole (  AzMT  ,  3  ) is synthesized and characterized. This completes the series of 1&#8208;(azidoalkyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazoles represented by 1&#8208;(azidoethyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole (AET) and 1&#8208;(azidopropyl)&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole (APT). AzMT is thoroughly analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and multinuclear (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N,  15  N) NMR measurements. Several ECCs of 3d metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and silver in combination with anions such as (per)chlorate, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;trinitrophenolate are prepared, giving insight on the coordination behavior of  AzMT  as ligand. The synthesized ECCs are also analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis for all compounds is conducted and the sensitivity towards external stimuli (impact, friction, and ESD) are measured. Due to the high enthalpy of formation of AzMT (+654.5 kJ mol  &#8722;1  ), some of the resulting coordination compounds are extremely sensitive, yet are able to undergo deflagration&#8208;to&#8208;detonation transition (DDT) and initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Therefore, they are to be ranked as primary explosives.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4'&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes &#8208; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of bis&#8208;(4'&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene = benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, &amp; anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;  N  &#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. The compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt; 4 ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous dicationic&#160;compound showed a larger 2&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large,&#160;aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. All cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804; 10 &#181;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1 &#181;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These&#160;features, in combination with its TPA properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of light&#8208;activated theranostic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes Leading to a Stereochemical Study of the Silylated gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes providing the chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying NaOtBu in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Optically active cyclopropanes have been widely investigated especially from the views of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and substituting one of the methylenes with the difluoromethylene unit should be promising for developing novel biologically relevant compounds and functional materials. In this paper, the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes to provide the corresponding chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying sodium tert&#8208;butoxide in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond, and the resultant chiral difluorinated three&#8208;membered ring was unambiguously characterized. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond leading to the transient acyclic intermediates.

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size effects: Ionothermal condensation of dicyandiamide in alkali halide salt melts leads to the formation of extended 2D, layered frameworks only in the presence of small halides such as chloride, and bromide. With increasing size of the alkali halide intercalate, stabilizing van der Waals interactions between extended, &#960;&#8208;conjugated triazine&#8208;based sheets are lost. The main, crystalline product from an alkali iodide eutectic was identified as melem hydrate, a heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based, hydrogen&#8208;bonded, monoclinic solid.







Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, the synthetic protocols and properties are compared for two types of carbon nitride materials &#8211; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &#8211; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C3N3)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. Melem hydrate, obtained as single&#8208;crystalline powders, was compared with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic was rationalized via density functional theory calculations. This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.

A hierarchical asymmetric magnetic mesoporous hollow nanorobot was constructed in a sequential interfacial super&#8208;assembly strategy. This nanorobot with magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion and recyclability not only sets a platform for manipulating motion behavior, but also provides a promising tool for future applications.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenthiazine derivatives have been predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial and quasi&#8208;equatorial conformations can undergo conformation transition and show high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism from local emission (LE) to intramolecular or intermolecular charge transfer (CT) emission. All the derivatives also exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and triplet&#8208;related dual emission characters. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Xiao, T. Yi, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200458).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new soluble CsPbX3 precursor to in&#8208;situ prepare luminescent CsPbX3 nanocrystal film in the air readily was designed. The composition of the CsPbX3 NCs films can be tuned by changing the solution precursors, allowing obtaining a high color purity and a narrow emission width.







Abstract
Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are candidates for lighting and display materials due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the dissolution issue of perovskite nanocrystals in polar solvents remains a challenge for practical applications. Herein, we present a newly designed one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating strategy to prepare a novel multicolor&#8208;tunable CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocrystal film, where the CsPbX3 precursor solution was formed by dissolving PbO, Cs2CO3, and CH3NH3X into the ionic liquid n&#8208;butylammonium butyrate. The as&#8208;designed CsPbX3 nanocrystal films show high color purity with a narrow emission width. Also, the blue CsPb(Cl/Br)3 film demonstrates an absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 15.6&#8201;%, which is higher than 11.7&#8201;% of green CsPbBr3 and 8.3&#8201;% of red CsPb(Br/I)3 film. This study develops an effective approach to preparing CsPbX3 nanocrystal thin films, opening a new avenue to design perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based devices for lighting and display applications.

         <title>Wavelength Orthogonal Photodynamic Networks</title>

Photodynamic properties allow materials to switch between two or more states, for example, fluorescence on/off, biocidal/cell&#8208;attracting. Implementation of such properties into materials requires the insertion of carefully tailored chromophores into polymer networks. The current concept article highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for current, red&#8208;shifted photodynamic networks, explores their limitations, and foreshadows the potential of future photodynamic networks once these limitations are overcome.







Abstract
The ability of light to remotely control the properties of soft matter materials in a dynamic fashion has fascinated material scientists and photochemists for decades. However, only recently has our ability to map photochemical reactivity in a finely wavelength resolved fashion allowed for different colors of light to independently control the material properties of polymer networks with high precision, driven by monochromatic irradiation enabling orthogonal reaction control. The current concept article highlights the progress in visible light&#8208;induced photochemistry and explores how it has enabled the design of polymer networks with dynamically adjustable properties. We will explore current applications ranging from dynamic hydrogel design to the light&#8208;driven adaptation of 3D printed structures on the macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale. While the alternation of mechanical properties via remote control is largely reality for soft matter materials, we herein propose the next frontiers for adaptive properties, including remote switching between conductive and non&#8208;conductive properties, hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, fluorescent or non&#8208;fluorescent, and cell adhesive vs. cell repellent properties.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Strongly Interacting Diphenothiazene&#8208;TCBD and Diphenothiazene&#8208;DCNQ Push&#8208;Pull Triads</title>

Charge Transfer. A series of push&#8208;pull systems comprised of phenothiazine dimers and strong electron acceptors, TCBD or DCNQ, have been newly synthesized and characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods. The significance of phenothiazine dimer in the push&#8208;pull systems in promoting wide&#8208;band optical capture into the near&#8208;IR region, and facilitating ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer as a function of donor&#8208;acceptor distance and solvent polarity is presented.







Abstract
Three types of phenothiazines dimers (PTZ&#8208;PTZ, 1&#8211;3), covalently linked with one or two acetylene linkers, were synthesized by copper&#8208;mediated Eglinton and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions in excellent yields. The dimers 1&#8211;3 were further engaged in [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reactions with strong electron acceptors, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) to yield tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD, 1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a), and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ, 1&#8201;b&#8211;3&#8201;b) functionalized donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugates, respectively. The conjugates were examined by a series of spectral, computational, and electrochemical studies. Strong ground state polarization leading to new optical transitions was witnessed in both series of D&#8208;A conjugates. In the case of DCNQ derived D&#8208;A system 1&#8201;b, the optical coverage extended until 1200&#8197;nm in benzonitrile, making this a rare class of D&#8208;A ICT system. Multiple redox processes were witnessed in these D&#8208;A systems, and the frontier orbitals generated on DFT optimized structures further supported the ICT phenomenon. Photochemical studies performed using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies confirmed solvent polarity dependent excited state charge transfer and separation in these novel multi&#8208;modular D&#8208;A conjugates. The charge&#8208;separated states lasted up to 70&#8197;ps in benzonitrile while in toluene slightly prolonged lifetime of up to 100&#8197;ps was witnessed. The significance of phenothiazine dimer in wide&#8208;band optical capture all the way into the near&#8208;IR region and promoting ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D configured multi&#8208;modular systems, and the effect of donor&#8208;acceptor distance and the solvent polarity was the direct outcome of the present study.

The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO 1 is shown to react with the Lewis acids (E(C6F5)3 E=B, Al). Nonetheless, 1 participates in FLP chemistry with electron deficient alkynes or olefins, acting as an intramolecular FLP. In contrast, in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and an electron rich alkyne, 1 behaves as Ge&#8208;based nucleophile to effect intermolecular FLP addition to the alkyne. This reactivity demonstrates that the reaction pathway is controlled by the nature of the electrophile and nucleophile generated in solution, as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>A Nonaqueous Redox&#8208;Matched Flow Battery with Charge Storage in Insoluble Polymer Beads**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new redox&#8208;flow battery architecture, the redox&#8208;matched flow battery, wherein charge is stored on redox&#8208;active moieties covalently tethered to non&#8208;circulating, insoluble polymer beads and charge is transferred between the electrodes and the beads via soluble mediators with redox potentials matched to the active moieties on the beads. This enables high energy densities without crossover of bead&#8208;bound active material.







Abstract
We describe the nonaqueous redox&#8208;matched flow battery (RMFB), where charge is stored on redox&#8208;active moieties covalently tethered to non&#8208;circulating, insoluble polymer beads and charge is transferred between the electrodes and the beads via soluble mediators with redox potentials matched to the active moieties on the beads. The RMFB reported herein uses ferrocene and viologen derivatives bound to crosslinked polystyrene beads. Charge storage in the beads leads to a high (approximately 1.0&#8211;1.7&#8201;M) effective concentration of active material in the reservoirs while preventing crossover of that material. The relatively low concentration of soluble mediators (15&#8197;mM) eliminates the need for high&#8208;solubility molecules to create high energy density batteries. Nernstian redox exchange between the beads and redox&#8208;matched mediators was fast relative to the cycle time of the RMFB. This approach is generalizable to many different redox&#8208;active moieties via attachment to the versatile Merrifield resin.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Donor State Destabilisation &#8211; A New Route to Panchromatically Absorbing Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(I) and two chelating, anionic polymethine&#8208;type ligands form a novel type of photoactive cuprate. The ligands induce the destabilisation of the Cu(I)&#8208;based donor states and act themselves as acceptors. This leads to an unusually broad and intense absorption spectrum with metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer transitions from the visible to near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
The intense absorption of light to covering a large part of the visible spectrum is highly desirable for solar energy conversion schemes. To this end, we have developed novel anionic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes (cuprates), which feature intense, panchromatic light absorption properties throughout the visible spectrum and into the NIR region with extinction coefficients up to 28,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Steady&#8208;state absorption, (spectro)electrochemical and theoretical investigations reveal low energy (Vis to NIR) metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands, which are a consequence of destabilized copper&#8208;based donor states. These high&#8208;lying copper&#8208;based states are induced by the &#963;&#8208;donation of the chelating anionic ligands, which also feature low energy acceptor states. The optical properties are reflected in very low, copper&#8208;based oxidation potentials and three ligand&#8208;based reduction events. These electronic features reveal a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes.

         <title>Hidden Heptacyclic Chiral N&#8208;Acyl Iminium Ions: A New Entry to Enantioenriched Polycyclic Azepanes and Azocanes by Superacid&#8208;Promoted Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of enantioselective organocatalysis and superacid activation allows for the construction of enantioenriched complex fused&#8208;tricyclic azepanes or bridged&#8208;polycyclic azocanes from simple acyclic substrates. The hidden heptacyclic chiral N&#8208;acyl iminium ion is generated by superacid activation and is the key intermediate that triggers a chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular mono&#8208; or di&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Enantioenriched complex fused&#8208;tricyclic azepanes or bridged&#8208;polycyclic azocanes were constructed via a two&#8208;step sequence involving an enantioselective organocascade followed by superacid activation of the domino adduct. The activated oxa&#8208;bridged azepane acts as a key hidden heptacyclic chiral N&#8208;acyl iminium ion triggering a chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular mono&#8208; or di&#8208;arylation.

         <title>Partial Phosphorization: A Strategy to Improve Some Performance(s) of Thiolated Metal Nanoclusters Without Notable Reduction of Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial phosphorization strategy is introduced to improve the catalytic and PL performances of thiolated metal nanoclusters without notable reduction of stability, by illustrating the partial phosphorization of Au23(SC6H11)16 and its performances improvement. The transformation intermediates were captured and identified, throwing light on the understanding of the non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction.







Abstract
Thiolates endow metal nanoclusters with stability while sometimes inhibit the catalytic activity due to the strong M&#8722;S interaction (M: metal atom). To improve the catalytic activity and keep the stability to some extent, one strategy is the partial phosphorization of thiolated metal nanoclusters. This is demonstrated by successful partial phosphorization of Au23(SC6H11)16 and by revealing that the products Au22(SC6H11)14(PPh3)2 and Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4, with varied degree of phosphorization, both show excellent activity in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioanisole without notable reduction of stability. Furthermore, Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 exhibits better photoluminescence performance than the mother nanocluster Au23(SC6H11)16, indicating that partial phosphorization can also improve some other performance(s) except for the catalytic performance. The intermediates Au22&#8208;xCux(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 (x=1, 2) in the transformation from Au23(SC6H11)16 (Au22(SC6H11)14(PPh3)2) to Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 were captured and identified by mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which throws light on the understanding of the non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction.

This is demonstrated by successful partial phosphorization of Au&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; and by revealing that the products Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, with varied degree of phosphorization, both show excellent activity in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioanisole without notable reduction of stability. Furthermore, Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits better photoluminescence performance than the mother nanocluster Au&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating that partial phosphorization can also improve some other performance(s) except for the catalytic performance. The intermediates Au&lt;sub&gt;22-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (x=1, 2) in the transformation from Au&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; (Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; were captured and identified by mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray diffraction, which throws light on the understanding of the non-alloyed anti-galvanic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Thienyl DPP derivatives Functionalized with Terminal Electron&#8208;Acceptor Groups: Synthesis, Optical Properties and OFET Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel DPP derivatives characterized by terminal auxiliary acceptor groups have been reported. Because of their alternate donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure, the dyes are characterized by a low bandgap value up to 1.28&#8197;eV. The dyes, according to the different end functionalization, show a preferential unipolar charge transport behaviour with electron and hole mobility up, respectively, 4.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;2 and 2.3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s. Interestingly, in a blend configuration of the two best performant dyes, a well balanced ambipolar transport was observed.







Abstract
Three novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based small molecules have been synthesized and characterized in terms of their chemical&#8208;physical, electrochemical and electrical properties. All the molecules consist of a central DPP electron acceptor core symmetrically functionalized with donor bi&#8208;thienyl moieties and flanked in the terminal positions by three different auxiliary electron&#8208;acceptor groups. This kind of molecular structure, characterized by an alternation of electron acceptor and donor groups, was purposely designed to provide a significant absorption at the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum: when analysed as thin films, in fact, the dyes absorb well over 800&#8197;nm and exhibit a narrow optical bandgap down to 1.28&#8197;eV. A detailed DFT analysis provides useful information on the electronic structure of the dyes and on the features of the main optical transitions. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated by depositing the DPP dyes as active layers from solution: the different end&#8208;functionalization of the dyes had an effect on the charge&#8208;transport properties with two of the dyes acting as n&#8208;type semiconductors (electron mobility up to 4.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s) and the third one as a p&#8208;type semiconductor (hole mobility up to 2.3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s). Interestingly, well&#8208;balanced ambipolar transistors were achieved by blending the most performant n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type dyes with hole and electron mobility in the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s

         <title>Synthesis of Intramolecular P/Al&#8208;Based Frustrated Lewis Pairs via Aluminum&#8208;Tin&#8208;Exchange and their Reactivity toward CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchange of the players stannane and alane provides a viable route to intramolecular FLPs with large separations between Lewis acidic aluminum und Lewis basic phosphane functions. Neutral molecules occupy the space between the two moieties and are easily displaced by approaching substrates like CO2, which is spanned in the reaction pocket &#8208; particularly strongly if the residues at the Al centers correspond to C6F5.







Abstract
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me3Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me4Sn. This way MeClAl&#8208;, Cl2Al&#8208; and (C6F5)2Al&#8208; moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO2 is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO2 capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO2 is released again, while for Cl2Al and (C6F5)2Al CO2 binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C6F5)2Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.

         <title>Characterization of Asx Turn Types and Their Connate Relationship with &#946;&#8208;Turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One good turn promotes another: The Asx turn, a H&#8208;bonded, local secondary structure of the asparagine residue was investigated in the gas phase using laser spectroscopy and quantum chemistry studies of relevant model peptides. Comparison of these models with crystallized proteins supports the premise that Asx turns foster or stabilize the classical &#946;&#8208;turn structures, and even promote &#946;&#8208;bulges when Asn is followed by a Gly residue.







Abstract
Models of asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptides specifically designed to favor intrinsic folding into an Asx turn were characterized both theoretically, by using quantum chemistry, and experimentally, by using laser spectroscopy in the gas phase. Both approaches provided evidence for the spontaneous folding of both the Asn&#8208;Ala and Asn&#8208;Gly dipeptide models into the most stable Asx turn, a conformation stabilized by a C10 H&#8208;bond that was very similar to a type II&#8217; &#946;&#8208;turn. In parallel, analysis of Asx turns implicating asparagine in crystallized protein structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed a sequence&#8208;dependent behavior. In Asn&#8208;Ala sequences, the Asx turn was found in conjunction with a type I &#946;&#8208;turn for which the first of the four defining residues was Asn. The observation that the Asx turn in these structures is mostly of type II&#8217; (i.&#8201;e., its most stable innate structure) suggests that this motif might foster the formation and/or enhance the stability of the backbone &#946;&#8208;turn. In contrast, the Asx turns observed in Asn&#8208;Gly sequences extensively adopted a type II Asx&#8208;turn structure, thus suggesting that their formation should be ascribed to other factors, such as hydration. The fact that the Asx turn in a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence is also often found in combination with a hydrated &#946;&#8208;bulge supports the premise that a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence might efficiently promote the formation of the &#946;&#8208;bulge secondary structure.

Abstract
Cocrystallizations of diboronic acids [1,3&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (1,3&#8208;bdba), 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (1,4&#8208;bdba) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenyldiboronic acid (4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba)] and bipyridines [1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) and 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpeta)] generated the hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cocrystals [(1,4&#8208;bdba)(bpe)2] (1), [(1,4&#8208;bdba)(bpeta)2] (2), [(1,3&#8208;bdba)(bpe)2(H2O)2] (3) and [(1,3&#8208;bdba)(bpeta)2(H2O)] (4), wherein 1,3&#8208;bdba involved hydrated assemblies. The linear extended 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba exhibited the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [(4,4'&#8208;bphdba)(bpe)] (5) and [(4,4'&#8208;bphdba&#8208;me)(bpeta)] (6). For 6, a hemiester was generated by an in&#8208;situ linker transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In 1 and 3, the C=C bonds of the bpe molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of bpe into cyclobutane tpcb. The reactivity involving 1 occurred via 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid State and Solution Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl ditelluride derivatives bearing different functional groups were prepared with the aim to study their ability to interact through chalcogen bonding (ChB). Rectangular Te4 and triangular Te3 motifs were observed in the solid&#8208;state as a result of intermolecular Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te ChB. In solution, the use of the very sensitive 125Te, 17O NMR analyses as well as 19F&#8722;1H HOESY allowed unambiguous detection of a Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bond between the diaryl ditellurides and phosphine oxides.







Abstract
The chalcogen bonding (ChB) ability of Te is studied in symmetrical diaryl ditellurides ArTeTeAr. Among the two Te &#963;&#8208;holes, the one along the less polarized Te&#8722;Te bond was calculated as the more electropositive. This counter&#8208;intuitive situation is due to the hyperconjugation contribution from Te lone pair to the &#963;* of the adjacent Te which coincides with &#963;&#8208;hole along the more polarized Te&#8722;Ar bond. ArTeTeAr showed notable structural features in the solid state as a result of intermolecular Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te ChB, such as a Te4 rectangle through dimer aggregation or a triangular Te3 motif, where one Te interacts with both Te atoms of a neighboring molecule through both its &#963;&#8208;hole and lone pair, in a slightly frustrated geometry. Lewis acidity of ArTeTeAr was also evaluated by NMR with R3PO as &#963;&#8208;hole acceptors in different solvents. Thus, 125Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction and delivering association constants (Ka) for 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts. The highest value of Ka=90&#8197;M&#8722;1 was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF3 groups and Et3PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using nBu3PO, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction was revealed by 19F&#8208;1H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF3 and CH3 of nBu3PO.

         <title>Electrocatalysts Derived from Copper Complexes Transform CO into C2+ Products Effectively in a Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper phthalocyanine complex that mediates fast and selective electrolytic conversion of CO into multi&#8208;carbon products in a flow cell is reported in this work. The molecular species do not remain intact during electrolysis, but gets converted into an effective electrocatalyst layer during electrolysis. These findings present the opportunity to use the rich library of metal&#8208;complexes catalysts available in the literature, as well as new derivatives, for effective CO electrolysis at industrially&#8208;relevant rates of product formation.







Abstract
Electrochemical reactors that electrolytically convert CO2 into higher&#8208;value chemicals and fuels often pass a concentrated hydroxide electrolyte across the cathode. This strongly alkaline medium converts the majority of CO2 into unreactive HCO3&#8722; and CO32&#8722; byproducts rather than into CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) products. The electrolysis of CO (instead of CO2) does not suffer from this undesirable reaction chemistry because CO does not react with OH&#8722;. Moreover, CO can be more readily reduced into products containing two or more carbon atoms (i.&#8201;e., C2+ products) compared to CO2. We demonstrate here that an electrocatalyst layer derived from copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) mediates this conversion effectively in a flow cell. This catalyst achieved a 25&#8201;% higher selectivity for acetate formation at 200&#8197;mA/cm2 than a known state&#8208;of&#8208;art oxide&#8208;derived Cu catalyst tested in the same flow cell. A gas diffusion electrode coated with CuPc electrolyzed CO into C2+ products at high rates of product formation (i.&#8201;e., current densities &#8805;200&#8197;mA/cm2), and at high faradaic efficiencies for C2+ production (FEC2+; &gt;70&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA/cm2). While operando Raman spectroscopy did not reveal evidence of structural changes to the copper molecular complex, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that the catalyst undergoes conversion to a metallic copper species during catalysis. Notwithstanding, the ligand environment about the metal still impacts catalysis, which we demonstrated through the study of a homologous CuPc bearing ethoxy substituents. These findings reveal new strategies for using metal complexes for the formation of carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals and fuels at industrially relevant conditions.

A highly versatile synthetic route to symmetric and asymmetric &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY molecules possessing a butterfly shape is described. These dyes exhibit very attractive optical properties such as panchromatic absorption and effective emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
Here, we report the synthesis and properties of heterosubtituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY fluorophores. The compounds were obtained in good yields by sequential and selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahalo&#8208;BODIPY, allowing the introduction of different substituents at the 3,5 and 2,6 positions of the BODIPY ring. The final fused compounds were synthesized using oxidative cyclisation with ferrous chloride. The fully fused compounds show a strong bathochromically shifted emission along with a hyperchromic shift of the absorption maxima. The fluorescence quantum yields remain relatively large for compounds emitting in this wavelength range. Computational studies have been carried out to fully understand the photophysical behaviour of these dyes.

         <title>Cover Feature: Catalytic Reduction of Dinitrogen into Ammonia and Hydrazine by Using Chromium Complexes Bearing PCP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligands (Chem. Eur. J. 25/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chromium complexes bearing a carbene&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;based PCP&#8208;type pincer ligand has been newly prepared, and some of them are found to work as effective catalysts to reduce dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine under atmospheric pressure. This reaction can be expressed as nitrogen molecules (raindrops) being converted into ammonia and hydrazine on the chromium complex (umbrella). More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Yoshizawa, Y. Nishibayashi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200557).

         <title>Front Cover: Characterization of Asx Turn Types and Their Connate Relationship with &#946;&#8208;Turns (Chem. Eur. J. 25/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the gap between crystallized proteins and gas&#8208;phase models sheds light on the structure and the function of Asx turns. A comparison of the isolated Asx turns, based on an asparagine residue, observed in model peptides by using laser spectroscopic and quantum chemistry diagnostics, with the structures of crystallized proteins supports the premise that Asx turns foster or stabilize classical &#946;&#8208;turn structures, and even promote &#946;&#8208;bulges when Asn is followed by a Gly residue. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;J. Aitken, M. Mons et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104328).

In the solid state, due to Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions, diaryl ditellurides are facing to each other, like these &#8220;solid/frozen&#8221; Scottish cows in winter. Once the molecules are &#8220;defrosted&#8221; in solution, new interactions occur with soluble Lewis bases, including some solvents.

         <title>Hole/Electron Transporting Materials for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 25, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses the latest progress with interlayers used in non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells, in which the electron transporting layers are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, nonconjugated and conjugated electrolytes and the electron transporting layers are summarized categories of organic and inorganic ones.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extraction from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the lates progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. In addition, some bifunctional interlayer materials served as both ETLs and HTLs are also introduced. Finally, the prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.

         <title>Nanosheets of Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieve for Selective Oxidation of Cyclohexanone to Adipic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanosheets of nickel doped SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves in thickness of ~10 nm (denoted as NS&#8208;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34) has been successfully prepared through a morphology&#8208;reserved method of synthesis. A special aluminum phosphate in two&#8208;dimensional layered structure is used as precursor and converts to crystallized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve, in nanosheet morphology reserved from the aluminum phosphate precursor, under hydrothermal conditions with tetraethyl orthosilicate and templates of mixed amines added. It is found that adequate amount of nickel, ~5 wt.%, added to the synthetic system is a key factor for the morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis. By characterization, the nickel is proved to be doped in the framework of the molecular sieve, which more likely helps to balance the high surface energy of nanosheet products. The NS&#8208;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 shows excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid by gaseous oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene Substituted Triptycenes &#8211; Understanding Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a series of azobenzene substituted tripycenes. In their design, the switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp  3  center. The azobenzene switches were prepared  via  Baeyer&#8208;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated via  1  H NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to different transition dipole moments of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. In these cases, transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which bear high potential for energy or information storage systems, and among others also in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Lipoxin B4 and its Biological Activity as a Pro&#8208;Resolving Lipid Mediator of Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported. One features a stereoselective reduction followed by an asymmetric epoxidation sequence to set the vicinal diol stereocentres. The dienyne was installed via a one&#8208;pot Wittig olefination and base&#8208;mediated epoxide ring opening cascade. The other approach installed the diol through an asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction followed by a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination to afford the common dienyne intermediate. Finally, a Sonogashira coupling and an alkyne hydrosilylation/proto&#8208;desilylation protocol furnished LXB4  in 25% overall yield in just 10 steps. For the first time, LXB4  has been fully characterized spectroscopically with its structure confirmed as previously reported. We have demonstrated that the synthesized LXB4  showed similar biological activity to commercial sources in a cellular neuroprotection model. This synthetic route can be employed to synthesize large quantities of LXB4  , enable synthesis of new analogs, and chemical probes for receptor and pathway characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition reaction process was proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO 2 with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high value&#8208;added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper using the in&#8208;situ electrodeposition method, and the sample with nano&#8208;dendrimer structure exhibited relatively high activity of 74.8% SC yield with 92.7% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer&#8208;like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction. Especially the Cu 2+ species those were in&#8208;situ formed during the reaction played a vital role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the proposed copper/carbon paper (Cu/CP) hybrid catalyst. Cu 2+ served as the active sites, that can not only electrochemically activate CO 2 but also facilitate the ring&#8208;opening process of SO. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed the electrochemical and liquid phase heterogeneous paths, respectively, which provided a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO 2 resources for fine chemical electro&#8208;synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Teaching an old compound new tricks: reversible transamidation in maleamic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this eld

and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in b&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use dierent preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access dierent library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium compounds have been frequently proposed as therapeutics but their application has been hampered due to lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and enzymes. Here, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound V  IV  O  2+  and V  IV  OL, where L = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with V  IV  O(picolinato)  2  and V  V  O  2  (phen) moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the structure stabilization. Noteworthy, the trypsin&#8208;V  V  O  2  (phen) and trypsin&#8208;V  IV  O(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. Obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of V  IV  &#8208; and V  V  &#8208;complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and formation of different adducts that may contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widens the knowledge of vanadium&#8208;protein interactions  .</dc:description>

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies for spatially organizing multienzyme biocatalytic cascades using porous organic frameworks are discussed in this Concept article, describing how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzyme functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform.







Abstract
Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus make it possible to shield the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows for the selective transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completely encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Isolation of a Labile Silylated Hydrazinium&#8208;yl Radical Cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+</title>

Radical hydrazinium: A highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, formed by a one&#8208;electron oxidation of tris(trimethylsilyl) hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radical is mainly localized along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine moiety.







Abstract
The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8722;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8722;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 framework, in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8722;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960;&#8208;bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a three&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron, two&#8208;center bond.

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and Its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted basic properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long&#8208;suspected structure of [Be3(OtBu)6] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC&#8208;stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.







Abstract
Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is shown here to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2 and HPPh2, as well as the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium were protonated. As a result, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#956;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 have finally been verified and shown to be static in solution. Additionally [Be(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)(HPPh2)Ph]2 was generated, which is only the second beryllium&#8208;phospanide to be prepared; the stark differences between its behaviour and that of the analogous amide were also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared; it is stabilised with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium perovskitoid harvesters: A hybrid bismuth halide salt, [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9], stabilized by phosphonium cations was synthesized and shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization as determined by P&#8722;E loop and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. Flexible composite devices of it with polydimethylsiloxane were fabricated and utilized as piezoelectric nanogenerators with high output voltage and power density values. The obtained voltages were further employed for capacitor charging applications.







Abstract
Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9] (MTPBB) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (P&#8208;E) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33) for an MTPBB single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating MTPBB in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of MTPBB in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an optimal load of 4&#8197;M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of MTPBB&#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.

         <title>Revisiting the environment effect on mass transfer for heterogenized Ru6Pd8 metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst confined within 3D matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd  6  Ru  8  (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 is remained with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H  2  catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, provide a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Overreaction via the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrated a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208;labile and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. An over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed via the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculation of the sequen&#8208;tial nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols was performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the ab&#8208;sence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the linker chemistry on the photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of heterodinuclear photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For optimizing light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectroelectrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry with sub&#8208;ps time resolution under in operando conditions. The results demonstrate for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as an (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence from water stable organic nanoparticles containing a chiral Yb(III) complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of very efficient NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) (around 970 nm) in water, obtained thanks to the combined use of a chiral Yb complex and of poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. [Yb  L  (tta)  2  ]CH  3  COO (  L  = N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;(  R,R  +  S,S  ) cyclohexanediamine and tta = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) shows good CPL in organic solvents, because the tta ligands efficiently sensitize Yb NIR luminescence and the readily prepared chiral ligand  L  endows the complex with the necessary dissymmetry. PLGA nanoparticles incorporate the complex and protect the metal ion from the intrusion of solvent molecules, while ensuring biocompatibility, water solubility and stability to the complex. Hydrophilic NIR&#8208;CPL optical probes can find applications in the field of NIR&#8208;CPL bio&#8208;assays.</dc:description>

         <title>The effects of ring strain on cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (  1a&#8211;f  ) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in  13  C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 504 nm) in  1a  to ca. 178&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 494 nm) in  1f  .</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Star&#8208;Shaped Indoline Hole Transport Materials: The Influence of Planarity on the Hole Extraction and Transport Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planarity of the side chain of star&#8208;shaped hole transport material (HTM) is systematically improved. Along with the improvement, the HOMO level of the HTM is increased, leading to enhanced hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.







Abstract
As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to a considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM&#8242;s HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, which is higher than that of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.

Only one way: (3,4&#8208;lutH)2CuBr4 (3,4&#8208;lut=3,4&#8208;lutidine) is a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate that adopts a bilayer structure with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between dimers across the bilayer and weaker intralayer ferromagnetic interactions. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin&#8208;ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.







Abstract
This work describes a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic&#8208;susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First&#8208;principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Carrying Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piggyback: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs) are an important and versatile ligand class used in transition metal as well as main group element chemistry. Bearing a negative charge in the backbone of the heterocycle, these carbenes can convert otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners. Aspects such as their development, syntheses, reactivity and possible future applications are discussed within this concept article.







Abstract
In this Concept article we provide a brief overview of the design and preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs). The anionic charge in these ligand systems is located on an exocyclic group, for example, B(C6F5)3, tethered to the backbone of the imidazole ring, thus resembling a weakly coordinating moiety. With the general guiding principle behind the application of WCA&#8208;NHCs being the conversion of otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners, numerous transition metal as well as main group element complexes were isolated during the last decade, which are summarized herein.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a substrate analogue has afforded the first irreversible inhibitor of an IspG enzyme, a target for the development of new drugs to fight antimicrobial resistance. Inspired by the structural features of the natural substrate and by mechanistic aspects, we introduced a vinyl substituent to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis. Inhibition might occur through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;B. Behr, M. Seemann, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200241).

         <title>Significant Effect of Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on&#160;the&#160;Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatial distance is an important factor in controlling the functional interactions between molecular units in a conjugate; therefore, the bridging unit was closely examined.&#160; Herein, we examined the effect of the flexibility of bridging alkyl chains &#160;on the proximity of stacked porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated with a fourfold rotaxane linkage. We found that closely stacking two&#160; &#960; &#160;systems&#160;requires bridging alkyl chains above&#160;a certain length, and the shorter bridges hinder stacking because of their lower flexibility. The stacking distance between porphyrin and phthalocyanine in the conjugate with decyl (C10) chains was estimated to be 4.03 &#197; and showed&#160;a unique physical character&#160;arising from short&#8208;distance interactions. The&#160;longer alkyl chains minimized steric restriction inside the fourfold rotaxane and allowed efficient communication between the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units. This is due to the flexibility of the side chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Participation of Solvent Molecules in the Formation of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C) in&#160;n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FT&#8208;IR spectra&#160;reveal distinct internal&#8208;order and H&#8208;bonding&#160; for NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent, indicating a dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block. However, NDI&#8208;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH. In contrast, NDI&#8208;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gel. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental results and provide a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Aliphatic Wall: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved using super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo&#8208; or bio&#8208;catalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to their virtually perfect atomeconomy. Although DRA are well&#8208;established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1 o or 2 o amines as well as ketones with 1 o amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2 o amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines. The choice of a disphosphane ligand (Josiphos A or Xantphos) is essential for the success of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent and Supramolecular Polymers: from Monolayer to Bilayer and the Thicker</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective preparation of two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) with defined thickness is crucially important for controlling and maximizing their functions, yet it has remained as a synthetic challenge. In the past decade, several approaches have been developed to allow selective preparation of discrete monolayer 2DPs and 2DSPs. Recently, crystal exfoliation and self&#8208;assembly strategies have been employed to successfully prepare bilayer 2DP and 2DSP, which represent the first step towards the controlled &#8220;growth&#8221; of 2D polymers from the thinnest monolayers to thicker few&#8208;layers along the third dimension. This Concept review discusses the concept of accurate synthesis of 2D polymers with defined layers. Advances in this research area will pave the way to rational synthetic strategies for 2D polymers with controlled thickness.</dc:description>

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe  3  )  2  }  3  {CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (  3RE  , RE = Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a&#160; &#963; &#8208; component to the metal&#8208;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f  3  &#160;metal engages in a weak&#160; &#960; &#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterized by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that&#160;  3Dy  &#160;and&#160;  3Er  &#160;are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with&#160; U  eff  &#160;energy barriers of 35 and 128 K, respectively. Complex&#160;  3Dy  &#160;is, as expected, a poorly performing SMM, but conversely&#160;  3Er  &#160;performs unexpectedly well.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;state distortions promote the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzenes via machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of benzene is complex and non&#8208;selective because numerous mechanistic pathways are accessible in the ground and excited states. Fluorination is a known strategy to increase the chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also generally prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C  6  F  6&#8208;n  H  n  , n=0&#8211;3, to study their S  1  &#8594;S  0  decay in 4 ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S  1  absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04 eV (&lt; 2 nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C  6  F  4  H  2  , C  6  F  6  , C  6  F  3  H  3  , and C  6  F  5  H are 116, 60, 28, and 12 ps, respectively, in line with the experiments. Our calculations show that the pseudo Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create the S  1  minimum region that prolongs the excited&#8208;state lifetime of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Analysis of the S  1  dynamics suggests that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions promote a  cis&#8208;trans  isomerization of a &#120587;  C&#8208;C  &#8208;bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promoted &#120590;&#8208;bond formation in the 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 is shown to possess strong antibiotic activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens. Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity in&#8197;vivo in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Myxocoumarin B from &lt;i&gt;Stigmatella aurantiaca&lt;/i&gt; MYX-030 is shown to possess strong antibiotic activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens. Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure-activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and regioselective anionic Fries rearrangement promoted by lithium amides under aerobic conditions in sustainable reaction media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward and efficient protocol to promote the metalation/anionic Fries rearrangements of O&#8208;aryl carbamates, using for the first time a lithium amide as metalating agent under aerobic/ambient&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, is reported. This approach enables the sustainable preparation of salicylamide derivatives with high levels of chemoselectivity within ultrafast reaction times, working at room temperature in the presence of air/moisture, and using the environmentally responsive cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent. Furthermore, the regioselective manipulation of O&#8208;2&#8208;tolyl carbamates has been accomplished using interchangeably alkyllithiums or lithium amides, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from the employment of biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures as non&#8208;innocent reaction media.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talks between Sulfane Sulfur and Thiol at a Zinc(II) Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations of sulfane sulfur compounds (  e.g.  &#160; organic&#160; polysulfides (R &#8211;S  n  &#8211;R, n&gt;2) and elemental sulfur (S  8  ) ) play pivotal roles in the biochemical landscape of sulfur, and thus supports signaling activities of H  2  S. Although a number of previous reports illustrate amine mediated reactions of S  8  &#160;and thiol (RSH) yielding R &#8211;S  n  &#8211;R , this report illustrates that a tripodal [Zn  II  ] complex [(  Bn  3  Tren  )Zn  II  &#8211;OH  2  ](ClO  4  )  2  &#160;(  1  ) facilitates the reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol (RSH), thereby offering an amine&#8208;free biologically relevant complementary route.&#160;UV&#8208;vis monitoring of the reactions and a set of control experiments underline the definitive role of [Zn  II  ] coordination motif in the reactions of sulfane sulfur (  e.g.  &#160;S  8  &#160;and R&#8211;S  n  &#8211;R) with RSH.&#160; Detailed investigations (UV&#8208;vis, NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, intermediate trapping, and TEMPO radical interference experiments) disclose the key differences in the [Zn  II  ]&#160;  versus  &#160;previously known amine mediated routes. Moreover, the persulfide (RSS  &#8211;  ) trapping experiments using 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (F&#8211;DNB) reveal the intermediacy of RSS  &#8211;  &#160;species in the [Zn  II  ] mediated reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol, thereby demonstrating [Zn  II  ] assisted persulfidation of thiol in the presence of sulfane sulfur species.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8722;Co9S8 Core&#8211;Shell Nanoneedle Arrays by Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based nanomaterials for catalysis: Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrays, vertically aligned on carbon cloth (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) were prepared in&#8197;situ by calcining a Ce&#8722;Co(CO3)0.5OH@CC precursor. The Ce&#8208;incorporated Co9S8 active component and core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrayed architecture give Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC a refigured electronic configuration, highly exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels. Benefitting from these dual electronic and architectural advantages, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and selectivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
An dual electronic and architectural engineering strategy is a good way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Here, a Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) supported on a carbon cloth has been designed and developed to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Profiting from valance alternative Ce doping, a fine core&#8211;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion channels; together, these afford a favorable catalyzed OER. Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable performance in the OER in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242&#8197;mV to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the OER; this is 70&#8197;mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. Good stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100&#8201;% Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrated into a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability, thus demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.

         <title>Cobalt Complexes Supported by Phosphinoquinoline Ligands for the Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinoquinoline cobalt(II) complexes were used for the hydrosilylation of ketones. The diisopropylphosphino containing bisliganded complex was the most efficient allowing the transformation of variously substituted aliphatic or aromatic ketones at low catalyst loading and under mild conditions. The involvement of a Co&#8722;H complex as the active species was experimentally ascertained.







Abstract
P,N phosphinoquinoline based ligands differing by the nature of the phosphorus substituent (iPr, Ph) were employed to synthesize a series of cobalt(II) complexes ([LCoBr2], [L2CoBr](PF6) and [L&#8217;2CoBr](PF6)). The latter were obtained in high yield and characterized among others by X&#8208;ray analysis and elemental analysis. Complex [L2CoBr](PF6) showed a very good catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of various ketones. The catalysis proceeds at a low catalytic loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with only 1 equivalent of Ph2SiH2 in mild conditions and was efficient with aliphatic or aromatic ketones giving moderate to excellent yields of the corresponding silylated ether.

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bigger the better! Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which is not explainable by the electronegativity, results from the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;*C=S and &#960;*C=Se orbitals than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;*C=O orbital. The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen np and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8208;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, neither the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide's hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Design of Na&#8208;ion Superionic Conductors: Interstitial&#8208;Based Na Diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are usually based on vacancies of diffusing ions to enhance diffusivity. NaCuZrS3 with a post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure exhibits an interstitial&#8208;based Na ion diffusion mechanism. The low diffusion barriers of the order of 0.22&#8197;eV in the two &#8208; dimensional interlayer channels suggest a new class of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors for further exploration. Doping by trivalent ions (such as La) on Zr sites could help introduce Na interstitials.







Abstract
In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3, consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22&#8197;eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenothiazine derivatives were well predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and showed high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism (MC). All the derivatives exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and triplet&#8208;related dual emission (DEM) characters.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for the rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, a facile synthetic procedure, and a good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt;100&#8197;nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and emit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli gives them promise for applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular conductance of radical&#8208;substituted molecular wire was evaluated by STM apparent&#8208;height measurement compared with a non&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted wire. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has a 3.2&#8208;fold larger conductance. Although only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to exist on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Matsuda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104242).

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by the Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual Lewis acidity of &#947;&#8208;alumina is reported to enable rapid &#960;&#8208;extension of readily available building blocks through the tandem activation of &#8220;soft&#8221; triple C&#8722;C bonds and hard C&#8722;F bonds. The reaction gives facile access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and geodesic carbon nanoribbon fragments.







Abstract
We have discovered a dual (i.&#8201;e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through the activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8722;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces an acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes through three&#8208;point annulation of the 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluorophenyl)naphthalene moiety. The versatility of the developed method was demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>

The G&#228;nseliesel showcases the scientific magic in G&#246;ttingen! Scientific magic on the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine helps the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring transition state. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200648).

         <title>Chiral fibers formation upon assembly of tetraphenylalanine peptide conjugated to a PNA dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules such as peptides, nucleic acids or their analogues affords supramolecular objects, exhibiting structures and physical properties dependent on the amino&#8208;acid or nucleobase composition. Conjugation of the peptide diphenylalanine (FF) to peptide nucleic acids triggers formation of self&#8208;assembled structures, mainly stabilized by interactions between FF. In this work we report formation of homogeneous chiral fibers upon self&#8208;assembly of the hybrid composed of the tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer adenine&#8208;thymine (at). In this case nucleobases seem to play a key role in determining the morphology and chirality of the fibers. When the PNA &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by guanine&#8208;cytosine dimer &#8220;gc&#8221;, disordered structures are observed. Spectroscopic characterization of the self&#8208;assembled hybrids, along with AFM and SEM studies is reported. Finally, a structural model consistent with the experimental evidences has also been obtained, showing how the building blocks of 4Fat arrange to give helical fibers.</dc:description>

         <title>New Frame for a Classic System: Exploring the Reactivity of B&#8208;connected Carboranylphosphines in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The primary phosphines MesPH  2  and  t  &#8208;BuPH  2  react with 9&#8208;iodo&#8208;  m  &#8208;carborane yielding B9&#8208;connected secondary carboranylphosphines 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR, R = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  (Mes) (  1a  ),  t&#8208;  Bu (  1b  )). Addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) to  1a,b  resulted in the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BF(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  2a,b  ) through nucleophilic  para  substitution of a C  6  F  5  ring followed by fluoride transfer to boron. Further reaction with Me  2  SiHCl prompted an H&#8211;F exchange yielding the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BH(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  3a,b  ). The reaction of  2a,b  with one equivalent of R&#8217;MgBr (R&#8217; = Me, Ph) gave the extremely water&#8208;sensitive frustrated Lewis pairs 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )B(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  4a,b  ). Hydrolysis of the B&#8211;C6F4  bond in  4a,b  gave the first tertiary  B  &#8208;carboranyl phosphines with three distinct substituents, 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9  &#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4H) (5a,b). Deprotonation of the zwitterionic compounds  2a,b  and  3a,b  resulted in the formation of anionic phosphines [1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4)BX(C6F5)2]&#8208;  [DMSOH]  +  (R = Mes, X = F (  6a  ), R =  t  &#8208;Bu, X = F (  6b  ); R = Mes, X = H (  7a  ), R  =  t  &#8208;Bu, X = H (  7b  )). Reaction of  2a,b  with an excess of Grignard reagents resulted in addition of R&#8217; at the boron atom yielding the anions [1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BR&#8217;(C  6  F  5  )  2  ]  &#8208;  (R = Mes, R&#8217; = Me (  8a  ), R  =  t  &#8208;Bu, R&#8217; = Me (  8b  ); R = Mes, R&#8217; = Ph (  9a  ), R  =  t  &#8208;Bu, R&#8217; = Ph (  9b  )) with [MgBr(Et  2  O)  n  ]  +  as counterion. The ability of the zwitterionic compounds  3a,b  to hydrogenate imines as well as the Br&#248;nsted acidity of  3a  were investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate in Methanol Solutions by Mn Functionalized Electrodes in the Presence of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon cloth electrode modified by covalently attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst is used as cathode for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  in methanol solutions. Six different industrial amines are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in millimolar concentrations to deliver a series of new reactive system. While such absorbents were so far believed to provide a CO  2  reservoir and act as sacrificial proton source, we herein demonstrate that this role can be played by methanol, and that the adduct formed between CO  2  and the amine can act as an effector or inhibitor toward the catalyst, thereby enhancing or reducing the production of formate. Pentamethyldiethylentriamine (  PMDETA),  identified as the best effector in our series, converts CO  2  in wet methanolic solution into bisammonium bicarbonate. Computational studies revealed that this adduct is responsible for a barrierless transformation of CO  2  to formate by the reduced form of the Mn catalyst covalently bonded to the electrode surface. As a consequence, selectivity can be switched on demand from CO to formate anion, and in the case of (  PMDETA  ) an impressive TON  HCOO&#8211;  of 2.8&#215;10  4  can be reached. This new valuable knowledge on an integrated capture and utilization system paves the way toward more efficient transformation of CO  2  into liquid fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Molecular Origins of Green BN&#8208;TADF Material Degradation and Device Stability via In&#8208;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron&#8208;nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;TADF). Herein, three highly&#8208;efficient green BN&#8208;TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQE max of 19%, BN&#8208;PhOCH 3 and BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQE max of 25.6% and 24.1%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT 50 ) are dramatically improved from 1.7 h of BN&#8208;PhOH to 4.4 h of BN&#8208;PhOCH 3 and 7.7 h of BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 without encapsulation. According to in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. We proposed the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN&#8208;TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN&#8208;TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.</dc:description>

Further, chlorinating the backbone of the NHC ring sees and even greater increase in reactivity. In the cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl electrophiles to secondary alkyl nucleophiles, making the N&#8208;aryl groups larger reduces the amount of&#160;b&#8208;hydride elimination leading to alkene byproducts and chlorinating the NHC core had an even greater effect, all but eliminating alkene formation. In this study involving the cross&#8208;coupling of&#160;1&#186;alkyl electrophiles and nucleophiles, a sharp and surprising reversal of all of the above trends was observed. Bulkier catalysts had generally slower rate of reaction and&#160;b&#8208;hydride elimination worsened leading to extensive amounts of alkene byproducts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)  2  &#11827;PbI  4  ] ( BA = n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA  +  ), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28 eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350 K and 460 K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365 nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52 %). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches</dc:description>

         <title>Deposition of Vertically Aligned Ag/Ag2S Nanoflakes on EGaIn Particles for Humidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles were prepared in an ultrasonication assisted galvanic replacement reaction, and were subsequently transformed into EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S by a partial sulfurization. A humidity sensor based on the EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed superior sensing response to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag due to the silver sulfide in the composites; two conduction mechanisms take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag2S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Removal of Nitrogenous Organic Micropollutants from Water by Using Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>

MOPping up micropollutants: A new pH&#8208;triggered pollutant&#8208;removal methodology that uses water&#8208;soluble metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as coordinative capturing agents removes nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water. The exohedral coordination positions in the MOP structure are harnessed to coordinatively sequester the coordinating pollutants, while the exposed surface carboxyl groups are used to control their solubility in water through acid/base reactions. Benzotriazole (BT), benzothiazole (BTZ), 1&#8208;napthylamine (NA) and isoquinoline (IQ) were selected to validate this methodology.







Abstract
Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein, we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of RhII&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility through acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.

         <title>Hierarchical Fibrous Honeycomb Ceramics with High Load Capability and Low Light&#8208;Off Temperature for the Next&#8208;Generation Auto Emissions Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D microarchitecture as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.

         <title>Reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation of a platinum(II) complex with vapochromic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vapochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation of a highly luminescent Pt(II) complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [Pt(CN)  2  (  t  Bu&#8208;impy)] (  t  Bu&#8208;impyH  +  = 1&#8208;  t  &#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazolium) was reported. The trihydrate form of the complex, that exhibits blue  3  MMLCT emission owing to weak Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions, changed its luminescence color from blue to yellowish&#8208;green upon the desorption of water molecules keeping the high emission quantum yield more than 0.6. Variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements revealed that the SCSC transformation proceeds reversibly by the release and reabsorption of water molecules changing the stacked structure slightly. As a result, the dynamics of vapor&#8208;induced SCSC transformation were elucidated that the anhydrous form returned to the original trihydrate form in a two&#8208;step process under a water vapor atmosphere. In addition, the Pt(II) complex exhibited a similar SCSC response accompanied by a luminescence color change in the presence of methanol vapor, while being inactive toward ethanol vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being mesoionic makes the difference: A diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties compared to a normal diselenolene is reported. Two stable redox states are accessible: a paramagnetic radical dianion and a diamagnetic monoanion. The ligand was used for the preparation of novel aluminum bis&#8208; and tris(diselenolene) complexes.







Abstract
Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties is described. A mesoionic diselenolene was prepared by selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, preparation of a hexacoordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons was achieved.

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer encapsulation strategy is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.







Abstract
As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1&#8197;C, the specific capacity is 1079&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains a low loss of 0.076&#8201;% per cycle within 500&#8197;cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.

         <title>Halogenation of the Hexaphosphabenzene Complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)]: Snapshots on the Reaction Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots on the halogenation of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P6 ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P6 unit degrades to an allylic P3 unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (1) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated. The iodination afforded the ionic complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;P3I3)][X] (X=I3&#8722;, I&#8722;) (2) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PI2)][I3] (3), while the reaction with PBr5 led to the complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2][Cp*MoBr4] (4) [(Cp*MoBr)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8208;P2Br3)] (5) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PBr2)(&#956;&#8208;PHBr)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2] (6). The reaction of 1 with the far stronger oxidizing agent PCl5 was followed via time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. One of the first intermediates detected at 193&#8197;K was [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2][PCl6] (8) which rearranges upon warming to [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2] (9), [(Cp*MoCl)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)] (10) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)][Cp*MoCl4] (11), which could be isolated at room temperature. All complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Snapshots on the halogenation&lt;/b&gt; of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; unit degrades to an allylic P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.

Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, the authors rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.







Abstract
Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;membered naphthalene&#8208;supported borete is investigated as a masked 1,4&#8208;dipolar donor&#8208;acceptor cyclobutane. Ring expansion reactions confirm such type of reactivity and afford complex cyclic structures including fused and spiro&#8208;type polycyclics.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete cyclo&#8208;iPr2N&#8208;BC10H6 reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)2 with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)2 and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford spiro&#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.

         <title>Renaissance of Topotactic Ion&#8208;Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic cation exchange on close&#8208;packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr1/2Ti1/2O3) as a nano&#8208;shell on BZT (BaZr1/2Ti1/2O3).







Abstract
Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing ns2 stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired ndx electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [&#8208;M&#8722;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]n, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of An Aluminosilicate POS Zeolite with Intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;Member&#8208;Ring Pore Channels by Using a Designed Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large and extra&#8208;large pore zeolites have been widely applied in industrial areas as catalysts, adsorbents, etc. Among them, silica and/or aluminosilicate zeolites have been attracted great attention due to their excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity. However, a great deal of zeolite structures are still not available in the form of silica and/or aluminosilicate. Herein, we report the synthesis of pure silica and aluminosilicate large&#8208;pore zeolites, denoted as NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14, respectively, by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). NUD&#8208;14 has an intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;member ring pore system, which is isostructural to the germanosilicate PUK&#8208;16 zeolite with a POS topology. The OSDAs can be completely removed from the framework by calcination. NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 possess excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities, superior to the germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities. The successful synthesis of NUD&#8208;14 consisting of a rare odd&#8208;membered ring pore structure may provide a platform for interesting size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of arylallenes by alkenylboranes, formed in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of alkynes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. This novel 1,2&#8208;carboboration and a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling were used for the synthesis of twenty new aryl substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers&#8217; borane, i.&#8201;e., HB(C6F5)2. The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.

This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted  cyclo  &#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman) as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the  in&#8208;situ  detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;R]. To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] (  3Et  &#8226;  ) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br&#8208;P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] (  2a  ) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the new persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existen&#173;ce of radicals in the course of the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] (  1  ) with bromoethane. Extensive DFT and coupled cluster calculations corroborate the experimental data for a radical mechanism in the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] with EtBr.

         <dc:description>Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge for measurements of Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6 kJ mol  &#8722;1  over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent pe  abs  H2O  &#8208; and the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the pH  abs  H2O  &#8208;value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling the straightforward comparability of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvent&#180;s redox potential scales. Thus, using the herein published Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured for example against ferrocene to the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate analogue of MEcPP, a key intermediate in the MEP pathway, has been synthesized. The target compound features a vinyl functionality in place of the natural methyl substituent. Potent irreversible inhibition towards GcpE (IspG) was observed. Introduction of a double bond allows conjugation in the putative reactive intermediates while entering enzymatic transformation. Unexpected covalent trapping could happen as consequential damage.







Abstract
IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighboring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we have shown that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition; this might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Resorcyclic Acid&#8208;Based AIEgens for Illuminating Endoplasmic Reticulum**
</title>

Illuminate ER: Two small molecules with &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid moiety were designed and synthesized having aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. These small molecules localized into the sub&#8208;cellular endoplasmic reticulum to light it up.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules, which showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1&#8197;h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.

         <title>Exploring the Biosynthetic Potential of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Methyltransferase Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TsrM is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme catalyzing methylation reactions from carbon&#8208;atoms to nucleophilic atoms making it a unique and versatile alkylating agent. TsrM is able to directly transfer methyl groups on the less reactive carbon atom of the indole ring and to install several methyl groups on its substrate. TsrM has thus unique properties among radical SAM enzymes by notably catalyzing non&#8208;radical reactions. (SAM: S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).







Abstract
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Several Key Factors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Splitting: Active Site Coordination Environment, Morphology Changes and Intermediates Identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;splitting has emerged as a promising alternative strategy to produce clean hydrogen fuel. However, current electrocatalytic water splitting suffers from sluggish kinetics, thus developing efficient electrocatalysts is crucial. Identifying reaction centers discloses the reaction mechanism and will undoubtedly facilitate the design and optimization of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts. This review summarizes several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface. The morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity. Specifically, in situ/ex situ electron microscopy techniques that used for the characterization of catalytic sites, and spectroscopy techniques that used to detect active intermediates at the molecular level are highlighted. In addition, several perspectives, such as the development of new in&#8208;situ techniques and electrokinetic analysis methods, are emphasized to shed light on future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable V&#8208;Shaped Bifunctional Quinone Methide Precursors as a New Class of Selective G&#8208;quadruplex Alkylating Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining the selectivity of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands with the spatial and temporal control of photochemistry is an emerging strategy to elucidate the biological relevance of these structures. In this work, we developed six novel V&#8208;shaped G4 ligands that can, upon irradiation, form stable covalent adducts with G4 structures via the reactive intermediate, quinone methide (QM). We thoroughly investigated the photochemical properties of the ligands and their ability to generate QMs. Subsequently, we analysed their specificity for various topologies of G4 and discovered a preferential binding towards the human telomeric sequence. Finally, we tested the ligand ability to act as photochemical alkylating agents, identifying the covalent adducts with G4 structures. This work introduces a novel molecular tool in the chemical biology toolkit for G4s.</dc:description>

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (  7  ), and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (  4  ) (&#981; ~ 100%, solid state at 20&#176;C). For asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77 K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the catalytic effect of ionization on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and acrylaldehyde using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Removal of an electron from the dienophile, acrylaldehyde, significantly accelerates the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and shifts the reaction mechanism from concerted asynchronous for the neutral Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to stepwise for the radical&#8208;cation Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile&#8217;s occupied p&#8208;orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical&#8208;cation dienophile to engage in an additional three&#8208;electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of triplet excited states in two&#8208;component systems for high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past several years have witnessed tremendous development of novel chemical structures, new design strategies and intriguing applications in the field of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic afterglow materials. This review focuses on recent advancements of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials obtained by two&#8208;component design strategies such as dopant&#8208;matrix strategy, donor&#8208;acceptor strategy, sensitization and energy transfer strategy. Based on some cutting&#8208;edge studies, organic afterglow efficiency has been largely improved, exceeding 90% in several cases. Organic afterglow durations reach tens of seconds in phosphorescence systems and hours in donor&#8208;acceptor systems. Organic afterglow brightness outcompetes some inorganic afterglow materials at the first several seconds after ceasing excitation source. Organic afterglow colors cover the whole visible regions and extend to near&#8208;infrared regions with respectful afterglow efficiency. On the basis of these achievements, researchers demonstrate promising applications of organic afterglow materials in diverse fields, which has also been reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: Versatile Anticancer Tools with Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer agents with high efficacy against 14&#8197;different brain cancer cell lines derived from glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers. The IC50 values reach concentrations as low as 730&#8197;nM. Furthermore, these versatile and tunable agents exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties giving rise to potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to modify their electronic distribution, endow them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. In particular, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show antiproliferative properties in 14&#8197;cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values as low as 0.73&#8197;&#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with their photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (  NI&#8208;PXZ  ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has luminescence lifetime of 16.4 ns (99.2%)/17.0 &#956;s (0.80%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (  ca.  2.02 &#8764; 2.72 ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (  &#964;  CR  = 10.3 ps in acetonitrile,  vs  . 1.83 ns in toluene, 7.81 ns in  n  &#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in  n  &#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet mixed local excited state (  3  LE) and charge separated state (  3  CS), the lifetime is 15.4 &#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat  3  CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226 ns and 142 ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged  3  LE/  3  CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |  D  | and |  E  | parameters of 1484 MHz and 109 MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native  3  NI state (2475 and 135 MHz). It's rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying  3  LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this  3  LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse ISC in TADF system.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole Editing Enabled by HFIP&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Switch Reactions of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Hydroxyindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We found the novel reactivity of hemiaminal as a precursor for indole editing at the multi&#8208;site. The HFIP&#8208;promoted indole editing of indoline hemiaminals affords 2&#8208;arylindoles through a ring&#8208;switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a cyclic hemiaminal as an &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde surrogate under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance. The utility of this indole editing is presented through the one&#8208;pot protocol and the synthesis of isocryptolepine.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Heterocyclic Carbon&#8208;Boron Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaryl boronic acids and esters are extremely important and valuable intermediates because of their wide application in the synthesis of marketed drugs and bioactive compounds. Over the last couple of decades, the construction of highly important heteroaryl carbon&#8208;boron bonds has created huge attention. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols are more green, less sensitive to air and moisture, and also economically advantageous over the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based protocols. The transition metal&#8208;free C&#8208;H borylation of heteroarenes and C&#8208;X (X = halogen) borylation of heteroaryl halides represents an excellent approach for their synthesis. Also, various cyclization and alkyne activation protocols have been recently established for their synthesis. The goal of this review article is to summarize the existing literature and the current state of the art for transition metal&#8208;free synthesis of heteroaryl boronic acid and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable chromophore, the diiminoguanidinium group can be used as the base for an anion receptor based. Like the yin&#8208;yang (dark&#8211;light) relationship between the Moon and the Sun, the E,E and Z,Z photoisomers of the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium receptor have opposite binding behaviors towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion. The open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in the dark, through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off, thereby ejecting the bound sulfate anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;A. Moyer, R. Custelcean and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200719).

         <title>Disclosing Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes as One&#8208;Electron Reductants: Synthesis of Acyclic(Amino)(Aryl)Carbene&#8208;Based Kekul&#233; Diradicaloids</title>

CAAC donates electron and acts as reductant: Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) CAAC donates one electron during the formation of transient radical&#8208;cation evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, the one electron&#8208;reductant property of the disclosed CAAC was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) to be one&#8208;electron reductants under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. The disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate CAACs to be potent organic reductants. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAAC donates electron and acts as reductant&lt;/b&gt;: Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) CAAC donates one electron during the formation of transient radical-cation evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, the one electron-reductant property of the disclosed CAAC was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene-based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene-based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable-temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the crystalline state of sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) both twisted and folded carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds coexist. FAEs exhibit various absorption and emission colors from yellow to orange and from orange to dark red, just like beautiful autumn leaves. These color differences correspond to the multiple energetically close metastable conformations of the FAEs, which differ in the twist and fold angles of the C=C bond and the dihedral angle of the aryl unit relative to the C=C bond. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, T. Kubo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200286).

         <title>Lipid A mimetics based on unnatural disaccharide scaffold as potent TLR4 agonists for prospective immunotherapeutics and adjuvants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TLR4 is a key pattern recognition receptor that can sense pathogen&#8208; and danger&#8208; associated molecular patterns to activate the downstream signaling pathways which results in the upregulation of transcription factors and expression of interferons and cytokines to mediate protective pro&#8208;inflammatory responses involved in immune defense. Bacterial lipid A is the primary TLR4 ligand with very complex, species&#8208;specific, and barely predictable structure&#8208;activity relationships. Given that therapeutic targeting of TLR4 is an emerging tool for management of a variety of human diseases, the development of novel TLR4 activating biomolecules other than lipid A is of vast importance. We report on design, chemical synthesis and immunobiology of novel glycan&#8208;based lipid A&#8208;mimicking molecules that can activate human and murine TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling with picomolar affinity. Exploiting crystal structure &#8208; based design we have created novel disaccharide lipid A mimetics (DLAMs) where the inherently flexible &#946;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked diglucosamine backbone of lipid A is exchanged with a conformationally restrained non&#8208;reducing &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#180;)&#946;GlcN scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging  &#946;,&#946;  &#8208;1,1&#180; glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Divergent streamlined synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;linked diglucosamine&#8208;derived glycolipids entailing multiple long&#8208;chain (  R  )&#8208;3&#8208;  O  &#8208;acyloxyacyl residues and up two three phosphate groups was developed. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape and conformational rigidity of unnatural  &#946;,&#946;  &#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;linked diglucosamine combined with carefully optimized phosphorylation and acylation pattern ensured efficient induction of the TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling in a species&#8208;independent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase peptide modification via deaminative photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond formation using Katritzky salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Two&#8208;Dimensional Trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based Dion&#8722;Jacobson Hybrid Perovskite toward High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr3  are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic&#8208;layer numbers (n) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (n = 2) CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (n &gt; 2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3  motif, a new Q&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr  3  &#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10  (1, 4&#8208;AMP  2+  = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n = 3), is obtained. Excitingly,  1  exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single&#8208;layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit large on/off ratio (&gt; 10  3  ), high photodetectivity (6.5 &#215; 10&#160;  10  Jones) and fast response speed (193 &#956;s). As far as we know,  1  is the first Q&#8208;2D CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites with high n numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependant fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions,  &#960;  +  &#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step synthesis of less accessible spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9'&#8208;fluorene] compounds from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluoropyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, which serves as a potent precursor for outstandingly electrophilic Tf  2  C=CH  2  , has been developed. This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of  gem  &#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and Tf  2  C=CH  2  followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP). Besides, on the basis of the chameleonic reactivity of sulfone functionality, several derivatisations of triflylated spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9'&#8208;fluorene] products have been successfully achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the  P  6  1  chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air stable crystalline form readily obtained from a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH  &#8230;  &#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows a breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and reuptake of water inside the chiral channel, under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively in biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and a total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust method for the selective labelling of peptides via manganese(I) catalysis was devised to achieve the C&#8208;2 alkenylation of tryptophan containing peptides with 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes. The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity. This approach unravels a promising tool for the assembly of o&#8208;carborane with structurally complex peptides of relevance to applications in boron neutron capture therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;X Bond Activation by Palladium:&#160; Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8211;H and C(n&#176;)&#8211;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H 3 C&#8211; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH 3 H 2 C&#8211; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH 3 ) 2 HC&#8211; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH 3 ) 3 C&#8211; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. We pinpoint the effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents at the C&#8211;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8211;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bond activation. The C&#8211;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8211;X bond. For the more congested C&#8211;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8211;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The C&#8211;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8211;H and C(n&#176;)&#8211;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H 3 C&#8211; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH 3 H 2 C&#8211; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH 3 ) 2 HC&#8211; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH 3 ) 3 C&#8211; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion-corrected density functional theory at ZORA-BLYP-D3(BJ)/TZ2P. We pinpoint the effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents at the C&#8211;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8211;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)- and X-group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bond activation. The C&#8211;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8211;X bond. For the more congested C&#8211;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8211;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inactivation of competitive decay channels leads to enhanced coumarin photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of photolabile protecting groups, it is of high interest to selectively modify photochemical properties with structural changes as simple as possible. In this work, we want to adopt the knowledge of fluorophore optimization and use it to design new coumarin&#8208; based photocages. We selectively modulated the photolysis efficiency by inactivating competitive decay channels, such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) or hydogen&#8208;bonding and demonstrated the photolytic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 led to a significant increase in the uncaging cross section that can be further improved by the simple addition of a double bond. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we gained insights into the underlying solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical dynamics. The chromophores presented here are excellently suited as new photocages in the visible wavelength range due to their simple synthesis and their superior photochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticancer Aminoferrocene Derivatives Inducing Production of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual aminoferrocene (AF) agent (3&#8201;d) is reported, which does not react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in contrast to usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g., 3&#8201;b) and exhibits excellent anticancer effects in a variety of cancer cells and in a murine cancer Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) model. The mode of action relies on the increase of the level of mitochondrial ROS (mROS), whereas usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g. 3&#8201;b) do not affect mROS.







Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficient mitochondria are two weak points of cancer cells. Their simultaneous targeting is a valid therapeutic strategy to design highly potent anticancer drugs. The remaining challenge is to limit the drug effects to cancer cells without affecting normal ones. We have previously developed three aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based derivatives, which are activated in the presence of elevated levels of ROS present in cancer cells with formation of electron&#8208;rich compounds able to generate ROS and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). All of them exhibit important drawbacks including either low efficacy or high unspecific toxicity that prevents their application in&#8197;vivo up to date. Herein we describe unusual AF&#8208;derivatives lacking these drawbacks. These compounds act via an alternative mechanism: they are chemically stable in the presence of ROS, generate mitochondrial ROS in cancer cells, but not normal cells and exhibit anticancer effect in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly diverse pyridylated diarylmethanes are rapidly synthesized in metal&#8208;free process mediated by B2pin2/4&#8208;cyanopyridine system. In this reaction, the pyridine&#8208;boryl radical addition to C=O bond of p&#8208;QMs 1 promotes the generation of diarylmethane radicals, which are then coupled with pyridine&#8208;boryl radicals to obtain the desired products 3. The utility of the method was highlighted by biological activity identification.







Abstract
Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs. 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3&#8201;v was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole&#8208;substituted tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical ligands (L1 and L2) were synthesized in a facile way. They are stable and can be used to construct crystalline 1D and 2D open&#8208;shell coordination polymers (CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2) with cobalt(II) ions. Both polymers show antiferromagnetic interaction between carbon&#8208;centered radicals and the high&#8208;spin Co(II) ions.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interactions, but there are only a very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such a purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands L1 and L2 with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. Coordination of L1 and L2 with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208; (CoCP&#8208;1) and two&#8208;dimensional (CoCP&#8208;2) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic cobalt(II) ions and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of a metal&#8211;radical approach toward magnetic materials.

         <title>Orthogonalization of Polyaryl Linkers as a Route to More Porous Phosphonate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Orthogonalization of components inhibits efficient packing, whether of bagels or polyaryl linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). This strategy was applied to polyphosphonate linkers to generate six new MOF structures (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39). Ba, Sr, Mg, Zn and two Ca structures were obtained from a new trigonal linker with orthogonal peripheral aryl rings to inhibit efficient packing. The structures are discussed considering their porosity, stability and selective sorption of gases.







Abstract
The coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials often self&#8208;assemble as well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity, as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we report a multistep synthesis of a novel aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker with an orthogonalized ligand core, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2) designed to form more open structures. A series of crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8208;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9&#215;10.1&#8197;&#197;2 square channels. The stability of all structures was tested, and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), was found to retain its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH&#8197;3&#8211;11.

&lt;p&gt;The coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal-phosphonate materials often self-assemble as well-packed structures with minimal porosity, as efficient inter-ligand packing is enabled. Here, we report a multistep synthesis of a novel aryl-phosphonate linker with an orthogonalized ligand core, 1,3,5-tris(4&#8217;-phosphonophenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2) designed to form more open structures. A series of crystalline metal-phosphonate frameworks (CALF-35 to -39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid-state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 packs in a parallel-offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal-organic frameworks (CALF-35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L2 forms four new structures.
