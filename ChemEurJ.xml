         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Alcohols to &#946;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Vinylsulfones by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral secondary alcohols, serving as essential structural motifs, hold significant potential for diverse applications. The exploration of effective synthetic strategies toward these compounds is both attractive and challenging. Herein, we present an asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael reaction involving aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles and &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl vinylsulfones catalyzed by bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS), achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 98% ee). Additionally, a sequential process including asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael and debenzylation, facilitated by BPS/Lewis acid cooperation, was revealed for synthesizing diverse chiral secondary alcohol compounds in high yields (81&#8208;88%) with consistent stereoselectivities. Furthermore, mechanistic explorations and subsequent results unveiled that the enantioselectivity originates from hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair interactions between the BPS catalyst and the substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Fusion Elevates the Electronic Mobility of Azabenzannulated Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The backwardness of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors still exists compared with the p&#8208;type counterparts. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is of great importance for organic electronic devices and their integrated circuits. In recent years, azabenzannulated perylene diimide (PDI), as one of immense bay&#8208;region&#8208;annulated PDI derivatives, has drawn considerable attentions. However, the electronic mobilities of azabenzannulated PDI derivatives are barely satisfactory. In this contribution, the peripheral benzene ring in azabenzannulated PDI 2 was fused to the ortho position by intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. This endows the resultant azabenzannulated PDI 4 a planar configuration as well as electron deficient pentagonal ring. As a result, the electronic mobility of 4 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the nonfused azabenzannulated PDI 2. This work shall pave a new avenue in elevating the performance of azabenzannulated PDI in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>RuPHOX&#8208;Ru Catalyzed Asymmetric Cascade Hydrogenation of 3&#8208;Substituted Chromones for the Synthesis of Corresponding Chiral Chromanols&#8203;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient RuPHOX&#8208;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr). Control reactions and deuterium labelling experiments revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution process occurs during the subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O double bond, which is responsible for the high performance of the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation. The resulting products allow for several transformations and it was shown that the protocol provides a practical and alternative strategy for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Metal&#8208;organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes, which are recognized as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platforms applied in various separation processes, have attracted widespread attention. Nonetheless, to overcome the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, which is crucial for achieving efficient separation, it is important to rationally design and manipulate MOF membrane structure. Given remarkable advances in the past decade, a timely summary of recent advancement in this field has become indispensable. This review introduces major strategies for fabricating oriented MOF membranes, including in situ growth, contra&#8208;diffusion method, interface&#8208;assisted approach, and laminated nanosheet assembly. New insights into their updated progress and potential are elucidated. Of particular note, recent development and emerging applications of oriented MOF membranes, illustrating their potential to address environmental and energy challenges, are highlighted. Finally, remaining challenges facing their bath production and practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8722;H Functionalization?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building on the pioneering works using imines to form metallacycle with transition metals, recent developments have realized the potential of using transient directing group (TDG) to direct C&#8722;H functionalization. This article discusses factors defining a transient directing group and strategies to achieve catalytic processes with low directing group loading by highlighting recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometallation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient. A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically in&#8197;situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal. This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8722;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8722;H functionalization with transition metals.

         <title>Mesoporous Metal Nanomaterials: Developments and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept, we primarily summarized the design and synthetic strategies of mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs), aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. MPMNs successfully make up for the unsatisfactory of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials by exposing more active sites and providing channels through interconnected pores for efficient mass transfer.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of MPMNs during prolonged usage. This concept focus on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation in Covalently Linked BODIPY&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of bodipy&#8208;quinone dyads and their photoinduced charge separation is reported using a complementary set of experimental and theoretical methods. Dyads feature an additional alkyne group as potential anchor group for further functionalizations, featuring electron storing or catalytic behaviors.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced charge separation and directional charge transfer are cornerstones for artificial photosynthesis and the generation of solar fuels. Here, we report synthetic access to a series of noble metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on bodipy light&#8208;absorbers and redox&#8208;active quinone/anthraquinone charge storage sites. Peripheral functionalization of the quinone/anthraquinone units with alkynes primes the dyads for integration into a range of light&#8208;harvesting systems, e.&#8201;g., by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions (CLICK chemistry) or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Initial photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal the principal processes during the light&#8208;induced charge separation in the reported dyads.

The asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone is being disclosed. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone produce (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using two pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalysts, demonstrating excellent stereospecificity, high yields, and enantioselectivity. The resulting phthalan can undergo conversion into corresponding phthalides followed by oxidation.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael (IOM) reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone by the formation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalyst. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone provide (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran with excellent stereospecificity. In general, excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee) were obtained. Furthermore, the resulting 1,1&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran or phthalan was converted to corresponding chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides without losing the enantioselectivity. This methodology provides the core moiety of the (S)&#8208;citalopram drug.

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced via heterogeneous pairwise parahydrogen addition to ethyl vinyl ether (a.k.a. vinamar) anesthetic gas and employed for a pilot feasibility demonstration to record sub&#8208;second 2D ventilation MRI of excised rabbit lungs on a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications to the scanner's hardware or software.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogeneous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2&#215;2&#8197;mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35&#8197;T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.

         <title>In2Q2: A New Entry of 16&#8208;Membered Tetraazamacrocycle Concatenating Indole and Quinoline Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting properties were revealed.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Binuclear Copper(I) Alkynyl Complexes with Cuprophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>

Binuclear copper(I) alkynyl complexes with ultrashort Cu&#8722;Cu distance are designed and synthesized, which show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL). The cuprophilic interactions can promote spin&#8208;orbit coupling and ligand engineering can achieve adjustable luminescence, which provide design ideas for the building of stimuli&#8208;responsive Cu(I)&#8208;based TADF materials.







Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been conceived to be promising candidates for display and lighting applications because of their multifarious structures and strong photoluminescence. Herein a string of binuclear Cu(I) complexes bearing pronounced cuprophilic interactions have been designed and synthesized. [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)2] (1&#8201;a) and [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;PPXZ)2] (1&#8201;b) display photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 67&#8201;% in doped films and solid states via TADF and exhibit reversible bicolor luminescence switching upon mechanical stimuli. Computational studies manifest that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer predominant transitions ensure a small energy splitting (&#916;EST) between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and cuprophilic interactions promote the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), favoring the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;based TADF materials.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application of Colloidal and Supported Manganese Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal manganese nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and characterized, with the reaction parameters optimized to yield small and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Immobilization of the manganese NPs on a supported ionic liquid phase and application in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones showed that the oxidation state of manganese strongly influences the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Colloidal and supported manganese nanoparticles were synthesized following an organometallic approach and applied in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of aldehydes and ketones. Reaction parameters for the preparation of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) were optimized to yield small (2&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm) and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Manganese NPs were further immobilized on an imidazolium&#8208;based supported ionic phase (SILP) and characterized to evaluate NP size, metal loading, and oxidation states. Oxidation of the Mn NPs by the support was observed resulting in an average formal oxidation state of +2.5. The MnOx@SILP material showed promising performance in the CTH of aldehydes and ketones using 2&#8208;propanol as a hydrogen donor, outperforming previously reported Mn NPs&#8208;based CTH catalysts in terms of metal loading&#8208;normalized turnover numbers. Interestingly, MnOx@SILP were found to lose activity upon air exposure, which correlates with an additional increase in the average oxidation state of Mn as revealed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic studies.

         <title>Constructing Hollow Microcubes SnS2 as Negative Electrode for Sodium&#8208;ion and Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change.







Abstract
Sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs and KIBs) are considered the most promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy storage fields. Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high&#8208;rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly. The in operando and ex&#8208;situ characterization provide a piece of direct evidence to clarify the storage mechanism of such conversion&#8208;alloying type negative electrode materials.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Capturing N&#8208;Methylbenzene Sulfonamide&#8208;Phenothiazine Incorporating Strong Electron Acceptor Push&#8208;Pull Systems: Photochemical Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of symmetrical and asymmetrical ynamide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores exhibiting strong intramolecular charge transfer have been designed, synthesized, and insight into their ultrafast carrier dynamics is investigated. Broadly tunable absorption extending even in the near&#8208;infrared region coupled with novel excited state dynamical processes brightens their prospect of utilization in advanced photonic applications.







Abstract
Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano's condition followed by [2+2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85&#8201;%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ) with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. The electrochemical properties reveal that reduction potentials of 3 and 6 are lower than those of 2 and 5, suggesting DCNQ imparts more on the electronic properties and hence largely contributes to the stabilization of LUMO energy levels than TCBD, in line with theoretical observations. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated by femtosecond transient absorption studies to identify their spectral characteristics and target analysis further provides information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles. The key findings obtained here related to excited state dynamical processes of these newly synthesized systems are believed to be significant in advancing their prospect of utilization in solar energy conversion and related photonic applications.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here: We proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of macrocyclic polyethylene glycol sulfite (PEG&#8208;MCSi), which is a versatile building block for many PEG derivatives. In contrast to batch reactions, continuous production for this intermediate proves to be stable in terms of yield over a long course, and is therefore suitable for bulk production of PEG&#8208;MCSi.







Abstract
Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4&#8197;parallel runs for up to 64&#8197;h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Insert text for Table of Contents here: We proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of macrocyclic polyethylene glycol sulfite (PEG-MCSi), which is a versatile building block for many PEG derivatives. In contrast to batch reactions, continuous production for this intermediate proves to be stable in terms of yield over a long course, and is therefore suitable for bulk production of PEG-MCSi.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Eosin Y&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Organic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed Eosin Y was prepared by radical photopolymerization to obtain new heterogeneous photocatalyst with a well&#8208;defined morphology. Taking advantage of the 3D&#8208;printing technology, the heterogeneous EY was designed to fit around the magnetic stirring bar to facilitate both implementation of various organic transformations and catalyst recovery. This very robust photocatalyst is easily recycled and the efficiency was still very high even after 8 reactions.







Abstract
Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D&#8208;printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven para&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by Activation of Alkyl Halides without Sacrificial Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved with alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner. Under mild electrolytic conditions, a variety of alkylated arenes are obtained in one step through the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Notably, the reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes.







Abstract
With alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner, an electrochemically driven strategy for para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved to access diverse alkylated arenes in one step. The reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes, achieving the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds under mild electrolytic conditions. The utility of this protocol is reflected in high site selectivity, broad substrate scope, and scalable.

         <title>Internal Vanadium Doping and External Modification Design of P2&#8208;Type Layered Mn&#8208;Based Oxides as Competitive Cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

We propose a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F, featuring synergistic modification through doping and coating. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8211;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.

Stable main&#8208;group element&#8208;centered radicals have attracted tremendous attention. We report here the synthesis and molecular structures of both an arsenic&#8208;centered radical anion and a radical cation. In addition, the synthesis of base&#8208;coordinated and base&#8208;free diarsene dications is presented.







Abstract
Diarsene [L(MeO)GaAs]2 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, 4) reacts with MeOTf and MeNHC (MeNHC=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetra&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to the diarsene [L(TfO)GaAs]2 (5) and the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L] (6). The NHC&#8208;coordination results in an inversion of the redox properties of the diarsene 4, which shows only a reversible reduction event at E1/2=&#8722;2.06&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1, whereas the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene 6 shows a reversible oxidation event at E1/2=&#8722;1.31&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1. Single electron transfer reactions of 4 and 6 yielded [K[2.2.2.]cryp][L(MeO)GaAs]2 (8) and [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)&#8208;Ga(OMe)L][B(C6F5)4] (9) containing the radical anion [L(MeO)GaAs]2&#8901;&#8722; (8&#8901;&#8722;) and the NHC&#8208;coordinated radical cation [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L]&#8901;+ (9&#8901;+), respectively, while the salt&#8208;elimination reaction of the triflate&#8208;coordinated diarsene 5 with Na[B(C6F5)4] gave [LGaAs]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (11) containing the dication [LGaAs]22+ (112+). Compounds 1&#8211;11 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, EPR (8, 9), IR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). DFT calculations provided a detailed understanding of the electronic nature of the diarsenes (4, 6) and the radical ions (8&#8901;&#8722;, 9&#8901;+), respectively.

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular Grignard&#8208;Type Reaction of Vinyl Iodide&#8208;Carbonyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde is realized for the first time, which provides facile access to cyclic allylic alcohols with high level of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The key to success is the use of HCO2H as additive, which preferentially facilitates protonation of the involved secondary alkyloxyl&#8208;Pd(II) intermediate over the &#946;&#8208;H elimination.







Abstract
The insertion of carbonyl into C(sp2)&#8722;Pd(II) &#963;&#8208;bond (Grignard&#8208;type addition) was not established until the 1990s. While this elemental reaction has been well explored since then, its application in Pd(0) asymmetric catalysis remain elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8208;carbonyl in the presence of HCO2H additive, affording cyclic allylic alcohol with good to excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that besides serving as an efficient reductant, HCO2H is also capable of facilitating protonation of the involved secondary alkoxyl&#8208;Pd(II), thus completely suppressing the &#946;&#8208;H elimination. Moreover, no KIE was found in the competing reaction between vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde and 1&#8208;deuterated one, demonstrating the facile step of aldehyde insertion.

         <title>Exploring Spin&#8208;Orbit Effects in a [Cu6Tl]+ Nanocluster Featuring an Uncommon Tl&#8722;H Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Cu6Tl]+ cluster, [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf], exhibits a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction, as ascertained by 1H NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit (SO) effects mainly originating from the heavy Tl atom, which represent an important confirmation of SO effects in heavy element main group hydrides.







Abstract
Reaction of [CuH(PPh3)]6 with 1 equiv. of Tl(OTf) results in formation of [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf] ([1]OTf]), which can be isolated in good yields. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the presence of a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands of [1]+ includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the heavy Tl atom. This study provides valuable new insights into a rare class of metal hydrides, given that [1][OTf] is only the third isolable species reported to contain a Tl&#8722;H interaction.

We explore the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties of two urea&#8208;containing single core thiophene&#8208;capped diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives. The subtle differences in molecular design dictate the superior electronic properties of the lactam&#8208;functionalized analogue







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from noncovalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.

         <title>para&#8211;Phenylenediamine Dimer as a Redox&#8211;Active Guest for Supramolecular Systems</title>

Para&#8211;phenylenediamine dimers with the biphenyl centrepieces form supramolecular complexes with multiple units of &#945;/&#946;/&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins and/or cucurbit[7/8]urils. Several redox agents were tested for switching between fully reduced colourless and partially oxidised deep blue diradical forms. The reducing effect of some agents was selectively inhibited by complexation with cucurbit[7]uril.







Abstract
Redox&#8211;active components are highly valuable in the construction of molecular devices. We combined two p&#8208;phenylenediamines (p&#8208;PDA) with a biphenyl (BiPhe) unit to prepare a supramolecular guest 4 consisting of three binding sites for cucurbit[7/8]uril (CBn) and/or cyclodextrins (CD). Supramolecular properties of 4 were investigated using NMR, UV&#8208;vis, mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our analysis revealed that 4 forms higher&#8211;order host&#8211;guest complexes, wherein a CD unit occupies the central BiPhe site, secured by two CBn units at the terminal p&#8208;PDA sites. Additionally, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CD, a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex with &#947;&#8208;CD and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with CB7 and CB8 were identified. Through UV&#8208;vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of 4 are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised 4 from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by 4 render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.

         <title>Reversibly Tuning the Viscosity of Peptide&#8208;Based Solutions Using Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8211;switchable merocyanine photoacid has been used to induce reversible pH drops during the assembly of the modified dipeptide molecule 1ThNapFF. As the pH is decreased, protonation of 1ThNapFF leads to increased aggregation and increased viscosity. These reversible viscosity changes can be used to design systems where flow can be controlled in a non&#8211;invasive and localised way.







Abstract
Light can be used to design stimuli&#8211;responsive systems. We induce transient changes in the assembly of a low molecular weight gelator solution using a merocyanine photoacid. Through our approach, reversible viscosity changes can be achieved via irradiation, delivering systems where flow can be controlled non&#8208;invasively on demand.

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8211;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8211;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various naphthopyranones were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity. The synthesis was carried out using two building blocks, which were prepared from enantiomerically pure oxiranes and methyl acetoacetate and then reacted with each other to form naphthopyranones. Monomeric and dimeric naphthopyranones were synthesized and then a structure&#8211;activity relationship study was carried out.







Abstract
Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8211;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8211;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8211;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8211;Michael&#8211;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Rich Heterocycles Derived from a Phosphadiazonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a phosphadiazonium cation has been used to create functional heterocycles. DFT calculations confirm that the Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the generation of the unique photophysical and redox properties observed opening the door for the further development of new families of pnictogen&#8208;rich, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles.







Abstract
Heterocycles that pair main group elements and nitrogen are extremely important within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles research community. Compared to the vast number of boron&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, those that include phosphorus are less common. Furthermore, the use of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen triple bonds of any type to prepare such compounds is unprecedented. Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.

         <title>On Haptotropic Rearrangements of Diphosphene and Diarsene Ligands in Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of simple Lewis basic ligands L, such as MeCN or CO among others, results in a shift of the hapticity of the dipnictene ligand in titanocene dipnictene complexes Cp2Ti(Pn2R2) (Pn=P, As) from &#951;2 to &#951;1. While the starting complexes are TiIV species the &#951;1 complexes are best described as singlet biradicals with antiferromagnetically coupled [Cp2TiIII]&#8901;+&#8901; and [Pn2R2]&#8901;&#8722; fragments as verified by computational studies.







Abstract
Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#951;2 to &#951;1 rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp2Ti(Pn2Ar2) (Pn=P, As; Ar=2,4,6&#8208;Me3&#8208;C6H2, Mes; 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, Dip; 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L=MeCN, PMe3, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &#951;2 to &#951;1 and complexes of the general form Cp2Ti(L)(Pn2Ar2) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (via a &#960;&#8208;bond) [Cp2TiIII]&#8901;+ and [Pn2Ar2]&#8901;&#8722; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co&#8208;ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe3/MeCN (&#963;&#8208;donors) to CNAd/CO (&#963;&#8208;donors/&#960;&#8208;acceptors).

&lt;p&gt;Addition of simple Lewis basic ligands L, such as MeCN or CO among others, results in a shift of the hapticity of the dipnictene ligand in titanocene dipnictene complexes Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(Pn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (Pn=P, As) from &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. While the starting complexes are Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; species the &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are best described as singlet biradicals with antiferromagnetically coupled [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901; and [Pn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragments as verified by computational studies.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(Pn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (Pn=P, As; Ar=2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mes; 2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Dip; 2,4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L=MeCN, PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; and complexes of the general form Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(L)(Pn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bond) [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Pn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co-ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MeCN (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donors) to CNAd/CO (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donors/&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-acceptors).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One way or another! Our quantum chemical calculations show how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the backside SN2 pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual frontside SN2 substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles in substitution reactions with alkyl triflates.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical study revealed that high activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region of the free radical hybrid determine the regioselectivity of polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) electrochemical oxidation towards carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicenes. This work would pave the way for precise construction of heteroatom fused helical large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using direct splicing strategy from PAHs derivatives.







Abstract
Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.

Bring solid state chemistry into solution. Using a supramolecular assembly to mimic the coordination environment of [SiH6]2&#8722; in the solid&#8208;state, a molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex that is stable in solution is reported.







Abstract
The hypercoordinate [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is not stable in solution. Here, we report the room temperature, solution stable molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex, [{KCa(NON)(OEt2)}2][SiH6] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene)), where the [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is stabilised within a supramolecular assembly that mimics the solid&#8208;state environment of the anion in the lattice of K2SiH6. Solution&#8208;state reactivity of the complex towards carbon monoxide, benzaldehyde, azobenzene and acetonitrile is reported, yielding a range of reduction and C&#8722;C coupled products.

         <title>Front Cover: Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) (Chem. Eur. J. 25/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel continuous process is proposed for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetra(ethylene glycol), PEG4&#8208;MCSi, which is a precursor to the useful building block PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate, PEG4&#8208;MCS.

         <title>Emergent Properties in Chemistry &#8208; Relating Molecular Properties to Bulk Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain physico&#8208;chemical properties like density or color emerge only when a sufficient number of atoms or molecules are combined in a suitable way. By discussing various case studies, such as the liquidity of water, we here investigate the fundamental types of emergence in chemistry. Studying how properties emerge enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of these properties.







Abstract
Certain properties of an object only emerge when a sufficient number of those objects are present in a definite arrangement. For example, one or two water molecules cannot said to be in a liquid state, but a drop of water can be. This concept of emergence has been studied extensively, but only occasionally discussed explicitly in the context of chemistry. In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthetic strategies for 11 complicated natural products containing (di)benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif are reviewed as well as the synthetic studies on model compounds and analogs. The reaction types for the key cyclization step include Friedel&#8211;Crafts, aldol, and cascaded combination of similar processes.







Abstract
Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane is a cage&#8208;like unique motif containing a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane structure fused with at least one benzene ring. It is found in various natural products that exhibit structural complexities and important biological activities. The total synthesis of natural products possessing this challenging structure has received considerable attention, and great advances have been made in this field during the past 15&#8197;years. This review summarizes thus far achieved chemical syntheses and synthetic studies of natural compounds featuring the benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. It focuses on strategic approaches constructing the bridged structure, aiming to provide a useful reference for inspiring further advancements in strategies and total syntheses of natural products with such a framework.

         <title>Artificial Processive Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processive catalyst undergoes several rounds of catalysis before it is released from the substrate. The drawing shows possible ways (A&#8211;D) in which a synthetic catalyst can interact with the substrate to achieve processivity.







Abstract
Processive catalysts remain attached to a substrate and perform multiple rounds of catalysis. They are abundant in nature. This review highlights artificial processive catalytic systems, which can be divided into (A) catalytic rings that move along a polymer chain, (B) catalytic pores that hold polymer chains and decompose them, (C) catalysts that remain attached to and move around a cyclic substrate via supramolecular interactions, and (D) anchored catalysts that remain in contact with a substrate via multiple catalytic interactions (see frontispiece).

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini review article provides an overview on the advantages and versatility of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis. We will focuse on the application of HICs in glycosylation, oxidation, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.

         <title>From Criegee to Breslow: How &#960;&#8208;Donors Steer the Route of Olefin Ozonolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ozonolysis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins could lead to currently unknown urea O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates. However, our DFT computations predict that strongly polarized double bonds prefer to accept an oxygen atom from ozone rather than undergoing the usually encountered cycloaddition reaction. The product of this reaction is a precursor of the Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;bonds typically undergo cycloaddition with ozone, resulting in the release of much&#8208;noticed carbonyl O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates, lone&#8208;pairs of electrons tend to selectively accept a single oxygen atom from O3, producing singlet dioxygen. We questioned whether the introduction of potent electron&#8208;donating groups, akin to N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, could influence the reactivity of double bonds &#8211; shifting from cycloaddition to oxygen atom transfer or generating lesser&#8208;known, yet stabilized, donor&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates. Consequently, we conducted a comparative computational study using density functional theory on a series of model olefins with increasing polarity due to (asymmetric) &#960;&#8208;donor substitution. Reaction path computations indicate that highly polarized double bonds, instead of forming primary ozonides in their reaction with O3, exhibit a preference for accepting a single oxygen atom, resulting in a zwitterionic species formally identified as a carbene&#8208;carbonyl adduct. This previously unexplored reactivity potentially introduces aldehyde umpolung chemistry (Breslow intermediate) through olefin ozonolysis. Considering solvent effects implicitly reveals that increased solvent polarity further directs the trajectories toward a single oxygen atom transfer reactivity by stabilizing the zwitterionic character of the transition state. The competing modes of chemical reactivity can be explained by a bifurcation of the reaction valley in the post&#8208;transition state region.

         <title>Advances in the Continuous Flow Synthesis of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;Membered Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This short review summarises key developments for the synthesis of strained 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems exploiting continuous flow synthesis. These important carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic scaffolds are readily accessed via photochemical, electrochemical and temperature sensitive strategies.







Abstract
Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.

         <title>Formation of Peroxynitrite, [O&#8722;N&#8722;O&#8722;O]&#8722;, via a Cascade of Reactions between Ozonide and Ammonia</title>

         <dc:description>
[ONOO]&#8722; has been encountered along a cascade of reactions between KO3 and ammonia in the presents of a partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based cation. For the first time, high resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite ion have been obtained and single crystals were studied by Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report on an unexpected reaction between ammonia and potassium ozonide dissolved in liq. NH3 resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite, [ONOO]&#8722;, which exclusively happens in the presence of a specific partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based ammonium cation. High&#8208;resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite anion in cis&#8208;conformation have been obtained. We further studied this molecule anion by single crystal Raman spectroscopy. The cis and trans isomers of peroxynitrite were analysed computationally with respect to their relative energies, the cis&#8208;trans transition barrier and their decomposition pathways to the nitrate anion. By experimentally examining cations decorated with fluorine ligands to different degrees, we demonstrate that fluorine specific interactions play a crucial role in the unexpected formation of peroxynitrite and as a conspicuously structure directing factor for the underlying crystalline solid phases, exhibiting distinct micro&#8208;separations of fluorine and hydrogen enriched regions.

The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly.







Abstract
Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;&#8208;holes as halogen&#8208;bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side&#8208;arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self&#8208;aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod&#8208;like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.

Framework and polymeric nanoreactor have been regarded for improving cascade chemical reaction in the tumor microenvironment. Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzymes have been activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. In this review, we identify the significance of dual&#8208;enzyme cascade in the tumor microenvironment which regulated by ROS activity. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, ROS formation, including cascaded enzymes along with synergistic therapy.







Abstract
Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays an important role in evading tumor immunity and conferring resistance to immunotherapy. Nanomaterials targeting various immune components in the suppressive TIME can alter the tumor inhibition state, promote the therapeutic effect of anti&#8208;tumor drugs, and enhance anti&#8208;tumor efficacy In this review, we provided an overview of key briefly viewed the key components within the suppressive TIME and various nanoparticles designed to target these components for applications in cancer immunotherapy. Through comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of immune cells in sculpting anti&#8208;tumor immunity, next&#8208;generation nanoscale immunotherapies can be rationally designed to orchestrate a pro&#8208;immunogenic tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising results in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.

         <title>Tunable Optical Anisotropy in Rare&#8208;earth Borates with Flexible [BO3] Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borates have garnered a lot of attention in the realm of solid&#8208;state chemistry due to their remarkable characteristics, in which the synthesis of borates with isolated [BO3] by adding rare&#8208;earth elements is one of the main areas of structural design study. Five new mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates, Ba2ZnY2(BO3)4, KNa2Y(BO3)2, Li2CsY4(BO3)5, LiRb2Y(BO3)2, and RbCaY(BO3)2, have been discovered using the high&#8208;temperature solution approach. Isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations comprise their entire anionic framework, allowing for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081 under 1064 nm. In this study, we characterize the relative placements of their [BO3] groups and examine how their structure affects their characteristics. The origin of their considerable optical anisotropy has been proven theoretically. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates' anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction of C60 with methylammonium lead iodide perovskite surfaces: Unveiling the Role of C60 in Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the interaction between fullerene (C60) and perovskite surfaces is pivotal for advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior of C60 on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations. We explore various surface terminations and defect configurations to elucidate the influence of surface morphology on the C60&#8208;perovskite interaction, computing the adsorption energy and transfer of charge. Our results reveal distinct adsorption energies and charge transfer mechanisms for different surface terminations, shedding light on the role of surface defects in modifying the electronic structure and stability of perovskite materials. Furthermore, we provide insights into the potential of C60 to passivate surface defects, playing a relevant role in the surface reconstruction after the formation of defects. This comprehensive understanding of C60&#8208;perovskite interactions offers valuable guidelines about the role of fullerenes on surface structure and reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe early and recent advances in the fascinating field of combined magnetic and optical properties of inorganic coordination compounds and in particular of 3d&#8208;4f single molecule magnets. We cover various applied techniques which allow for the correlation of results obtained in the frequency and time domain in order to highlight the specific properties of these compounds and the future challenges towards multidimensional spectroscopic tools. An important point is to understand the details of the interplay of magnetic and optical properties through performing time&#8208;resolved studies in the presence of external fields especially magnetic ones. This will enable further exploration of this fundamental interactions i.e. the two components of electromagnetic radiation influencing optical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Natural light&#8208;responsive rhodopsins play a critical role in visual conversion, signal transduction, energy transmission, etc., which has aroused extensive interest in the past decade. Inspired by these gorgeous works of living beings, scientists have constructed various biomimetic light&#8208;responsive nanochannels to mimic the behaviors of rhodopsins. However, it is still challenging to build stimuli&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannels only regulated by visible light as the rhodopsins are always at the sub&#8208;nanometer level and regulated by visible light. Pillar[6]arenes have an open cavity of 6.7 &#197;, which can selectively recognize small organic molecules. They can be connected to ions of ammonium or carboxylate groups on the rims. Therefore, we designed and synthesized the amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived side chains of pillar[6]arenes with opposite charges. The sub&#8208;nanochannels were constructed through the electrostatic interaction of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived pillar[6]arenes. Then, the natural chromophore of the retinal with visible light&#8208;responsive performance was modified on the upper edge of the sub&#8208;nanochannel to realize the visible light switched on and off. Finally, we successfully constructed a visible light&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannel, providing a novel method for regulating the selective transport of energy&#8208;donating molecules of ATP.</dc:description>

Heterogeneous catalysts not only facilitate synergistic enhancement of distinct catalytic centers compared to their homogeneous counterparts, but also allow for the easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements in developing heterogeneous carriers, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and others, for synergistic catalytic reactions. The advantages of porous materials in heterogeneous catalysis originate from their ability to provide a high surface area, facilitate enhanced mass transport, offer a tunable chemical structure, ensure the stability of active species, and enable easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. Both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into suitable porous carriers to create heterogeneous dual photocatalysts for organic transformations. Notably, experimental evidence from reported cases has shown that the catalytic efficacy of heterogeneous catalysts often surpasses that of their homogeneous analogues. This enhanced performance is attributed to the proximity and confinement effects provided by the porous nature of the carriers. It is expected that porous carriers will provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse catalysts, thus exhibiting superior performance across a range of organic transformations and appealing prospect for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Coordination Chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalytic Sites by Ru Species to Accelerate the Polysulfide Conversion Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is compromised by the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and consequently the polysulfide redox shutting effect. Accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfide intermediates into sulfur or lithium sulfide through electrocatalysis has emerged as a root&#8208;cause solution. Co&#8208;N&#8208;C composite electrocatalyst is commonly used for this purpose. It is illustrated here that how the effectiveness can be improved by modulating the coordination chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites through introducing Ru species (RuCo&#8208;NC). The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8208;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8208;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Using Ru to modulate the electronic structure in the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C configuration and the additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8208;Nx species can manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with RuCo&#8208;NC can reduce the capacity fade rate from 0.11% per cycle without catalyst (initial capacity of 701 mAh g&#8208;1) to 0.054% per cycle (initial capacity of 1074 mAh g&#8208;1) over 400 cycles at 0.2 C rate. The results of this study provide the evidence for a feasible catalyst modification strategy for the polysulfide electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Indolines via Base&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;H Activation and Defluorinative C&#8211;N Coupling, with no Need for Transition&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syntheses of (partially) aromatic nitrogen heterocycles increasingly rely on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8211;C&#8208; and C&#8211;N&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we describe a different approach to the synthesis of indolines by a domino C(sp3)&#8211;H activation, 1,2&#8208;addition, and defluorinative SNAr&#8208;cyclization sequence to provide the target 1,2&#8208;diarylindolines (1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) from ortho&#8208;fluorinated methyl&#8208;arenes and N&#8208;aryl imines (benzylidene anilines) in a cyclocondensation that is mediated by potassium hexa&#173;methyl&#173;di&#173;silazide (KHMDS) as base exclusively. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process via C&#8211;H and C&#8211;F bond activation provides a one&#8208;step entry into a wide array of indoline scaffolds (43 examples, up to 96% yield). This privileged substructure is common in natural products and pharmaceuticals alike, and cannot be accessed by traditional condensation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Single Acyclic Phosphonate Nucleotide (ZNA) Modifications on DNA Duplex Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An acyclic phosphonate&#8208;linked nucleic acid backbone (ZNA) demonstrated the capability to support duplex formation and propagate genetic information in vivo, unveiling its potential for evolution into a synthetic genetic system (XNA). To determine the structural impact of such modification, modified Dickerson Drew DNA dodecamers (DDDs) were prepared by solid phase synthesis, each containing either an (R) or (S) isomeric form of a cytosine ZNA nucleotide. While the DDD is known to adopt a stable duplex, both duplex and hairpin forms were simultaneously observed for both modified oligonucleotides by NMR spectroscopy over a broad temperature range (5&#8211;65 &#176;C). Diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments allowed to separate duplex and hairpin signals based on the different diffusion constants of both conformational states. For the oligomer containing (R)&#8208;ZNA, only the duplex form occurred at 5 &#176;C, while it was not possible to determine by NMR a single hairpin conformation at higher temperatures. In the case of the (S)&#8208;ZNA nucleoside modified oligomer, both hairpin and duplex forms were observable at 0 &#176;C, while a single hairpin conformation was detected at 37 &#176;C, suggesting a higher destabilizing effect on dsDNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Engineering in Bi&#8208;based Photo/electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main group Bi&#8208;based materials have gained popularity as N2 reduction reaction (NRR) photo/electrocatalysts due to their ability to inhibit competitive H2 evolution reactions (HER) and the unique N2 adsorption activities. The introduction of defects in Bi&#8208;based catalysts represents a highly effective strategy for enhancing light absorption, promoting efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, optimizing the activity of free radicals, regulating electronic structure, and improving catalytic performance. In this review, we outline the various applications of state of the defect engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts and elucidate the impact of vacancies on NRR performance. In particular, the types of defects, methods of defects tailoring, advanced characterization techniques, as well as the Bi&#8208;based catalysts with abundant defects and their corresponding catalytic behavior in NRR were elucidated in detail. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities for future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, which provides a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sites of the C&#8208;type Lectin&#8208;Like Fold</title>

C&#8208;type lectins, a large superfamily of proteins, are crucial in immunity and homeostasis. Their C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain enables them to bind a wide range of ligands, including those not dependent on Ca2+ interactions. This adaptability is further enhanced by their variable domain architecture and conformational plasticity. Secondary binding sites, often located away from the primary site, contribute to the C&#8208;type lectin functional diversity by accommodating different ligands, thus offering potential for drug discovery by fine&#8208;tuning biological responses and increasing selectivity.







Abstract
C&#8208;type lectins are a large superfamily of proteins involved in a multitude of biological processes. In particular, their involvement in immunity and homeostasis has rendered them attractive targets for diverse therapeutic interventions. They share a characteristic C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain whose adaptability enables them to bind a broad spectrum of ligands beyond the originally defined canonical Ca2+&#8208;dependent carbohydrate binding. Together with variable domain architecture and high&#8208;level conformational plasticity, this enables C&#8208;type lectins to meet diverse functional demands. Secondary sites provide another layer of regulation and are often intricately linked to functional diversity. Located remote from the canonical primary binding site, secondary sites can accommodate ligands with other physicochemical properties and alter protein dynamics, thus enhancing selectivity and enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the biological response. In this review, we outline the structural determinants allowing C&#8208;type lectins to perform a large variety of tasks and to accommodate the ligands associated with it. Using the six well&#8208;characterized Ca2+&#8208;dependent and Ca2+&#8208;independent C&#8208;type lectin receptors DC&#8208;SIGN, langerin, MGL, dectin&#8208;1, CLEC&#8208;2 and NKG2D as examples, we focus on the characteristics of non&#8208;canonical interactions and secondary sites and their potential use in drug discovery endeavors.

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bright chemogenetic reporters based on the HaloTag technology with green to red emission range were obtained by combining the molecular engineering of chemically&#8208;accessible fluorescent molecular rotors with mutations of the HaloTag protein. The reporters are suitable for wash&#8208;free live cell imaging with good contrast and the design strategy facilitates the future diversification and optimization of the properties.







Abstract
The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.

         <title>Metal Free Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles with Vinylarenes and Pyridine Enabled by Photocatalytic Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylarenes as synthetic linchpins towards the pyridine and 3D fragments conjugation enabled by metal free photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is described, which exhibit broad substrate scope, mild conditions, and excellent regioselectivity. This reaction tolerates late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules.







Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules. Initial mechanism studies and control experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions

         <title>Heptagonal Molecular Tiling via Self&#8208;Assembly of Heptagonal Phenylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling has been demonstrated at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface by the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring long alkoxy substituents. The heptagonal molecules align in an antiparallel pattern, which resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of the heptagonal cores.







Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level scrutinization of on&#8208;surface tiling garners considerable interest among scientists. Herein, we demonstrate molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling using the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring 14 long alkoxy substituents at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface using scanning tunneling microscopy. This heptagonal macrocycle produces an antiparallel pattern at the 1&#8208;phenyloctane&#8211;graphite interface through van der Waals interactions between the alkoxy chains. This pattern resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of heptagonal cores owing to intermolecular interactions between the alkoxy chains. Conversely, at the 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene&#8211;graphite interface, the heptagonal molecule forms an oblique pattern composed of four independent molecular orientations. This phenomenon arises from core distortion induced by the coadsorption of the solvent molecules within the intrinsic macrocyclic pores. This study elucidates the design strategy &#8211; specifically, the choice of heptagonal molecular building block &#8211; for heptagonal tiling and fills a crucial gap in the field of two&#8208;dimensional crystal engineering.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylation reactions of triarylamines with perfluoroalkyl iodides by visible&#8208;light irradiation of EDA complexes have been achieved. When these perfluoroalkylated triarylamines are subjected to acetone&#8208;sensitized irradiation, a highly stereospecific electrocyclization to endo perfluoroalkylated carbazoles is obtained. Mechanistic and photophysical insights are studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;M. Bonesi, A. Postigo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400905).

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To produce the key chiral intermediate of Rivastigmine, directed evolution was employed to enhance the specific activity of an alcohol dehydrogenase by over 100&#8208;fold under optimal conditions. Co&#8208;immobilization of this alcohol dehydrogenase with glucose dehydrogenase on magnetic nanoparticles yields easily recyclable biocatalysts. The biocatalytic reduction was combined with further chemical steps to achieve the chemoenzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%, demonstrating the synthesis of this important drug in an environmentally friendly and inexpensive manner.







Abstract
Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Amino Acid Derivative Coordination Compounds: Novel Contrast Agent and Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of multidimensional coordination compounds have been synthesized based on glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Magnetic resonance imaging studies and chiroptical properties have been explored.







Abstract
In this work a family of multidimensional (2&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethyl) amino acid coordination compounds have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized. For this purpose, glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine have been selected as starting amino acids and Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ as metallic nodes. From one side, for Mn2+ based dimer magnetic resonance imaging studies have been conducted, prompted by the number and disposition of the coordinated water molecules and taking into consideration the promising future of manganese&#8208;based coordination compounds as bio&#8208;compatible substitutes to conventional Gd based contrast agents. From another side, d10 block metal&#8208;based complexes allowed exploring photoluminescence properties derived by in&#8197;situ synthesized ligands. Finally, amino acid preserved structural chirality allowed us to examine chiroptical properties, particularly focusing on circularly polarized luminescence.

&lt;p&gt;A family of multidimensional coordination compounds have been synthesized based on glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Magnetic resonance imaging studies and chiroptical properties have been explored.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work a family of multidimensional (2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl) amino acid coordination compounds have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized. For this purpose, glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine have been selected as starting amino acids and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as metallic nodes. From one side, for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; based dimer magnetic resonance imaging studies have been conducted, prompted by the number and disposition of the coordinated water molecules and taking into consideration the promising future of manganese-based coordination compounds as bio-compatible substitutes to conventional Gd based contrast agents. From another side, d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; block metal-based complexes allowed exploring photoluminescence properties derived by &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; synthesized ligands. Finally, amino acid preserved structural chirality allowed us to examine chiroptical properties, particularly focusing on circularly polarized luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Spectroscopic Methods: Towards Chemical Sensor Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) have significant promise as chemical sensors for the differentiation of chiral analytes due to their highly tuneable nature. This review discusses the spectroscopic methods used for chiroptical sensing including photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance. Future directions are highlighted with a view towards the incorporation of CMOFs into chemical sensor devices.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.

         <title>Polymeric Nanozyme with SOD Activity Capable of Inhibiting Self&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite decades of research, Parkinson&#8217;s disease is still an idiopathic pathology for which no cure has yet been found. This is partly explained by the multifactorial character of most neurodegenerative syndromes, whose generation involves multiple pathogenic factors. Two of the most important ones are the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and oxidative stress. In this work, we address both issues by synthesizing a multifunctional nanozyme based on grafting a pyridinophane ligand that can strongly coordinate CuII, onto biodegradable PEGylated polyester nanoparticles. The resulting nanozyme exhibits remarkable superoxide dismutase activity together with the ability to inhibit the self&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into amyloid&#8208;type fibrils. Furthermore, the combination of the chelator and the polymer produces a cooperative effect whereby the resulting nanozyme can also halve CuII&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Methylglyoxal on the Conformation, Function, and Aggregation Propensity of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that people suffering from hyperglycemia have a higher propensity to develop Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). One of the most plausible mechanisms linking these two pathologies is the glycation of neuronal proteins and the pathological consequences of it. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, a key component in PD, can be glycated at its fifteen lysine. In fact, the end products of this process have been detected on aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein isolated from in vivo. However, the consequences of glycation are not entirely clear, which are of crucial importance to understand the mechanism underlying the connection between diabetes and PD. To better clarify this, we have here examined how methylglyoxal (the most important carbonyl compound found in the cytoplasm) affects the conformation and aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, as well as its ability to cluster and fuse synaptic&#8208;like vesicles. The obtained data prove that methylglyoxal induces the Lys&#8208;Lys crosslinking through the formation of MOLD. However, this does not have a remarkable effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, although it completely depletes its native propensity to form soluble oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils. Moreover, methylglyoxal has a disrupting effect on the ability of &#945;&#8208;synuclein to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Control over Anion Coordination on Pd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) with Regioisomeric Phosphine&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination of anionic donors is involved at various stages of catalytic cycles in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, but control over the spatial positioning of anions around a metal center is a challenge in coordination chemistry. Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;2, cis&#8208;&#954;1, or trans&#8208;&#954;1 coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal&#8208;alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation transition state for C&#8211;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and binuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable CAAC&#8208;triazenes: A New Nitrogen Ligand System with Donor and Conformational Flexibility, and with Application in Olefin Activation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic imines such as pyridylidene amines impart high catalytic activity when coordinated to a transition metal, largely imposed by their electronic flexibility. Here, this donor flexibility has been applied for the first time to CAAC&#8208;based systems through the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;triazenes. These new ligands offer a larger &#960;&#8208;conjugating that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene through three nitrogens rather than just one, as observed in N&#8208;heterocyclic imines. We demonstrate the straightforward synthesis of three new CAAC&#8208;triazenes containing different substituents on the terminal triazene nitrogen. These compounds are remarkably stable up to 120 &#176;C without loss of N2&#160;as typically observed with similar triazenes.&#160;E&#8208;to&#8208;Z&#160;isomerization within the triazene is instigated by UV light and is partially reversible dependent on the triazene substituent. The quinoline&#8208;substituted CAAC&#8208;triazene&#160;1&#8208;Q&#160;has been applied as an&#160;L,L&#8217;&#8208;type ligand in the synthesis of [PdCl2(1&#8208;Q)], [PdCl(Me)(1&#8208;Q)] and [Pd(Me)(H2O(1&#8208;Q)]+.&#160;E&#8208;to&#8208;Z&#160;ligand isomerization also occurs when coordinated to PdCl2, providing access to on&#8208;metal manipulation. The cationic complex [PdMe(H2O)(1&#8208;Q)]+&#160;is a precatalyst for oligomerization of ethylene to form initially 2&#8208;butene and subsequently linear and branched C8&#8211;C12products from butene activation. Moreover, isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene takes place efficiently with exceptionally low catalyst loading (10 ppm) and up to 74,000 turnover numbers.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis opens up for a novel cascade reaction concept where 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines first undergo an enantioselective [6+4] cycloaddition with trienamines, followed by a spontaneously series of reactions to provide chiral hexahydraoazulenes, of which some show bioactivity.







Abstract
A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8722;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), up to 96&#8201;% ee, and yields up to 52&#8201;%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer potential for photodegradation of organic dyes in new perfluorinated Ce&#8208;MOFs.







Abstract
Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure. We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8211;3.1&#8197;eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) Solid Solutions for Improving Solar Fuels Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by H2O Vapour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a molten&#8208;salt approach to synthesize Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions. Expand the light&#8208;harvesting wavelength range. Additionally, we found that with the introduction of ZnFe2O4, the photogenerated electrons transition from CoO4 tetrahedron to FeO6 octahedron, and the FeO6 octahedron becomes the photocatalytic reduction site. The introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenoannulated tridecacyclene, an unprecedented saddle&#8208;shaped non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon, has been synthesized. Under electrochemical conditions, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid subunits in the charged states. Chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the corresponding dication and dianion, which were comprehensively characterized both in experiment and theory.







Abstract
We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>

         <dc:description>
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes with thioether linkers exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The peculiar excitation dynamics responsible for the inversion was revealed; the pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures.







Abstract
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.

         <title>Control of Kinetic Pathways toward Supramolecular Chiral Polymorphs for Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The chiral and amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 exhibits kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways toward three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct nanomorphologies and chiroptical properties. Temporal control of the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C leads to aggregate mixtures consisting of different ratios of Agg. B and Agg. C that show wavelength&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788&#8211;805&#8197;nm and g&#8208;factors between &#8722;4.2&#215;10&#8722;2 and &#8722;5.1&#215;10&#8722;2.

         <title>Utility of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate enables efficient chloride removal during sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride synthesis allowing the controlled amine&#8208;initiated ring opening polymerization. This approach can avoid sublimation or other intensive purification of NCAs and NNCAs easing the synthesis of polypeptides, polypeptoids, and polypeptp(o)ides.







Abstract
The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein's Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#8197;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8211;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.

         <title>Replacement of Toxic Hydrazines in Satellite Propulsion with Greener Dinitramide&#8208;Based Energetic Ionic Liquid Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine&#8208;free liquid ionic candidate formulations for satellite propulsion have been identified and prepared. They are based on the dinitramide anion, which is environmentally more benign. An initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides was first weened to 3 candidates, from which only one was retained that has acceptable sensitivities and melting point.







Abstract
Satellite propulsion uses liquid mono or bi&#8208;propellants composed of a hydrazine in combination with a strong oxidant. However, hydrazines are highly toxic. As a result, many research efforts for more environmentally compatible propellants have been made over the past decade. In this study we evidence green formulations that retain high propulsive performances. They are based on the dinitramide anion. From an initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides 3 best candidates were selected after evaluation of their potential syntheses, calculated theoretical performances, experimental synthesis optimizations and decomposition temperatures. These three salts were then formulated to obtain acceptable sensitivities and melting points, which eventually led to only one formulation being retained: a 40&#8201;:&#8201;60 mixture of dimethylammonium dinitramide and ammonium dinitramide phlegmatized by 10&#8201;% of glycerol.

Synopsis: Mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated carbodiphosphoranes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond, have been synthesised. The bonding situation in these complexes was elucidated computationally, while their reactivity was investigated experimentally.







Abstract
The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules. Furthermore, the driving forces accountable for mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllation were elucidated along with the reactivity of the Be=C bond.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules. Furthermore, the driving forces accountable for mono-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-beryllation were elucidated along with the reactivity of the Be=C bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;Emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct visualization of the catalytic activity of electrode materials, represented by the labelled metal plates, via an array of light&#8208;emitting diodes, is symbolized by glowing eyes. Integrated into a bipolar electrochemical set&#8208;up, depicted by the &#948;&#8722; and &#948;+ polarization, such a system allows the efficiency of the anodic and cathodic catalysts for water splitting to be evaluated in a single image. The result is an instantaneous optical readout of catalytic information, complementary to classic electrochemical techniques. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kuhn, G. Salinas and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400078).

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot on the first azobenzene&#8208;based metallocycle that reversibly undergoes photoisomerization without disassembly! The cover feature illustrates the reversible switching between the (E,E) and (Z,Z) isomers of [Cu2(3,3&#8217;&#8208;azobenz(metPA)2](BF4)2. The electronic spectra reflect the unique combination of femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption in solution and femtosecond pump&#8211;probe photodissociation in the gas phase, which were used to characterize the primary switching dynamics. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Riehn, R. Diller, S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400205).

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8242;s nucleocapsid protein/RNA biocondensates with antimicrobial peptides is an effective strategy to block or slow down RNA transcription, thus preventing virions&#8217; assembly. Our biophysical results illustrate how peptides can modify the dynamics and morphology of such droplets. Depending on the peptides&#8217; characteristics, which regulate their partitioning into the droplets, various effects have been observed, including droplet clustering and the formation of fibrillar aggregates. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Oliva, R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400048).

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile in neutral buffer can be temperature controlled. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) is important, and the selective construction of perforated vesicles or nanofibers is achieved by heating the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile to 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt;LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt;LCST) and then cooling it to room temperature. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Hisamatsu, N. Umezawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400134).

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene as Precursor of 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;Substituted Long&#8208;Axially Symmetric Pyrene Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>Pyrene derivatives bearing substituents at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 find numerous applications, as exemplified by their use in lasers, sensors, and bioimaging probes. However, these derivatives typically have point&#8208;symmetric or short&#8208;axially symmetric structures, whereas long&#8208;axially symmetric derivatives remain underexplored because of the difficulty in obtaining their precursor, 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene. To address this problem, we herein synthesized 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene in an overall yield (71% over four steps) considerably exceeding those of existing methods. 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene was converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron&#8208;donor (alkoxy) groups at positions 1 and 3 and electron&#8208;acceptor (formyl) groups at positions 6 and 8. 13OPA exhibited photophysical properties distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers, featuring a broad and strongly redshifted absorption, strong fluorescence with reduced sensitivity to protic solvents, and small dipole moment change upon photoexcitation. The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8211;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene&#8208;based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced insulin synthesis is presented that utilizes one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide bond formation enabled by acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxides in the presence of chloride anion. S&#8208;chlorocysteine generated from cysteine sulfoxides reacts with an S&#8208;protected cysteine to afford S&#8208;sulfenylsulfonium cation, which then furnishes the disulfide or reversely returns to the starting materials depending on the S&#8208;protection employed and the reaction conditions. Use of S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) selectively give the disulfide under weak acid conditions in the presence of MgCl2 even if S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine (Cys(MBzl)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) are also present. In contrast, the S&#8208;MBzl pair yields the disulfide under more acidic conditions in the presence of a chloride anion source. These reaction conditions allowed a one&#8208;pot insulin synthesis. Additionally, lipidated insulin was prepared by a one&#8208;pot disulfide&#8208;bonding/lipidation sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>The Characterization of Multifaceted PREP1 Peptides Provides Insights into Correlations between Spectroscopic and Structural Properties of Amyloid&#8208;like Assemblies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread ability of proteins and peptides to self&#8208;assemble by forming cross&#8208;&#946; structure is one of the most significant discoveries in structural biology. Intriguingly, the cross&#8208;&#946; association of proteins/peptides may generate intricate supramolecular architectures with uncommon spectroscopic properties. We have recently characterized self&#8208;assembled peptides extracted from the PREP1 protein that are endowed with interesting structural/spectroscopic properties. We here demonstrate that the green fluorescence emission of the peptide PREP1[117&#8208;132] (&#955;em ~ 520 nm), can be induced by excitation with UV radiation. The associated unusually large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; ~ 150 nm) represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of an internal resonance energy transfer in amyloid&#8208;like structures, where the blue emission of some assemblies becomes the excitation radiation for others. Moreover, the characterization of PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants provides insights into the sequence/structure and structure/spectroscopic properties relationships. Our data suggests that the green fluorescence is plausibly associated with antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states of the peptide whereas parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are only endowed with blue fluorescence. Notably, the different PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants also form assemblies characterized by distinct morphologies. Indeed, the parent peptide and single mutants form compact but structured aggregates whereas most of the double mutants exhibit elongated and highly extended fibers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The protection of lead halide perovskite within a stable matrix normally leads to the loss of semiconducting properties. Here, we report the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass interpenetrating networks via a cold pressing method, which allows the advantages of bright photoluminescence, high photoconductivity and environmental stability. This hybrid architecture has provided a novel design strategy for the real&#8208;world application of perovskite&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <title>KpsS1 Mediates the Glycosylation of Pseudaminic Acid in Acinetobacter Baumannii</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram&#8208;negative pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in A. baumannii remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse&#8208;positive and negative A. baumannii clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse&#8208;positive A. baumannii strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;kpsS1, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of A. baumannii, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engraved Lattice&#8208;Matched NiO/NiFe2O4 Heterostructure with Ample Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8211;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4 mV dec&#8211;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two&#8208;electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery assembled by Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn&#8208;air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Central Metals in Bulky Phthalocyanines for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II), and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and well&#8208;established bulky peripheral substituents (either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy) were synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The trend of photovoltaic efficiencies (PCEs) for free&#8208;base and metallo Pcs followed the order Zn(II)Pc &gt; Mg(II)Pc &gt;&gt; H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc regardless of the peripheral substitution. Higher efficiencies (4.95 versus. 3.63 for the Zn(II) derivatives) were achieved with Pcs bearing the bulkier 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy group, indicating a lower aggregation and more suitable HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels. Furthermore, these derivatives showed a more relevant influence of the metal on the PCE (from the highest value of 4.95 for the Zn(II)Pc to the lowest value of 0.23 for the Ru(II)Pc. In both series, the best PCEs observed with the Zn(II) derivatives were mainly due to their highest Jsc values. The lowest efficiencies found for the free&#8208;bases and Ru(II) derivatives were attributed to a mismatch between their LUMO levels and the conduction band of the TiO2 and lower light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, respectively. In conclusion, Zn(II) derivatives are still the best Pc candidates to use as sensitizers in molecular photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Dependent Activation of Photoacids and Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids and bases allow remote control over pH in reaction solutions, which is of fundamental importance to an array of applications. Herein, we evaluate the wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength photoreactivity of triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts as a representative photoacid and p&#8208;(benzoyl)benzyl triethylammonium tetraphenylborate as a photobase, constructing a wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemical action plot for each of the compounds. We monitor the pH change of the solution on&#8208;line within the cavity of the laser vial and demonstrate a marked mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the photoacid and base with the photochemical action plot, unveiling reactivity at extremely low absorptivities. Our findings are of critical importance for the use of photoacids and bases, unambiguously demonstrating that absorption is no guide to chemical reactivity with critical consequences for the wavelength employed in applications of photoacids and bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8208;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (M,M,M)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed high emission quantum yield (&#934;f = 80%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp = &#8722;1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3). According to the the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT)&#160;calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of tf = 1.89 ns.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ&#8208;His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&#964; &lt; 50 ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5 &#8208; 9 &#181;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1&#8208;nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8722;H Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of several types of tertiary amines with alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium(III) alkyl complexes. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates enabled to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines.







Abstract
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions with para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) dramatically enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. We explore the possibilities of a ligand new to this field, pyridylpyrrolides. These complexes display highly reversible hydrogen activation and repeatable hyperpolarisation in a variety of solvents, without the reduction of alkene ligands. Ligand functional group modifications reveal an untapped potential chemical scope for the development of hyperpolarisation catalysts.







Abstract
Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation of Alkynes: Embracing Conventional and Electrochemical Routes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation can be efficiently achieved with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities through two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes a conventional method, involving the reduction of nickel salt (NiBr2&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) using manganese metal. The second method employs a one&#8208;step electrochemical reaction, utilizing the sacrificial anode process and NiBr2bipy catalysis. Both methods yield silylated heterocycles in good to high yields through a&#160;syn&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#160;cyclization process. Control experiments and molecular electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry) provided further insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Solution Behavior of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Complexes with Tripodal&#160;N&#8208;Donor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of multiple rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes (Ln = Y, La, Ce, Sm, Lu) using tripodal&#160;N&#8208;donor ligands, which offer the key advantage of featuring only C, H, O and N elements, facilitating incineration to recover the metal. The structural properties of the Ln3+&#160;complexes were investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing that the ligands form complexes with a 1:1 ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio, with two of the three triflate anions coordinated to the metal centers in all cases. The coordination of the third triflate anion was found to be variable, as supported by various NMR spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, transitioning from the previously reported tris(hydrazonyl)thiophosphanyl (SP)&#8208;based ligand system to the herein reported tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl) amine (tren)&#8208;anchored ligand system enhanced flexibility, resulting in improved encapsulation of the lanthanide ions. Competition studies between the two systems revealed selective coordination of the lutetium ion with the more flexible system. Thus, enhancing the flexibility of the ligand systems used for extraction has the potential to increase their efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Dyes for Photoacoustic Imaging and Their Use as Analyte&#8208;Responsive Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing imaging tools that can report on the presence of disease&#8208;relevant analytes in multicellular organisms can provide insight into fundamental disease mechanisms as well as provide diagnostic tools for the clinic. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a light&#8208;in, sound&#8208;out imaging technique that allows for high resolution, deep&#8208;tissue imaging with applications in pre&#8208;clinical and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. The continued development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing small&#8208;molecule dyes promises to improve the capabilities of this emerging imaging modality. For example, new dye scaffolds bearing chemoselective functionalities are enabling the detection and quantification of disease&#8208;relevant analytes through activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) approaches. Recently described strategies to engineer NIR absorbing xanthenes have enabled development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI probes using this classic dye scaffold. Herein, we present current strategies for red&#8208;shifting the spectral properties of xanthenes via bridging heteroatom or auxochrome modifications. Additionally, we explore how these strategies, coupled with chemoselective spiroring&#8208;opening approaches, have been employed to create ABS probes for in vivo detection of hypochlorous acid, nitric oxide, copper (II), human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1, and carbon monoxide. Given the versatility of the xanthene scaffold, we anticipate continued growth and development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI imaging probes based on this dye class.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated aza&#8208;BDP derivatives with various electron donors is designed, synthesized, and characterized. The impact of diverse electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties is examined through steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical analyses, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, and theoretical computations.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs=710&#8197;nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs=685&#8197;nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F=0.2&#8211;0.7&#8201;% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F=27&#8201;% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=0.3&#8211;1.5&#8201;%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T=53.2&#8197;&#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T=114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. These triplet state lifetimes are much longer than that obtained with diiodoAzaBDP (intramolecular heavy atom effect, &#964;T=1.5~7.2&#8197;&#956;s). These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers, for which longer triplet state lifetimes are usually desired. Theoretical computations displayed that the triplet state is mainly localized on the AzaBDP core, moreover, it was found that the HOMO/LUMO energy gap decreased after introducing donor moieties to the skeleton as compared with the reference.

         <title>CO2 Photoreduction Over Semiconducting 2D Materials with Supported Single Atoms: Recent Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting 2D materials with supported single atoms combine the advantages of 2D structures with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offering increased light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transfer, electron localization at active sites, improved reactant adsorption and activation, etc. This review highlights their significant potential and recent advancements in CO2 photoreduction, while also identifying key challenges and delineating future research directions.







Abstract
In the face of the growing energy crisis and environmental challenges, substantial efforts are now directed toward sustainable clean energy as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels. CO2 photoreduction into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is widely recognized as a promising approach to mitigate current energy and environmental concerns. Photocatalysts comprising single atoms (SAs) supported on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials (SAs&#8208;2DSemi) have emerged as a novel frontier due to the combined merits of SA catalysts and 2D materials. In this study, we review advancements in metal SAs confined on 2DSemi substrates, categorized into four groups: (1) metal oxide&#8208;based, (2) g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based, (3) emerging, and (4) hybridized 2DSemi, for photocatalytic CO2 conversion over the past few years. With a particular focus on highlighting the distinct advantages of SAs&#8208;2DSemi, we delve into the synthesis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, their catalytic performances, and mechanistic elucidation facilitated by experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Following this, we outline the challenges in this field and offer perspectives on harnessing the potential of SAs&#8208;2DSemi as promising photocatalysts. This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for the future development of 2D photocatalytic materials involving SAs for CO2 reduction.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced Generation of Aryl Radical and Applications: Generation of aryl radicals under photosensitized, photoinitiated, and direct or indirect photoredox&#8208;catalyzed conditions are reviewed. The utilization of aryl radicals in various reactions is demonstrated with examples.







Abstract
Photoinduced aryl radical generation is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis that facilitates the formation of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The synthetic applications of photoinduced aryl radical formation in the synthesis of complex organic compounds, including natural products, physiologically significant molecules, and functional materials, have received immense attention. An overview of current developments in photoinduced aryl radical production methods and their uses in organic synthesis is given in this article. A generalized idea of how to choose the reagents and approach for the generation of aryl radicals is described, along with photoinduced techniques and associated mechanistic insights. Overall, this article offers a critical assessment of the mechanistic results as well as the selection of reaction parameters for specific reagents in the context of radical cascades, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, aryl radical functionalization, and selective C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl substrates.

         <title>Identification of the Cirratiomycin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Cirratus: Elucidation of the Biosynthetic Pathways for 2,3&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces cirratus by genome sequencing and gene inactivation. The biosynthesis of two nonproteinogenic amino acids was elucidated: (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is synthesized from threonine by four enzymes, CirQ, CirR, CirS and CirB, and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine (HMSer) is synthesized from d&#8208;serine by CirH.







Abstract
Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in&#8197;vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.

         <title>A General Concept for the Electronic and Steric Modification of 1&#8208;Metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes: A Case Study of Group 4 Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes were prepared from suitable organolithium precursors. The effect of introduction of phenyl groups was studied using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. For the first time cyclic voltammetry, EPR, and solid state NMR spectroscopy were used to support structural and DFT data.







Abstract
The synthesis of group 4 metal 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes as organometallic analogues of elusive 1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene has so far been limited to SiMe3 substituted examples. We present the synthesis of two Ph substituted dilithiated ligand precursors for the preparation of four new 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M] (M=Ti, Zr; ebthi=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl)). The organolithium compounds [Li2(RC3Ph)] (1&#8201;b: R=Ph, 1&#8201;c: R=SiMe3) as well as the metallacycles of the general formula [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M(R1C3R2)] (2&#8201;b: M=Ti, R1=R2=Ph, 2&#8201;c: M=Ti, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3; 3&#8201;b: M=Zr, R1=R2=Ph; 3&#8201;c: M=Zr, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3) were fully characterised. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and quantum chemical bond analysis of the Ti and Zr complexes reveal ligand influence on the biradicaloid character of the titanocene complexes. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy of structurally similar Ti complexes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)Ti(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] (2&#8201;a), 2&#8201;b, and 2&#8201;c was carried out to evaluate the accessibility of an EPR active triplet state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that introduction of Ph groups renders the complexes easier to reduce. 13C CPMAS NMR analysis provides insights into the cause of the low field shift of the resonances of metal&#8208;bonded carbon atoms and provides evidence of the absence of the &#946;&#8722;C&#8722;Ti interaction.

         <title>64Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional chelators based on bispidine picolinates allow rapid and efficient labeling with the positron emitter Cu&#8208;64 under mild conditions. The resulting 64CuII&#8208;labeled bispidine complexes exhibit high in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo stability. Isothiocyanate functionalization of bispidine picolinates in C9 position enables efficient coupling to targeting vector molecules. After 64CuII&#8208;labeling of target modules, tumor visualization by PET with high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio is obtained.







Abstract
Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis&#8208;pyridine derivative, which are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities &gt;200&#8197;MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum and SOD demonstrate high stability and inertness of the 64Cu&#8208;bispidine complexes. Biodistribution studies performed in Wistar rats indicate a rapid renal elimination for both 64Cu&#8208;labeled chelates. The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl&#8208;NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS&#8208;functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor&#8208;bearing mice showed specific accumulation of the 64Cu&#8208;labeled TMs in PSCA&#8208; and FAP&#8208;overexpressing tumors (standardized uptake value (SUV) for PC3: 2.7&#177;0.6 and HT1080: 7.2&#177;1.25) with almost no uptake in wild type tumors.

         <title>Increasing Dimensionality in Self&#8208;Assembly: Toward Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to attain 2D supramolecular polymers, following both a thermodynamic or a kinetic regime, are reviewed. The examples of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies and showing elegant applications.







Abstract
Different approaches to achieve 2D supramolecular polymers, as an alternative to the covalent bottom&#8208;up approaches reported for the preparation of 2D materials, are reviewed. The significance of the operation of weak non&#8208;covalent forces to induce a lateral growth of a number of self&#8208;assembling units is collected. The examples of both thermodynamically and kinetically controlled formation of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies (nanosheets, scrolls, porous surfaces) and showing elegant applications like chiral recognition, enantioselective uptake or asymmetric organic transformations. Furthermore, elaborated techniques like seeded or living supramolecular polymerizations have been demonstrated to give rise to complex 2D nanostructures.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bis&#8208;Norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ray of sunlight absorbed by a solution will be stored and later released as heat energy. The norbornadiene derivatives designed and studied in this work swirl around the flask like autumn leaves symbolizing the cyclic nature of molecular solar thermal energy storage; and as leaves turn red in autumn, so the absorption of these molecular switches is redshifted. The natural setting reflects the ultimate goal of providing a new, renewable way of storing energy, thereby protecting the environment and the climate.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in Vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction between quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates, styryl dye libraries were successfully generated under mild conditions, and their optical properties information was simultaneously obtained. This powerful strategy, which is applicable both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells, enables the rapid discovery of styryl dyes with desirable characteristics that may find a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in&#8197;situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.

         <title>A Family of Hexacopper Phenylsilsesquioxane/Acetate Complexes: Synthesis, Solvent&#8208;Controlled Cage Structures, and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexacopper phenylsilsesquioxane/acetate complex exhibits high catalytic activity in (i) oxygenations of hydrocarbons, (ii) Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, and (iii) tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction, leading to lactone directly from cyclohexane







Abstract
Convenient self&#8208;assembly synthesis of copper(II) complexes via double (phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate) ligation allows to isolate a family of impressive sandwich&#8208;like cage compounds. An intriguing feature of these complexes is the difference in the structure of a pair of silsesquioxane ligands despite identical (Cu6) nuclearity and number (four) of acetate fragments. Formation of particular combination of silsesquioxane ligands (cyclic/cyclic vs condensed/condensed vs cyclic/condensed) was found to be dependent on the synthesis/crystallization media. A combination of Si4&#8208;cyclic and Si6&#8208;condensed silsesquioxane ligands is a brand new feature of cage metallasilsesquioxanes. A representative Cu6&#8208;complex (4) (with cyclic silsesquioxanes) exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. Maximum yield of the products of cyclohexane oxidation attained 30&#8201;%. The compound 4 was also tested as catalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone by m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid: maximum yields of 88&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% of &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone were achieved upon conventional heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h and MW irradiation at 70 or 80&#8201;&#176;C during 30&#8197;min, respectively. It was also possible to obtain the lactone (up to 16&#8201;% yield) directly from the cyclohexane via a tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction using the same oxidant.

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#174;p* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (p*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#174;p* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8211;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X = 10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8208;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8211;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of olefins activated on highly Lewis&#8208;acidic calcium cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF = C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying Cation Exchange in {Cr7Co} Pseudorotaxanes: Preparatory Studies for Hybrid Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the design of dynamic supramolecular systems used in molecular machines, it is important to understand the binding preferences between the macrocycle and stations along the thread. Here, we apply&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the relative stabilities of a series of linear alkylammonium templated pseudorotaxanes with the general formula [H2NRR&#8217;][Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16] by exchanging the cation in solution. Our results show that the pseudorotaxanes are able to exchange threads via a dissociative mechanism. The position of equilibrium is dependent upon the ammonium cation and solvent used. Short chain primary ammonium cations are shown to be far less favourable macrocycle stations than secondary ammonium cations. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) has been used to look at disassembly of the pseudorotaxanes in a solvent&#8208;free environment and stability trends compared to those in acetone&#8208;d6. The energy needed to induce 50% of the precursor ion loss (E50) is used shows a similar trend to the equilibria measured by NMR. The relative stabilities of these hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes are different to those of host&#8208;guest compounds involving crown ethers and this may be valuable for the design of molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate long&#8208;lived radical intermediates &#8208;&#8208; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8208;&#8208; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Peri&#8208;alkylated terrylenes and ternaphthalenes building&#8208;blocks towards multi&#8208;edge nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8208; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene&#8217;s peri&#8208;positions &#8208; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene&#8217;s chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization which include transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested which could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.</dc:description>

         <title>A Halogen Bonding [2]Rotaxane Shuttle for Chloride&#8208;Selective Optical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic halogen bonding multi&#8208;station [2]rotaxane displays a selective optical response to chloride over bromide and iodide anions. Chloride binding induces a translocation of the isophthalamide&#8208;functionalised macrocycle from the naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations to the halogen bonding station, leading to a reduction in the donor&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer absorption arising from macrocycle&#8208;NDI interactions, whereas the larger halides are excluded from the interlocked cavity.







Abstract
The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported.

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic halogen bonding multi-station [2]rotaxane displays a selective optical response to chloride over bromide and iodide anions. Chloride binding induces a translocation of the isophthalamide-functionalised macrocycle from the naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations to the halogen bonding station, leading to a reduction in the donor-acceptor charge-transfer absorption arising from macrocycle-NDI interactions, whereas the larger halides are excluded from the interlocked cavity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported. The rotaxane was synthesised via a chloride ion template-directed cyclisation of an isophthalamide macrocycle around a multi-station axle containing peripheral naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations and a halogen bonding (XB) bis(iodotriazole) based station. Proton NMR studies indicate the macrocycle resides preferentially at the NDI stations in the free rotaxane, where it is stabilised by aromatic donor-acceptor charge transfer interactions between the axle NDI and macrocycle hydroquinone moieties. Addition of chloride ions in an aqueous-acetone solvent mixture induces macrocycle translocation to the XB anion binding station to facilitate the formation of convergent XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrogen bonding HB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; interactions, which is accompanied by a reduction of the charge-transfer absorption band. Importantly, little to no optical response was induced by addition of bromide or iodide to the rotaxane, indicative of the size discriminative steric inaccessibility of the interlocked cavity to the larger halides, demonstrating the potential of using the mechanical bond effect as a potent strategy and tool in chloride-selective chemo-sensing applications in aqueous containing solvent environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review paper features the use of ionic liquids in tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. We aim to give the readers some general context of the structure and properties of ionic liquids because it is the ground for shaping the electrolyte. Furthermore, the characterization techniques and results are discussed.







Abstract
Ionic liquids are an extraordinary group of compounds, fully ionic in structure like inorganic salts but with low melting points, that resemble organic molecular solvents. Their chemical, electrochemical, and thermal stability is what draws the attention and enables their use in many applications, including electrochemical power sources. Even though they are no longer considered eco&#8208;friendly because of nonnegligible toxicity and long bioaccumulation, they can still be efficiently recovered, purified, and reused. These attributes can be harvested to enhance the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The variety of anions and cations for ILs and their influence on the final properties of the compound opens the road to tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes. Ionic liquids as plasticizers constitute a major part of gel polymer electrolytes (average of 70&#8197;wt%) and hence, they affect the fundamental properties of gel electrolytes like ionic conductivity and electrochemical window. They also improve the safety features of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thiolate&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid Catalysts for Reduction of CO2: Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Amines to Form N&#8208;Formamides and N&#8208;Methylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid is a novel type of catalyst that utilizes sulfur as the active center in an ionic liquid. It exhibits diverse functionalities in activating hydrogenated silane and amine, leading to ultra&#8208;high catalytic activity in the reductive functionalization of CO2 with amines and hydrosilane. By controlling the CO2 pressure, it enables selective synthesis of varied formamides and methylamines with high yields.







Abstract
Developing efficient catalysts to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is valuable for reducing carbon emissions. Herein, a kind of novel thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid with sulfur as the active site was designed and synthesized, which served as highly efficient catalyst for the reductive N&#8208;functionalization of CO2 by amines and hydrosilane. By adjusting the CO2 pressure, various N&#8208;formamides and N&#8208;methylamines were selectively obtained in high yields. Remarkably, at the catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol %, the N&#8208;formylation reaction of N&#8208;methylaniline exhibited an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) up to 600&#8197;h&#8722;1, which could be attributed to the roles of the ionic liquids in activating hydrosilane and amine. In addition, control experiments and NMR monitoring experiments provided evidence that the reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane yielded formoxysilane intermediates that subsequently reacted with amines to form N&#8208;formylated products. Alternatively, the formoxysilane intermediates could further react with hydrosilane and amine to produce 4&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced aminal products. These aminal products served as crucial intermediates in the N&#8208;methylation reactions.

         <title>Robust Red&#8208;Absorbing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;property guidelines are disclosed for creating robust donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) photochromes. A comprehensive investigation has revealed that a DASA photochrome with a low degree of charge separation is desired to achieve a robust, reversible photoswitching. Other indirect factors that could modulate the DASA photoswitching in polymer thin films are also discussed in detail.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adduct (DASA), a class of push&#8208;pull negative photochrome, has received large interest lately owing to its versatile synthesis, modularity and excellent photoswitching in solutions. From a technological perspective, it is imperative for this class of photoswitches to work robustly in solid state, e.&#8201;g. thin films. We feature a molecular framework for the optimized design of DASAs by introducing a new thioindoline donor (D3) and assessing its performance against known 2nd generation indoline&#8208;based donors. The systematic structure&#8208;function investigations suggest that to achieve robust reversible photoswitching, a ground state with low charge separation is desired. DASAs with stronger electron donors and a larger charge separation in the ground state result in a low population of the photothermalstationary state (PTSS) and reduced photostability. The DASA with thioindoline donor (D3A3) seems to be a special case among the donor series as it causes a red shift (ca. 15&#8197;nm), however with less polarization of the ground state and marginally better photostability as compared to the unsubstituted 2&#8208;methyl indoline (D1A3). We also emphasize the consideration of the key additional factors that can modulate the red&#8208;light photoswitching properties of DASA chromophores in polymer thin films, which might not be dominant in homogenous solution state.

         <title>Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by Using the Combination of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) Levers and Achiral N&#8208;Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two hands holding a molecule hint at chirality, which exists in three dimensions from the macro&#8208; to the micro&#8208;world. A new type of chirality is generated by rotating three functional groups to different orientations along an axis. An energy curve shows that there are three relatively stable conformations. Beams of light show the molecules can provide polarized light for future research and applications in materials science. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Jiao, G. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400005).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (glycosidases) take part in myriad biological processes and are important therapeutic targets. Competitive and mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors are useful tools to dissect their biological role and comprise a good starting point for drug discovery. The natural product, cyclophellitol, a mechanism&#8208;based, covalent and irreversible retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor has inspired the design of diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosidase inhibitor and activity&#8208;based probe scaffolds. Here, we sought to deepen our understanding of the structural and functional requirements of cyclophellitol&#8208;type compounds for effective human &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition. We synthesized a comprehensive set of &#945;&#8208;configured 1,2&#8208; and 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitol analogues bearing a variety of electrophilic traps. The inhibitory potency of these compounds was assessed towards both lysosomal and ER retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidases. These studies revealed the 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitols to be the most potent retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors, with the nature of the electrophile determining inhibitory mode of action (covalent or non&#8208;covalent). DFT calculations support the ability of the 1,5a&#8208;cyclophellitols, but not the 1,2&#8208;congeners, to adopt conformations that mimic either the Michaelis complex or transition state of &#945;&#8208;glucosidases.

&lt;p&gt;Glycoside hydrolases (glycosidases) take part in myriad biological processes and are important therapeutic targets. Competitive and mechanism-based inhibitors are useful tools to dissect their biological role and comprise a good starting point for drug discovery. The natural product, cyclophellitol, a mechanism-based, covalent and irreversible retaining &#946;-glucosidase inhibitor has inspired the design of diverse &#945;- and &#946;-glycosidase inhibitor and activity-based probe scaffolds. Here, we sought to deepen our understanding of the structural and functional requirements of cyclophellitol-type compounds for effective human &#945;-glucosidase inhibition. We synthesized a comprehensive set of &#945;-configured 1,2- and 1,5a-cyclophellitol analogues bearing a variety of electrophilic traps. The inhibitory potency of these compounds was assessed towards both lysosomal and ER retaining &#945;-glucosidases. These studies revealed the 1,5a-cyclophellitols to be the most potent retaining &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors, with the nature of the electrophile determining inhibitory mode of action (covalent or non-covalent).

         <title>Driving Triplet State Population in Benzothioxanthene Imide Dyes: Let's Twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an accessible chemical modification, a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion was induced in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone of a benzothioxanthene imide (BTI). This simple yet effective strategy was used to manipulate triplet formation with ease and to rationalize the closely intertwined connection between spin&#8211;orbit coupling, twisting of the &#960;&#8208;system and intersystem crossing. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Monnereau, C. Cabanetos, T. Le&#8197;Bahers and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400191).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient structured film has been fabricated through photopolymerization&#8208;induced diffusion. First, illumination with low&#8208;intensity UV light initiates the thiol&#8208;ene reaction only at the surface, and this triggers the diffusion of thiol molecules to the surface. Then, illumination with blue light initiates chain&#8208;growth acrylate homopolymerization, which arrests the spatial gradient of crosslink density. Due to its gradient structure, the film exhibits bending actuation both in air and solvent. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400515).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report detailed the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction catalyzed by a well&#8208;defined manganese(I)&#8208;pincer complex. Symmetrically substituted pyrazoles were synthesized by reacting 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. Unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were selectively made via the ADC of primary alcohols with methyl hydrazones. Water and hydrogen are liberated as the green byproducts. The endurance of these methodologies has been presented by producing 30 substrates with varied functionalities. Model reactions were scaled up to demonstrate practicability. The reaction rate and order were measured to transparent the involvement of the reagents during catalysis. Control experiments elucidated the plausible reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups&#160;has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2&#160;generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since inorganic nanoparticles have unique properties that differ from bulk materials, their material applications have attracted attention in various fields. In order to utilize inorganic nanoparticles for functional materials, they must be dispersed without agglomeration. Therefore, the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles are typically modified with organic ligands to improve their dispersibility. Nevertheless, the relationship between the tail group structure in organic ligands and the dispersibility of inorganic nanoparticles in organic solvents remains poorly understood. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. However, the structural requirements for amphiphilic ligands to &#8220;flexibly&#8221; disperse nanoparticles in less polar to polar solvents are still unclear. Here, we designed and synthesized several phosphonic acid ligands for structure&#8210;function relationship studies of flexdispersion. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements revealed that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains in organic ligands alone does not determine the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in organic solvents, but the arrangement of the individual chains also has an effect. From a practical application standpoint, it is preferable to design ligands with ethylene glycol chains on the outside relative to the particle surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870 K and 230 MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a = 10.9422(4) &#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of these intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pronounced Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Anisidine Amino Acid Diamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergent properties resulting from selective supramolecular interactions are of significant importance for materials and chemical systems. For the directed use of such properties, a fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism and the resulting mode of function is necessary for a tailored design. The self&#8208;induced diastereomeric anisochronism effect (SIDA), which occurs in the intermolecular interaction of chiral molecules, generates unique properties such as chiral self&#8208;recognition and nonlinear effects. Here we show that anisidine amino acid diamides lead to extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition. By systematic experiments we have investigated the underlying SIDA effect, explored its limits and finally successfully utilized it in the determination of enantiomeric ratios by NMR spectroscopy of chiral &#8216;SIDA&#8208;inactive&#8217; compounds such as thalidomide.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylenes: Monomeric Silanechalcogenones, Silanimines, Silirenes, and Insertion Products with P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stable ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes fc[(N{B})2Si] (A; fc = 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene, {B} = (HCNDipp)2B, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and fc[(NDipp)2Si] (B) are compared in a study focussing on their reactivity towards a range of small to moderately sized molecular substrates, viz. P4, S8, Se8, MesN3 (Mes = mesityl), RC&#8801;CH, and RC&#8801;CR (R = Ph, SiMe3). The Dipp&#8208;substituted congener B exhibits a more pronounced ambiphilicity and is sterically less congested than its 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl&#8208;substituted relative A, in line with the higher reactivity of the former. The difference in reactivity is obviously due more to electronic than to steric reasons, as is illustrated by the fact that both A and B react with the comparatively bulky substrate MesN3 under mild conditions to afford the corresponding silanimine fc[(N{B})2Si=NMes] and fc[(NDipp)2Si=NMes], respectively. The heavier ketone analogues fc[(N{B})2Si=E] (E = S, Se, Te) are readily available from A and the corresponding chalcogen. In contrast, the reaction of the more reactive silylene B with elemental sulfur or selenium is unspecific, affording product mixtures. However, fc[(NDipp)2Si=Se] is selectively prepared from B and (Et2N)3PSe; the Te analogue is also accessible, but crystallises as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With a focus on Mn based organometallic compounds with suitable physico&#8208;chemical properties to serve as precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Mn&#8208;containing materials, systematic synthetic approaches with ligand variation, detailed characterization, and theoretical input from density functional theory (DFT) studies are presented. A series of new homoleptic all&#8208;nitrogen and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn(II) complexes bearing the acetamidinate, formamidinate, guanidinate and &#223;&#8208;ketoiminate ligands have been successfully synthesized for the first time. The specific choice of these ligand classes with changes in structure and coordination sphere and side chain variations result in significant structural differences whereby mononuclear and dinuclear complexes are formed. This was supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. To evaluate their suitability as precursors for deposition of Mn&#8208;based materials, the thermal properties were investigated in detail. Mn(II) complexes possessing the most promising thermal properties, namely Bis(N,N&#180;&#8208;ditertbutylformamidinato)manganese(II) (IV) and Bis(4&#8208;(isopropylamino)pent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;onato)manganese(II) (&#223;III) were used in reactivity studies with DFT to explore their interaction with oxidizing co&#8208;reactants such as oxygen and water which will guide future CVD and ALD process development.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl Conversion: From Closed&#8208;Cubane Photosystem II to Mn(V) Catalysts and the Role of the Entering Ligands.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low activation barrier for O&#8208;O coupling in the closed&#8208;cubane Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 'dangler' ion in the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo into a more reactive Mn4(IV)&#8208;oxyl species, enhancing O&#8208;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind this and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8208;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 dxy orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the dxy orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8208;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)&#8208;based catalysts. For other catalysts, ligands like OH&#8208; stabilize the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl species better than water, improving catalyst activation for reactions like C&#8208;H bond activation. This study is the first to explain the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl conversion, providing new foundation for Mn&#8208;based catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclopropanation of Active Methylene Derivatives Based on FeCl2 or FeCl3&#8208;Promoted Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were studied for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of active methylene derivatives. In the presence of FeCl3 as a stoichiometric oxidant and K2HPO4 as a base, the dehydrogenative cyclopropanation of active methylenes proceeded through the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization followed by the ionic cyclization to give the bicyclic cyclopropanes. The use of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes leads the subcatalytic cyclopropanation involving two redox pathways. In the presence of K2HPO4, the redox cyclopropanation proceeded by using FeCl2 (20 mol%) in combination with ligand (20 mol%).</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Electrolytes: Design Principles and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, rechargeable batteries are omnipresent and essential for our existence. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of electric fields, the introduction of electrolytes with fluorine (F)&#8208;based inorganic elemental compositions is a direction of exploration. However, most fluorocarbons have a high global warming potential and ozone depletion potential, which do not meet the sustainability requirements of the battery industry. Therefore, developing sustainable electrolytes is a viable option for future battery development. Although researchers have made much progress in electrolyte optimization, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. This review aims to elucidate the design principles and recent advances in this direction for solvents and salts. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of green electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Blue Photo&#8208; and Electroluminescence from CF3&#8208;Decorated Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organometallic complexes of earth&#8208;abundant copper(I) have long been studied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). Particularly, Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have recently emerged as promising organometallic emitters. However, blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA complexes have been rarely reported. Here we constructed two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA emitters, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz and MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz, by introducing one or two CF3&#8208; substitutes into carbazole ligands. Both complexes exhibited high thermal stability and blue emission colors. Moreover, two complexes exhibited different emission origins rooting from different donor ligands: a distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz or a dominant phosphorescence nature from local triplet excited state of the carbazole ligand for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz. Inspiringly, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz had high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 94% and short emission lifetimes of down to 1.2 &#956;s in doped films, accompanied by relatively high radiative rates in the 105 s&#8722;1 order. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz delivered pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 462 nm together with a high external quantum efficiency of 13.0%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocontrolled Binding of Styrylnaphthyridine Ligands to Abasic Site&#8208;Containing DNA by Reversible [2+2] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrylnaphthyridine derivatives are shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA). The ligand can be formed from its photodimer in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a promising tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder.







Abstract
Five novel styrylnaphthyridine derivatives were synthesized and shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA), which is an important therapeutic and diagnostic target. These compounds associate with AP&#8208;DNA with binding constants of 0.5&#8211;8.4&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 as shown by photometric and fluorimetric titrations. Specifically, these ligands bind preferentially to AP&#8208;DNA relative to regularly paired duplex DNA. As a special feature, the association of these ligands with DNA can be controlled by means of a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition. Upon irradiation at 420&#8197;nm the photodimer is formed, which does not bind to AP&#8208;DNA. In turn, the naphthyridine is regained with excitation at 315&#8197;nm. Most notably, this photoinduced deactivation and release of the DNA ligand can be performed in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder. Overall, these results provide a promising starting point for the development of functional AP&#8208;DNA ligands whose bioactivity can be modulated by light with local and temporal control.

         <dc:description>
The first example of phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;cored blue fluorophore with HLCT feature was reported. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped pure blue OLEDs demonstrated the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with the maximum EQE of 7.99&#8201;% accompanied with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, even maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
It is vital to develop highly efficient non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D&#8208;A fluorophores TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO possess the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non&#8208;doped OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PO/TPA&#8208;DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468&#8197;nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99&#8201;% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4&#8201;%~72.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based device exhibits low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non&#8208;doped OLEDs.

The TPA-DPO-based non-doped pure blue OLEDs demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance with the maximum EQE of 7.99&#8201;% accompanied with negligible efficiency roll-off, even maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital to develop highly efficient non-doped blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low-efficiency roll-off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D-A fluorophores TPA-PO and TPA-DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA-PO and TPA-DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA-PO and TPA-DPO possess the hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non-doped OLEDs with TPA-PO/TPA-DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468&#8197;nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA-DPO-based non-doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99&#8201;% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4&#8201;%~72.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the TPA-DPO-based device exhibits low-efficiency roll-off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non-doped OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Driven Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex (EDA) complex&#8208;based method for trifluoromethylating heterocycles, bypassing traditional photocatalysts and oxidants. Utilizing 395&#8197;nm light, it efficiently produces trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. The research emphasizes EDA photoactivation&#8216;s crucial role, thoroughly documented through experimental, mechanistic, and spectroscopic analyses, thereby expanding EDA complexes&#8242; utility in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Heterocyclic trifluoromethylation is efficiently initiated through a photochemical reaction utilizing an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, proceeding smoothly without the use of photocatalysts, transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or additional oxidants. This method has been optimized through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its versatility and efficacy across various substrates, including quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. Notably, this approach enables the practical synthesis of trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations that incorporate radical trapping and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of the an EDA complex and elucidated the reaction pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of EDA photoactivation in trifluoromethylation, significantly expanding the application scope of EDA complexes in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl Dimers as New Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomers of the title biaryl with one chiral axis and two helical moieties were resolved by chiral HPLC. Their chiroptical activities were evaluated by dissymmetry factors of the CD and CPL spectra. A stepwise mechanism of enantiomerization via rotation about the chiral axis was proposed by the DFT calculations.







Abstract
Dimers of anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl units and its mesityl derivative were synthesized by Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the corresponding chloro derivatives as new biaryls. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed that two polycyclic aromatic units with nonplanar deformations took a twisted conformation about the single bond as a chiral axis. Enantiomers of the nonsubstituted compound were resolved by chiral HPLC, and the enantiopure samples showed intense Cotton effects at 321&#8197;nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and emission bands at 449&#8197;nm in the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra with dissymmetry factor of |glum| 3.6&#215;10&#8722;3. The absolute stereochemistry of this biaryl was determined by the theoretical calculation of CD spectrum by the time&#8208;dependent DFT method. The barrier to enantiomerization was determined to be 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K. The dynamic process proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving the helical inversion of each aromatic unit and the rotation about the biaryl axis as analyzed by the DFT calculations.

         <title>Application of Mono and Trinuclear Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complexes in Differential Bacterial Imaging and Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of transition metal complexes for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an attractive alternative in mitigating a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In view of their photostability, long excited&#8208;state lifetimes, and tunable emission properties, transition metal complexes also contribute as bioimaging agents. In the present work, we designed mono and trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes to explore their imaging application and antibacterial potential.&#160; For this, we used Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the most prevalent of community&#8208;associated (CA) multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria (CA MDR) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as Gram&#8208;positive while Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and E. coli as Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In addition to differential bioimaging of these bacteria, we assessed the antibacterial effects of both mono and trinuclear Ir(III) complexes under exposure to 427 nm LED light. The data presented herein strongly suggest better efficacy of trinuclear Ir(III) complex over mononuclear complex in imparting photoinduced cell death of MRSA. Based on the safety profile of these complexes, we propose that trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complex hold great promise for selective recognition and targeting MDR bacteria with minimal off&#8208;target effect.</dc:description>

Interestingly, this methodology was catalyzed by the classical and commercial oxazaborolidine under mild conditions.

         <dc:description>Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <title>Optical Upconversion in Mononuclear Lanthanide Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed two kinds of co&#8208;crystal assemblies systems, consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb3+ and Er3+ and mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+, which can achieve Er3+ and Pr3+ upconversion luminescence, respectively, by Yb3+ sensitization under 980 nm excitation. The structure and composition of two co&#8208;crystal assemblies were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By investigation of the series of two assemblies, respectively, it is found that the strongest upconversion luminescence is both obtained when the molar ratio of Yb3+ and Ln3+ (Ln = Er or Pr) is 1 : 1. The energy transfer mechanism of Er3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion, while that of Pr3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion and cooperative sensitization upconversion. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension at room temperature, which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;transfer complexes: halogen&#8208;doped anthracene as a case of study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) crystals exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties with interesting applications. We present a rational and easy guide which allows to foresee the effective charge transfer co&#8208;crystal production and that is based on the comparison of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies of a donor and acceptor couple. For the sake of comparison, theoretical calculations have been carried out by using the cheap and fast PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian and pure HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ level of the theory. The results are then compared with experimental results obtained both by chemical (bromine and iodine were used as the acceptor) and electrochemical doping (exploiting an original experimental set&#8208;up by this laboratory: the electrochemical transistor). Infra&#8208;red vibrational experimental results and theoretically calculated spectra are compared to assess both the effective donor&#8208;acceptor (D/A) charge&#8208;transfer and transport mechanism (giant IRAV polaron signature). XPS spectra have been collected (carbon (1s) and iodine (3d5/2)) signals, yielding further evidence of the effective formation of the CT anthracene:iodine complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites for Glioma Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanocomposites, camouflaged by cell membranes, exosomes or other bio&#8208;membranes, exhibit exceptional characteristics that facilitate efficient and precise delivery of contrast agents or drugs to glioma sites. These biomimetic nanocomposites are promising in glioma imaging and therapy, including fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multimodal imaging, as well as chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy.







Abstract
Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor, is highly invasive and grows rapidly. As such, the survival of glioma patients is relatively short, highlighting the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of glioma. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the non&#8208;targeting delivery systems of contrast agents and drugs greatly hinder the effective glioma imaging and therapy. Fortunately, in recent years, investigators have constructed various biomimetic delivery platforms utilizing the exceptional advantages of biomimetic nanocomposites, such as immune evasion, homologous targeting ability, and BBB penetrating ability, to achieve efficient and precise delivery of substances to glioma sites for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this concept, we present the application of these biomimetic nanocomposites in fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi&#8208;modal imaging, as well as in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy for glioma. Lastly, we provide our perspective on this research field.

         <title>Detection and Characterization of Hydride Ligands in Copper Complexes by Hard X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound (Cu&#8208;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975 eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75 nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate pseudouridine (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63 nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75 nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Basicity and Nucleophilicity of Organosodium Reagents in Benzylic C&#8208;H Additions of Toluenes to Diarylethenes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Profiting from the dual&#160;high basicity and nucleophilicity of organosodium complexes, here we report the stepwise lateral metalation of a wide range of alkyl arenes (MeAr), mediated by hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble&#160;NaCH2SiMe3.PMDETA (PMDETA =&#160;N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine),&#160;followed by nucleophilic addition to olenfins of the newly generated&#160;NaCH2Ar.PMDETA complexes. This method grants access to a range of&#160;functionalised&#160;hydrocarbons in excellent yields and can be upgraded to catalytic regimes when using&#160;trans&#8208;stilbene, a 10 mol% of the alkyl sodium base and toluene as a solvent. Extending this approach to aromatic ketones leads to the formation of stilbenes under mild reaction conditions, resulting from the deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones. Combining spectroscopic studies with the trapping and&#160;characterisation&#160;of key reaction intermediates, mechanistic insights have been gained, advancing the understanding of coordination effects in organosodium chemistry, and shedding light on their special reactivity profiles.</dc:description>

A simple, effective, direct, and environmentally benign but unprecedented high mutual separation efficiency for Nd and Pr from their oxide mixture with &#946;Nd/Pr&gt;500 by selective dissolution in water equilibrated C4mim.NTf2 ionic liquid containing TTA.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, direct and economical method for the mutual separation of Nd and Pr was developed by the selective dissolution of Nd2O3 from their oxide mixtures in an ionic liquid containing 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) resulting in an unprecedented separation factor (&#946;Nd/Pr)&gt;500, which is 277&#8197;times more than the thus far reported &#946;Nd/Pr values. The proposed mechanism was supported by DFT computations.

         <title>A Case&#8208;Study on the Photophysics of Chalcogen&#8208;Substituted Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully systematic analysis of the effect of chalcogen atoms on the photophysical properties (absorption and fluorescence spectra, excited state lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration) of 30 custom&#8208;made chalcogen&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described. Intersystem crossing rate constants were estimated by several independent methods and showed a dependency scaling as Z0.4 and &#950;0.2.







Abstract
Singlet dioxygen has been widely applied in different disciplines such as medicine (photodynamic therapy or blood sterilization), remediation (wastewater treatment) or industrial processes (fine chemicals synthesis). Particularly, it can be conveniently generated by energy transfer between a photosensitizer's triplet state and triplet dioxygen upon irradiation with visible light. Among the best photosensitizers, substituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines are prominent due to their excellent photophysical properties, which can be tuned by structural modifications, such as halogen&#8208; and chalcogen&#8208;atom substitution. These patterns allow for the enhancement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, commonly attributed to the heavy atom effect, which correlates with the atomic number (
) and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (
) of the introduced heteroatom. Herein, a fully systematic analysis of the effect exerted by chalcogen atoms on the photophysical characteristics (absorption and fluorescence properties, lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration), involving 30 custom&#8208;made &#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted chalcogen&#8208;bearing zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described and evaluated regarding the heavy atom effect. Besides, the intersystem crossing rate constants are estimated by several independent methods and a quantitative profile of the heavy atom is provided by using linear correlations between relative intersystem crossing rates and relative atomic numbers. Good linear trends for both intersystem crossing rates (S1&#8208;T1 and T1&#8208;S0) were obtained, with a dependency on the atomic number and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant scaling as 
 and 
, respectively The trend shows to be independent of the solvent and temperature.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships for Potential Inversion From Electron Acceptors Based on Thiophene&#8208;Fused Triptycene Quinones, 1,4&#8208;Diketones and Their Malononitrile Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The products of two isomeric thiophene/triptycene para&#8208;quinones with malononitrile provide insights into modulating potential inversion in 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane type electron&#8208;acceptors. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding influences both the product distribution of the reaction to make the quinones, and the NMR chemical shift of the bridgehead hydrogens involved.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of a series of 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane (TCAQ) inspired electron acceptors based on thiophene&#8208;fused quinone and triptycene motifs is presented. This has yielded insights into structure&#8208;property relationships for establishing and modulating simultaneous two&#8208;electron reduction processes in TCAQ analogues. These new compounds were synthesised using a Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation between triptycene and thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarbonyl chloride. Isomeric para&#8208;quinones featuring a [c]&#8208;fused thiophene on one side and a &#946;,&#946;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;fused triptycene on the other were isolated alongside a thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;diketone which bears two triptycene fragments. Knoevenagel condensation of these products with malononitrile produced a quinoidal bis(dicyanomethylene), an oxo&#8208;dicyanomethylene and an acyclic bis(dicyanomethylene). This series of new electron accepting molecules has been studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography and the implications of their 3D structures on NMR and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results have been ascertained with conclusions underpinned by computational methods.

         <title>Phosphoramide&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Effective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphoramide&#8208;based tri&#8208; and hexacarboxylic acids L1 and L2 have been used as ligands for metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Whereas Zn&#8722;L1 and Cu&#8722;L1, with pseudo&#8208;3D network structures with strong hydrogen bonds between 2D layers, show high thermal stability and porosity, Zn&#8722;L2, with a typical 3D network structure, exhibits high stability and excellent gas&#8208;adsorption properties for H2, CO2, and CH4 without open metal sites.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective and facile synthetic routes to organic ligands, along with porous materials that exhibit exceptional gas&#8208;storage properties, promise significant industrial applications. Here, a two&#8208;step synthesis of novel organophosphorus ligands without metal catalysts is reported. These ligands serve as versatile linkers for the construction of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating various metal ions, including zinc and copper. One of the zinc&#8208;based MOFs demonstrates remarkable gas&#8208;storage properties, with a hydrogen (H2) capacity exceeding 2.5&#8197;wt% at 77&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa as well as a carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity exceeding 20&#8197;wt% at 298&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa. Furthermore, this zinc&#8208;based MOF can be synthesized through a solvothermal process on the gram scale that yields high&#8208;quality single crystals.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy and 2D materials: a perfect combination. Since graphene's SERS effect observation, 2D layered materials have been developed as active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This perspective highlights the key concepts behind SERS spectroscopy and provides new insights into a new research field that combines the design of SERS 2D substrates using Raman spectroscopy and imaging.







Abstract
The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.&#8201;g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.
