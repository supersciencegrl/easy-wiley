         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110 nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.</dc:description>

         <title>Free Aluminylenes: An Emerging Class of Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene analogues: Free aluminylenes and mono&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized aluminylenes are extremely reactive species. The ambiphilicity of these species allows facile activation of inert chemical bonds as well as coordination to transition metals in diverse modes. Free aluminylenes are potent synthons for unusual aluminium species.







Abstract
Aluminylenes (R&#8722;Al) are aluminium analogs of carbenes. In contrast to isolable carbenes, aluminylenes are extremely rare species. In the past years, pioneered by Schn&#246;ckel, Roesky and Power, a few free aluminylenes and their complexes have been reported. Such compounds have the aluminium atom in the oxidation state +I, which contrasts with classical organoaluminium derivatives that contain the element in the +III oxidation state. Aluminylenes, either in their free state or in the coordination sphere of a Lewis base, are capable of coordinating to transition metals and activating inert chemical bonds. Free aluminylenes are emerging as potent synthetic platforms for unusual aluminium species.

A transition metal&#8208;free method for the trans&#8208;hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes to afford (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is reported. Boron adds to the external carbon of the diyne framework. Experimental and DFT studies suggest that phosphine attack on the diyne is a key step in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We report a transition metal&#8208;free, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed method for the trans hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes with pinacolborane that affords (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes. The reaction proceeds with excellent selectivity for boron addition to the external carbon of the 1,3&#8208;diyne framework as unambiguously established by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The reaction displays a broad substrate scope including unsymmetrical diynes to generate products in high yield (up to 95&#8201;%). Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that phosphine attack on the alkyne is a key process in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds by DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>

A Pentacyclic fragment inspired from Perophoramidine. Natural product inspired PARP inhibitor.







Abstract
Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells that is, MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9&#8197;&#956;M IC50s by few of the compounds. &#947;H2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;&#947;&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC50s of 1.3&#8594;1.5&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Electro&#8208;assisted Molecular Assembly Giving Atomic&#8208;Scale Catalytic Active&#8208;Site Detection</title>

Pinpoint: This work proposes a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a carbon defect with a target structure. More specifically, it identified that the topmost carbon atom on a pentagon carbon defect is the active site for the oxygen reduction reaction from the experimental perspective.







Abstract
The artificially accurate design of nonmetal electrocatalysts&#8217; active site has been a huge challenge because no pure active species with the specific structure could be strictly controlled by traditional synthetic methods. Species with a multiconfiguration in the catalyst hinder identification of the active site and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have developed a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a pure pentagon ring on perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed by the subtle passivation process as the topmost carbon atom. Recognition of the carbon&#8208;defect electrocatalysis reaction mechanism was first downsized to the single&#8208;atom scale from the experimental perspective. It is expected that this innovative electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy could be extensively applied in the active structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of nonmetal electrocatalysts and verification of the exact active atom.

More importantly, the active atom was confirmed by the subtle passivation process as the topmost carbon atom. Recognition of the carbon-defect electrocatalysis reaction mechanism was first downsized to the single-atom scale from the experimental perspective. It is expected that this innovative electro-assisted molecular assembly strategy could be extensively applied in the active structure-controlled synthesis of nonmetal electrocatalysts and verification of the exact active atom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Vicinal Diol Approach for the Total Synthesis of Molestin E, ent&#8208;Sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;Sinumaximol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent total synthesis of furanocembranoids (FC) molestin E, ent&#8208;sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;sinumaximol A was achieved in 20&#8211;21 steps in the longest linear sequence (LLS). Building blocks were coupled through a furan metalation sequence and macrocycle formation was effected by Shiina lactonisation. The primary target molestin E was elaborated late&#8208;stage to 12 novel FC compounds.







Abstract
In this work an approach for the synthesis of furanocembranoid natural products containing the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diol moiety is disclosed. This culminated in the first total synthesis of the natural product molestin E, together with ent&#8208;sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;sinumaximol A as well as a thorough exploration of their chemistry. Late&#8208;stage ring&#8208;closure of the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diols to the corresponding epoxides was also demonstrated. Key features of this synthetic strategy include a stereoselective Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction, ring&#8208;closing metathesis and Shiina macrolactonisation. Chiral&#8208;pool materials were deployed to ensure the desired absolute stereochemistry which was confirmed by late&#8208;stage single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Performance through the Construction of a Supramolecular Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst is constructed by host&#8208;guest complexation. Benefiting from the multivalent supramolecular assembly, it exhibits a higher effective concentration of catalytic sites and better stability to temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, the supramolecular organic framework shows improved catalytic performance in the photocatalytic oxidation of aryl boronic acids and thioethers.







Abstract
A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst, named TM&#8208;SOF, is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[8]uril and a tetra&#8208;arm monomer containing four N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridinium)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (MPT) moieties. Benefiting from the multivalent assembly, a photocatalytically active supramolecular MPT dimer can be stably formed in TM&#8208;SOF. In addition, TM&#8208;SOF exhibits better stability against temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, TM&#8208;SOF shows a significantly improved performance for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aryl boronic acids and thioethers. It is anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance supramolecular photocatalysis systems.

         <title>Photochromic Fentanyl Derivatives for Controlled &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>

Photoresponsive fentanyl&#8208;based ligands provide the opportunity to spatially, temporally, and non&#8208;invasively regulate &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor activity by using light. The repertoire of such ligands has been expanded in this work, yielding a desirable selection that differ in photophysical properties and/or metabotropic response.







Abstract
Photoswitchable ligands as biological tools provide an opportunity to explore the kinetics and dynamics of the clinically relevant &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor. These ligands can potentially activate or deactivate the receptor when desired by using light. Spatial and temporal control of biological activity allows for application in a diverse range of biological investigations. Photoswitchable ligands have been developed in this work, modelled on the known agonist fentanyl, with the aim of expanding the current &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of fentanyl photoswitchable ligands. In doing so, ligands have been developed that change geometry (isomerize) upon exposure to light, with varying photophysical and biochemical properties. This variation in properties could be valuable in further studying the functional significance of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor.

         <title>Reaction of Pertechnetate in Highly Alkaline Solution: Synthesis and Characterization of the Nitridotrioxotechnetate Ba[TcO3N]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot chemistry. The nitridotrioxotechnetate anion has been obtained by the reaction of ammonium pertechnetate under highly alkaline conditions. In addition to a single crystal structure analysis, Raman data proves the existence of Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N bonds. The oxidation state +VII has further been corroborate by XANES and EXAFS measurements.







Abstract
The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the 
 anion, our recent investigation yielded the new 
 anion. Brown single crystals of Ba[TcO3N] were obtained under hydrothermal conditions starting from Ba(OH)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O and NH4[TcO4] at 200&#8201;&#176;C. 
 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/n (a=7.2159(4)&#8197;&#197;, b=7.8536(5)&#8197;&#197;, c=7.4931(4)&#8197;&#197; and &#946;=104.279(2)&#176;). The crystal structure of 
 consists of isolated 
 tetrahedra, which are surrounded by Ba2+ cations. XANES measurements complement the oxidation state +VII for technetium and Raman spectroscopic experiments on Ba[TcO3N] single crystals exhibit characteristic Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N vibrational modes.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Redox&#8208;Active Bis(aldimine) Ligand Bridged Diruthenium Complex Possessing Singlet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;centered dioxygen activation and oxygenation of bis(aldimine) core have been highlighted on a dinuclear Ru platform utilizing the concept of spin isomerism at the redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;ligand interface. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The unexplored &#8216;actor&#8217; behavior of redox&#8208;active bis(aldimine) congener, p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(picoline)aldimine (L1), towards dioxygen activation and subsequent functionalization of its backbone was demonstrated on coordination with {Ru(acac)2} (acac= acetylacetonate). Reaction under aerobic condition led to the one&#8208;pot generation of dinuclear complexes with unperturbed L1, imino&#8208;carboxamido (L2&#8722;), and bis(carboxamido) (L32&#8722;)&#8208;bridged isovalent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L1)RuII}, 1/ {RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L32&#8722;)RuIII}, 3 and mixed&#8208;valent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L2&#8722;)RuIII}, 2. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations. Kinetic and isotope labelling experiments together with DFT analyzed transition states justified the consideration of redox shuttling at metal/L1 interface for 3O2 activation despite of the closed shell configuration of 1 (S=0) to give carboxamido derived 2/3.

Sometimes things just gel: Glycoconjugate (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco in which a d&#8208;glucosamine moiety was attached to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus showed hierarchical self&#8208;aggregation leading to the formation of transparent, injectable, and biocompatible hydrogel. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco nanocomposite hydrogel bearing AgNPs can be applied topically as an antibacterial soft material. Solvent&#8208;dependent chiral inversion was demonstrated in the aggregates of a (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco&#8208;bearing l&#8208;leucine unit.







Abstract
We have shown solvent&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent chiral inversion of a few glycoconjugate supramolecules. (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco, in which d&#8208;glucosamine has been attached chemically to Cbz&#8208;protected l&#8208;phenylalanine at the C&#8197;terminus, forms a self&#8208;healing hydrogel through intertwining of the nanofibers wherein the gelators undergo lamellar packing in the &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures with a single chiral handedness. Dihybrid (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco nanocomposite gel was prepared by in&#8208;situ formation of silver nanoparticles AgNPs in the gel; this enhances the mechanical properties of the composite gel through physical crosslinking without altering the packing pattern. In contrast, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco bearing an l&#8208;leucine moiety does not form a hydrogel but an organogel. Interestingly, the chiral handedness of the aggregates of (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco can be reversed by choosing suitable solvents. In addition to self&#8208;healing behavior, (Z)&#8208;L&#8208;gluco gel revealed shape persistency. Further, (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel is benign, nontoxic, non&#8208;immunogenic, and non&#8208;allergenic in animal cells. AgNP&#8208;loaded (Z)&#8208;F&#8208;gluco hydrogel showed antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Discriminating Chiral Supramolecular Motions by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions from the molecular level to the macroscopic scale were discriminated by circularly polarized luminescence, which was associated with the stage of assembly and the geometry of the hierarchically organized particles.







Abstract
Molecular motions are closely associated with the behaviors and properties of organic materials. However, monitoring molecular motions is challenging. Herein, a chiral supramolecular system consisting of L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF/DPF) as a chiral inducer and an achiral tetraphenylethene derivative (TPEF) as a molecular rotor has been proposed and explored for real&#8208;time discriminating the supramolecular motions by the visualization of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal variations. Derived from the ordered molecular motions of TPEF induced by LPF/DPF, highly organized aggregates have been progressively assembled in a controlled manner with differentiated morphologies, including spherical particles, one&#8208;dimensional fibers, and floor&#8208;shaped supercrystals. Notably, increasing level of ordered aggregates, in turn, led to quenching emissions, while the CPL signals have been dramatically amplified accompanying by a sharp enhancement of luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) from nearly 0 to &#8722;0.1. The significant amplification of CPL is attributed to the ordered aggregates of supramolecules, leading to the decrease of electric transition dipole moments in supramolecular system. As a result of the chiral supramolecular motions powered by supramolecular crystallization, the supramolecular motions are conveniently discriminated by visual CPL signal variation with an enhancement of glum value from 0 to &#8722;0.1 in real time.

         <title>Fusion of Aza&#8208; and Oxadiborepins with Furans in a Reversible Ring&#8208;Opening Process Furnishes Versatile Building Blocks for Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Materials</title>

Merging furan rings with 1,2,7&#8208;oxa&#8208; and &#8208;azadiborepins. This modular synthesis proceeds through a reversible ring&#8208;opening process and furnishes the novel heteropolyaromatic compounds from a common precursor. The tricyclic systems are overall aromatic, and weak aromaticity in the diboron heterocycles favors &#960; electron delocalization over the bifuran unit. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is easily extended through the &#945;&#8208;positions of the furan rings.







Abstract
A modular synthesis of both difurooxa&#8208; and difuroazadiborepins from a common precursor is demonstrated. Starting from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran, after protection of the positions 5 and 5&#8217; with bulky silyl groups, formation of the novel polycycles proceeds through opening of the furan rings to a dialkyne and subsequent re&#8208;cyclization in the borylation step. The resulting bifuran&#8208;fused diborepins show pronounced stability, highly planar tricyclic structures, and intense blue light emission. Deprotection and transformation into dibrominated building blocks that can be incorporated into &#960;&#8208;extended materials can be performed in one step. Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Dinuclear Platinum(II) Compound: Mechanism and Roles of an Upper Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior of a dinuclear Pt(II) compound and two up&#8208;conversion channels are found to contribute TADF at 300&#8197;K: the direct T1&#8594;S1 channel and the T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 one. Both channels contribute to TADF.







Abstract
A dinuclear Pt(II) compound was reported to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF); however, the luminescence mechanism remains elusive. To reveal relevant excited&#8208;state properties and luminescence mechanism of this Pt(II) compound, both density function theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out in this work. In terms of the results, the S1 and T2 states show mixed intraligand charge transfer (ILCT)/metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand CT (MLCT) characters while the T1 state exhibits mixed ILCT/ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal CT (LMCT) characters. Mechanistically, a four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior. The reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process from the initial T1 to final S1 states involves two up&#8208;conversion channels (direct T1&#8594;S1 and T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 pathways) and both play crucial roles in TADF. At 300&#8197;K, these two channels are much faster than the T1 phosphorescence emission enabling TADF. However, at 80&#8197;K, these rISC rates are reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very small, which blocks the TADF emission; instead, only the phosphorescence is observed. These findings rationalize the experimental observation and could provide useful guidance to rational design of organometallic materials with superior TADF performances.

         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion has been selectively prepared and arises as an analogue of [NiF4]2&#8722;, but featuring the discrete tetrahedral geometry of the heavier halonickelates. This high&#8208;spin complex has enabled the investigation of the electronic properties of the [OTeF5]&#8722; group in coordination chemistry, showing that it behaves as the fluoride also in ligand&#8208;field terms.







Abstract
The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8722; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8722;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].

         <title>Vinylic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic substrates was performed through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8722;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8722;H bonds is described. The 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;&#8208;substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a microwave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction. With &#946;&#8208;substituted substrates lower yields, but still satisfactory, are obtained. This methodology was also successfully extended to other fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method is applicable across a diverse array of readily accessible substrates, accessing a broad range of synthetically useful products containing versatile stereodefined internal alkenes. Synthetic and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the isomerization proceeds along competing 1,2&#8208;hydride shift and hydride abstraction pathways.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Unravels Supramolecular Chirality and Hydration Polymorphism of Nucleoside Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>

Supramolecular VCD of nucleoside crystal solvomorphs: Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of guanosine microcrystals exhibit sign inversion upon reversible crystal hydration/dehydration. Such spectral changes occur due to alteration of molecular arrangement in the crystal. Supramolecular chirality of the crystals brings about two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of the VCD signal, thus enabling almost instantaneous spectra measurements. This could be utilized in pharmaceutical industry, e.&#8201;g. for quality and stability control.







Abstract
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid&#8208;state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals is now presented. A two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed to obtain high&#8208;quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. The VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order and is able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supramolecular VCD of nucleoside crystal solvomorphs&lt;/b&gt;: Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of guanosine microcrystals exhibit sign inversion upon reversible crystal hydration/dehydration. Such spectral changes occur due to alteration of molecular arrangement in the crystal. Supramolecular chirality of the crystals brings about two-orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the VCD signal, thus enabling almost instantaneous spectra measurements. This could be utilized in pharmaceutical industry, e.&#8201;g. for quality and stability control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid-state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals is now presented. A two-orders-of-magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed to obtain high-quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. The VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order and is able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples. This study demonstrates that VCD is capable of near-instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4&#8201;and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>

Uronic acids have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. The competing intramolecular stabilization in uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied using infrared ion spectroscopy and computational energy landscape maps. This reveals how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.







Abstract
Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein, the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS reveals that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, in which the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is cis, and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is trans. Isomer&#8208;population analysis and interconversion barrier computations show that the two bridged structures are not in dynamic equilibrium and that their ratio parallels the density functional theory computed stability of the structures. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.

         <title>Stabilization of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite by Boron Substitution for the Production of Commercially Applicable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron substitution stabilizes the extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite EWT and increases its thermal stability to 850&#8201;&#176;C. B atoms preferentially substitute the interrupted Q3 sites and are partially converted into 3&#8208;coordination to relax framework deformation upon heating. After Al&#8208;reinsertion post&#8208;treatment, it shows higher ethylbenzene selectivity and ethylene conversion rate than commercial ZSM&#8208;5 and Beta zeolite in benzene alkylation reaction.







Abstract
Stable extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites are desirable for industrial purposes due to their ability to accommodate bulky reactants and diffusion through channels. Although there are several extra&#8208;large pore zeolites reported, stable ones are rare. Thus, their stabilization is a feasible strategy for industrial applications. Here, an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite EWT with boron substitution is presented, and the resulting zeolite B&#8208;RZM&#8208;3 increased the thermal stability from 600&#8201;&#176;C in its silica form to 850&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure, determined by combining continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), shows that B atoms preferentially substitute the interrupted (HO)T(OT)3 (Q3) sites and are partially converted into 3&#8208;coordination to relax framework deformation upon heating. After Al&#8208;reinsertion post&#8208;treatment, Al&#8208;B&#8208;RZM&#8208;3 shows higher ethylbenzene selectivity and ethylene conversion rate per mol acid site than commercial ZSM&#8208;5 and Beta zeolite in benzene alkylation reaction. Synthesizing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite in borosilicate form is a potential approach to stabilize interrupted zeolites for commercial applications.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Dipole and Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interaction Manipulation Synergistically Enhance Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of AIEgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed to enhance the binding affinity of dyes toward pathogenic bacteria and to construct highly efficient luminescence&#8208;guided antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature independent of light and the surrounding oxygen.







Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria infections, especially multidrug resistant bacteria infections have aroused worldwide attention due to their severe threats to human beings. Thus, the development of highly effective antibacterial reagents is very important. However, the design of antimicrobials is still quite challenging for the lack of a universal design strategy. Here, a synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed for constructing highly efficient antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Firstly, four anion&#8208;&#960;+&#8208;type AIE luminogens were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron&#8208;donating and hydrophilic characteristic of methoxy groups, 3MOTPO containing three methoxy groups showed the largest dipole moment (5.06 Debye) and dual anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions in the solid state. Driven by both dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, 3MOTPO showed the strongest bacterial binding ability and the best antibacterial activities (MIC90=3.76&#8197;&#956;M). The work offers a deep insight into the rational design of highly efficient antimicrobials for luminescence&#8208;guided antibacterial study.

         <title>Frontispiece: Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylfluorination of Alkenes: A Powerful New Approach to Organofluorine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylfluorination can be considered not as a chemical procedure for the functionalization of an olefin bond, but a building blocks game in which various interesting models are constructed from versatile buliding elements (fluorine and aryl moieties). For more details of this powerful and versatile method, see the Review by L. Kiss et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202076).

A single pentagon defect in a single&#8208;layered graphene catalyst is emphasized next to a control structure (pentagon ring passivated by oxygen). The small molecules near the defect represent the reactant and intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction. Lightning around the graphene indicates how the pentagon defect was fabricated with electro&#8208;assistance and the oxygen reduction reaction was driven by electrical energy. More information on identifying the catalyst's precise active site can be found in the Research Article by F. Qiu, L. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202700).

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based Photochromic Delivery Vehicles for Ions and Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 63, November 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based supramolecular photochromic scaffold for the light&#8208;controlled binding and release of the guest molecules such as anions, cations, and neutral molecules have been demonstrated. These smart photochromic&#8208;hosts display light&#8208;induced change in molecular recognition and thus can act as the light&#8208;driven delivery vehicle for the external analytes.







Abstract
Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various molecular and ionic species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospects of the field.

Multitasking: One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination, which simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is often beneficial to their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties or bioactivity. As a consequence, organofluorine compounds have become quite common amongst drugs and agrochemicals, and their preparation is a highly important topic in both synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination of alkenes. It is an olefin difunctionalization process that simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an alkene framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of five iodido antimonates with structurally very similar anions has been prepared, and the influence of the anion's size on the band gap and the presence of additional charge&#8208;transfer effects was investigated.







Abstract
Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used for metal halide perovskites. Due to the variable anion structures in group 15 halogenido metalates, similar family relations are still largely missing. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2nI6n+4]4&#8722; family of anions, including the first n=5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz=pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n=1&#8211;5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72&#8197;eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8722; unit, as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, thus providing a framework for understanding new and known compounds in this emerging class of materials.

         <title>Simultaneous Loading of Ni2P Cocatalysts on the Inner and Outer Surfaces of Mesopores P&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Splitting Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2P cocatalysts were simultaneously loaded on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres to boost photocatalytic water splitting. The obtained Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P shows a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. The findings guide the design of composite photocatalysts and the better utilization of hollow nanostructured semiconductors for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. A simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P photocatalyst is reported. Ni2P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.

Calcium hydride cation dimer catalysis: Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations reveal that the same double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer catalyst [LCaH2CaL]2+&#8901;THF shows a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic activity, involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for efficient H2 isotope exchange, terminal Ca&#8722;H bond for the Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene, and competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH2CaL]2+ (macrocyclic ligand L=NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me4TACD) exhibited remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H2 isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via the terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH+. In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H2 isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Network Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited State Formation Within a Two&#8208;fold Catenated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically complementary linkers of the same framework are a well&#8208;studied pathway to achieve the photo&#8208;excited charge transfer state in a framework structure. Here, we show a mostly undiscovered strategy, how intercatenated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) endows ground&#8208;state donor&#8208;acceptor interaction from two networks of the same framework to facilitate the inter&#8208;net charge&#8208;transfer excited state through direct photo&#8208;excitation rendering the possibility in the energy conversion scheme.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, are shown to be excellent photocatalysts in a range of different reactions, benchmarked against the widely used donor&#8208;acceptor TADF photocatalyst, 4CzIPN. Advantages of using these MR&#8208;TADF photocatalysts include robust and inexpensive photocatalyst synthesis, lower required photocatalyst loadings and faster reaction rates, while achieving comparable or improved product yields.

Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist's collection of photocatalysts.

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral boryl radicals containing intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(II)Br&#8208;B(III) adducts were prepared by one&#8208;electron reduction of biphenylene and 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene substituted haloboranes. The radical features a large spin density on the boron center and its stabilization is assisted by a weak B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) &#963; interaction.







Abstract
The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by &#960;&#8208;system and the steric hinderance from bulky groups. Herein, a new class of boryl radicals is reported, with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) adducts ligated by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by the CAAC ligand and a weak but significant B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8722;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound were found, which could respond reversibly to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat) by elastic bending, rolling and jumping.







Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.

Messages from the cell: The cover picture honors the sensitivity of nitroxide labels combined with EPR spectroscopy in reporting on protein structure dynamics inside bacterial cells. We have demonstrated, in particular, that NarJ protein can be investigated at room temperature within 15&#8197;minutes, conditions that allow the preservation of both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.

         <title>Design Concepts for Solution and Solid&#8208;State Emitters &#8211; A Modern Viewpoint on Classical and Non&#8208;Classical Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shine a light! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so&#8208;called solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide&#8208;ranging applications in the near future.







Abstract
For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESIPT&#8208;type resorcin[4]arenes are capable of guest&#8208;binding in the cavity and generate FL response with large Stokes shift and size&#8208;selective enhancement of emission via the mechanism that involves (a) selective di&#8208;deprotonation, (b) generation of emissive double keto tautomeric forms, and (c) recognition&#8208;induced restriction of intramolecular motion.







Abstract
Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ESIPT-type resorcin[4]arenes&lt;/b&gt; are capable of guest-binding in the cavity and generate FL response with large Stokes shift and size-selective enhancement of emission via the mechanism that involves (a) selective di-deprotonation, (b) generation of emissive double keto tautomeric forms, and (c) recognition-induced restriction of intramolecular motion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core-fluorescent cavitands based on 2-(2&#8242;-resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (&lt;b&gt;RBI&lt;/b&gt;s) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation-selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. &lt;i&gt;Ab initio&lt;/i&gt; calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non-macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non-macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;way protection: O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde esters are suitable handles for the site&#8208;specific protection of N&#8208;terminal cysteines on native peptides. The resulting phenolic thiazolidines present tunable stability through careful pH control that allows the orthogonal multifunctionalization of different Cys residues driven by interactive site&#8208;selective peptide modifications.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low&#8208;micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with subsequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety to the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed at acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys, which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site.

         <title>G&#8208;type Halohydrin Dehalogenases Catalyze Ring Opening Reactions of Cyclic Epoxides with Diverse Anionic Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases convert 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered cyclic epoxides with a range of small anionic C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing cobalt chloride complexes under a dinitrogen atmosphere, cobalt dinitrogen complexes and binuclear cobalt tetra&#8208;dinitrogen complexes were formed. The cobalt dinitrogen complex could react with white phosphorus to afford a dinuclear cobalt complex bearing a cyclo&#8208;P4 moiety.







Abstract
By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl2, the corresponding cobalt chlorides (1, LCoIICl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt3 under a N2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b), were successfully obtained. 15N2&#8208;labeled [15N2]&#8208;2&#8201;a was prepared under 15N2/14N2 exchange in THF solution. LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL complex 2&#8201;a could react with P4 molecules to release N2 and generate a Co&#8722;P4&#8722;Co moiety 4. Further reduction of complex 2&#8201;b led to cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand to provide novel &#956;&#8208;PCy2&#8208;bridged Co0&#8722;N2 complex 5. DFT calculations confirmed the experimental observations.

         <title>Constructing Netlike Nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with Heterojunction as Robust Material for Electrochemical Amine Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO/BiOCl heterojunction material is fabricated by constructing netlike ZnO and BiOCl nanosheets. It exhibits high selectivity to ammonia and detection limit is 0.25&#8197;&#956;M, which is suitable to detect volatile amines quantitatively. The synergetic effects of the heterojunction and netlike structures contribute to boosting electrochemical activity. The ZnO/BiOCl hybrid could be an promising candidate for detection and analysis.







Abstract
The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1 and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25&#8197;&#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R2=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox potential of ruthenium(II) complexes were tuned with the aim to expand their applicability as photocatalyst for synthetic conversion. This resulted in an extended scope of the photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines using a new ruthenium complex as photocatalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst were tuned by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines was demonstrated under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst giving the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via carbon&#8208;phosphorus (C&#8722;P) bond formation.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the electron transport chain in natural photosynthesis, we propose a strategy to construct an electron transport channel in a model artificial photocatalyst, C3N4&#8722;TiO2 (BN&#8722;BR/CN) by electron transport layer engineering through a homophase junction (BN&#8722;BR). The electrons generated in CN under visible light can be contiunuously extracted and migrated along CN,BR TiO2, and BN TiO2, resulting in the synergistic optimization of photoabsorption and charge separation, and boosting H2 evolution. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202007).

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log  P  (CF2&#8208;CH2)  values, i.e. the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH  2  /CF  2  replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8208;1.4 units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational prference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceleration Effect of Bowl&#8208;shaped Structure in Aerobic Oxidation Reaction: Synthesis of Homosumanene ortho&#8208;Quinone and Azaacene&#8208;Fused Homosumanenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho &#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planer and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl. Azaacenohomosumanenes exhibited high electron affinity due to the combination of buckybowl and electron&#8208;deficient azaacene moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton induced defect&#8208;rich vanadium oxides as reversible polysulfide conversion sites for high performance lithium sulfur battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery has attracted attentions due to its high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery life. Herein, we successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and it was utilized as the functional interface layer on separator in Li&#8208;S battery. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Besides, the extra graphene layer also contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, the Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1 C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve the high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key steps in the industrial applications of energy conversion and storage. Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less&#8208;noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO&#8208;like materials have attracted board attentions as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton bearing sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of the para&#8208;substituents (R = Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe)&#160;the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R = H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208;, and methyl derivatives&#160;were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the pMeO&#160;and thioxanthenyl system&#160;were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative&#160;with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8208;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence to the hypervalent apical 3c&#8208;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A&#160;Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although perovskites show excellent optoelectronic properties leading to unprecedented efficiency increases of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their polycrystalline films present a number of defect states, especially concentrated on the surface, which seriously affects device efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Numerous works have reported various organic ammonium salts (OASs) to reduce defect states on the surface of the perovskite film. However, diverse roles of OASs are proposed and a guideline for reasonably selecting an OAS to treat the perovskite film is still lacked. Herein, we summarize recent works regarding the surface treatment of the perovskite film with OASs and discuss various roles that OASs play. Furthermore, we reveal how key factors, including chemical environment of the perovskite surface, types of OASs, and annealing temperature, influence the roles of OASs. This review could provide clues for understanding working mechanisms of OASs and for selecting appropriate OASs to improve the PSC performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(Si i Pr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate,  i Pr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R = Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KO t Bu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(Si i Pr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(Si i Pr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R = Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(Si i Pr 3 )(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R = Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and  i Pr3SiPCO.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium: Si&#8208;H Hydride Abstraction and Phosphorous&#8208;Ligand Cooperative Activation of C&#8208;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorous catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorous&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenicity of Tetrazine&#8208;Modified Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TTwo green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i)&#160;sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii)&#160;structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;&#160;284,000&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Erythrose and Threose: Carbonyl Migrations, Epimerizations, Aldol, and Oxidative Fragmentation Reactions Under Plausible Prebiotic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is considered to be a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a simple two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived&#160;from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has a high water evaporation rate of 1.52 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94 % under one sun irradiation, which is among the best values reported thus far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1 m2 g&#8208;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity&#160;of the Mo2C&#160;photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.</dc:description>

Vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions.







Abstract
The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.

         <title>Probing Cell&#8208;Surface Interactions in Fungal Cell Walls by High&#8208;Resolution 1H&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy can be applied for in&#8208;depth characterization of the Schizophyllum commune cell wall architecture and composition, as well as the elucidation of cell surface&#8208;level interactions. The obtained results reveal the relative abundance and arrangement of the polysaccharide and polypeptide layers and their significance in the binding of ligands to the fungal cell wall.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non&#8208;destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component, solvent&#8208;dependent, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of benzaldehydes, silyl enolates and arene nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of potential drug candidate 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;indanones. This reaction features the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds, high regioselectivity in a one&#8208;pot strategy, broad substrate generality, facile scalability (1.04g), high functional group tolerance and viable substrates. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;silyl ethers generated in&#8208;situ from the Mukaiyama aldol reaction were subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed benzylic arylation with strong as well as weak nucleophiles, and the resultant &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl esters can undergo a third C&#8722;C bond formation with excellent regioselectivity through intramolecular cyclization to afford the indanone products in the same pot. Detailed mechanistic insight leads to a feasible reaction pathway. This transformation opens up a practical and adaptable approach to producing a variety of synthetically valuable transformations and enable the synthesis of medicinally valuable (R)&#8208;tolterodine and (+)&#8208;indatraline.

         <title>Stacking Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacking interactions turn on halogen &#963;&#8208;hole in unactivated chloro&#8208; and bromo&#8208;arenes which are thus enabled to function as good halogen bonding donors.







Abstract
The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArX (ArX=PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Cl, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Br, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br2C6H4) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5&#8197;kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (12.5&#8197;kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.

         <title>Efficient Photoredox Cycles to Control Perylenediimide Self&#8208;Assembly
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreduction can be used to disassemble perylenediimide&#8208;based supramolecular structures by creating repulsive dianions. Typically, photoreductions are done in oxygen&#8208;free conditions. Here we show that &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; by acetone ketyl radicals is very efficient and can be done in open air. Repeated photoreduction/disassembly followed by oxidation/assembly cycles can in this way be performed by simple UV&#8722;C LED light.







Abstract
Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI&#8901;&#8722;) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI2&#8722;) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV2+). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.

         <title>A Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanol &#8208; 18O&#8208;Isotope Labeling and Stereogenic Probe Reveals Hidden Stereospecific Water Exchange Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silanols are important industrial building blocks for the functionalization of surfaces. In this research, one silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol was selectively synthesized and analyzed. By using an innovative combination of this stereochemical probe and isotope labeling, a configurationally stable chiral silanol was studied, providing new insights into mechanistic studies.







Abstract
A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with 18O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core Based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green phosphorescent OLED with a high external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;% and a long lifetime (LT50) of 89,000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 has been successfully developed by a spirobifluorene&#8208;based multifunctional hole transporter referred to as TDBFSBF1.







Abstract
Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is a suitable way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as TDBFSBF1 and TDBFSBF2 were effectively developed. TDBFSBF1 exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178&#8201;&#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5&#8197;eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, long operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance of 89,000&#8197;h, and low driving voltage at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 of 2.95&#8197;V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using TDBFSBF1. Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#956;h value of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was recorded in TDBFSBF2. A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#956;h values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core based HTLs.

         <title>Systematic Modulation of Thiol Functionalities in Inexpensive Porous Polymers for Effective Mercury Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple trickle trap: Mercury cations were captured by three thiol&#8208;modified porous polymers with precise sulfur content and chain length. Results show optimized binding with very high capacities and a unique hydrophobic/hydrophobic interplay with multidentate binding facilitates varying capture kinetics. Easily scaled up, these inexpensive solids could feasibly be used in cleaning mercury&#8208;laden water streams.







Abstract
Through accumulation, mercury contamination in aquatic systems still poses serious health risks despite the strict regulations on drinking water and industrial discharge. One effective strategy against this is adsorptive removal, in which a suitably functionalized porous material is added to water treatment protocols. Thiol (SH) group&#8208;grafted structures perform commendably; however, insufficient attention is paid to the cost, scalability, and reusability or how the arrangement of sulfur atoms could affect the HgII binding strength. We used an inexpensive and scalable porous covalent organic polymer (COP&#8208;130) to systematically introduce thiol functional groups with precise chain lengths and sulfur content. Thiol&#8208;functionalized COP&#8208;130 demonstrates enhanced wettability and excellent HgII uptake of up to 936&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, with fast kinetics and exceptionally high selectivity. These Hg adsorbents are easily regenerated with HCl and can be used at least six times without loss of capacity even after treatment with strong acid, a rare performance in the domain of Hg&#8208;removal research.

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 cycloaddition to N&#8208;alkyl aziridines was efficiently promoted by economic and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize protonated forms of porphyrin ligands. The metal&#8208;free procedure does not require the addition of any Lewis base or additive and allows N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones to be obtained in high yields and regioselectivities. A catalytic mechanism for the procedure is proposed on the basis of a DFT study.







Abstract
The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive, and shows interesting features both in terms of cost effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active even with a low catalytic loading of 1&#8201;% mol, and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed it to be recycled three times without any decrease in performance. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to yield oxazolidinones.

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and advanced Mosher&#8217;s method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A. thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes with controllable chiroptical properties: Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. A helicene bearing a phosphine oxide group exhibits a markedly enhanced CPL response in the excited state compared with that of such a helicene with a corresponding phosphine. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Usui, Y. Imai, S. Karasawa, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202922).

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules released by bacteria to acquire iron called siderophores have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically&#8208;approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically&#8208;relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus&#160;Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whilst a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Perfluoroalkylvinylation of Alkenes Enabled by Dual DBU/Fe Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript demonstrates a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual DBU/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8208;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8208;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active and selective catalysts pave the way for the production of bioplastics with tailor&#8208;made properties. Comonomers can be used to alter the properties of the prominent bioplastic PLA. Besides the variation in the microstructure, a treasure not yet fully uncovered lies within the combination of different monomer classes in multimechanistic polymerizations.







Abstract
Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. The copolymerization of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) has been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling copolymerizations remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerization of LA with other monomer classes is much less investigated, but has the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties that occur when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review, copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers, and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization conditions or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis: The increase in the degree of CN functionalization can regulate the D&#8208;A interaction with beneficial effects, such as broadened light absorption range, improved charge separation, enhanced interaction with Pt cocatalyst, and strengthened hydrophilicity, which achieves an excellent activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>Investigating the Active Oxidants Involved in Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Sulfoxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering peroxygenase activity into a P450 monooxygenase through mutations of the oxygen activation machinery resulted in a higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation compared to the WT enzyme. This implies the existence of a second oxidant capable of catalyzing sulfoxidation which is proposed to be the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex as proposed in theoretical work by Shaik.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of the C&#8722;H bonds of organic molecules. This reaction is initiated by a ferryl&#8208;oxo heme radical cation (Cpd I). These enzymes can also catalyze sulfoxidation reactions and the ferric&#8208;hydroperoxy complex (Cpd 0) and the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex have been proposed as alternative oxidants for this transformation. To investigate this, the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylthiobenzoic acids and 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid by the CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2 was compared using both monooxygenase and peroxygenase pathways. By examining mutants at the mechanistically important, conserved acid alcohol&#8208;pair (D251N, T252A and T252E) the relative amounts of the reactive intermediates that would form in these reactions were disturbed. Substrate binding and X&#8208;ray crystal structures helped to understand changes in the activity and enabled an attempt to evaluate whether multiple oxidants can participate in these reactions. In peroxygenase reactions the T252E mutant had higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation but in the monooxygenase reactions with the WT enzyme the activity of both reactions was similar. The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for O&#8208;demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for O&#8208;dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants it is proposed that this is the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide&#8208;driven reactions.

The activation of N2, CO2 or H2O to energy&#8208;rich products relies on multi&#8208;electron transfer reactions, and consequently it seems desirable to understand the basics of light&#8208;driven accumulation of multiple redox equivalents. Most of the previously reported molecular acceptors merely allow the storage of up to two electrons. We report on a terphenyl compound including two disulfide bridges, which undergoes four&#8208;electron reduction in two separate electrochemical steps, aided by a combination of potential compression and inversion. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the organic super&#8208;electron donor tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene, a cascade of light&#8208;induced reaction steps is observed, leading to the cleavage of both disulfide bonds. Whereas one of them undergoes extrusion of sulfur to result in a thiophene, the other disulfide is converted to a dithiolate. These insights seem relevant to enhance the current fundamental understanding of photochemical energy storage.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bridged Diphenyl Sulfones as Photoinduced Pnictogen Bond Forming Emission Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated pnictogen&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones as a new class of luminophores with photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that their emission dynamics could be ascribed to the photoinduced Pn&#8722;bond formation between a lone O pair in the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond. This is the first report on emission dynamics driven by pnictogen bond formation upon photoexcitation.

         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the one of most promising photovoltaic technologies that can be achieved by a simple solution process. At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) complex. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner. These results are shedding light to comprehend how to improve through&#8208;space conductivity thanks to sulfur enriched ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis acids with weakly basic ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great siginificance to develope high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieveing considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc. are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic organic framework&#8208;decorated leaf&#8208;like 2D nanosheets as flexible air cathode for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore highly active and robust self&#8208;supporting air electrode is the key for &#64258;exible Zn&#8208;air batteries (FZABs). Therefore, we report a novel 3D structural bimetal&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrode consisting of hybrid Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets on carbon cloth (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC), which displays excellent electrochemical activity and durability of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.863 V toward ORR and an overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 toward OER, owing to its exposed bimetallic sites accelerating kinetic reaction. In addition, the density functional theory calculation proves that the synergistic effect of CuCo sites favors ORR and OER. Hence, the FZABs based on Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC achieve a larger open&#8208;circuit potential (1.45 V), higher energy density (130.10 mW cm&#8208;2), and outstandingly cycling stability. All remarkable results demonstrate valuable enlightenment for seeking advanced energy materials of portable and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing a General Strategy to Break the C&#8208;C Bond of Benzene by a Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative addition of C&#8208;C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons by low valent main group species has attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental chemists due to the big challenge in breaking their aromaticity. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to break the C&#8208;C bonds in benzene by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results suggest that the activation of the C&#8208;C bond of benzene by this anion is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable whereas introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes such C&#8208;C bond activation becomes favorable both kinetically and thermodynamically. Such a sharp change on the kinetics and thermodynamics could be rationalized by the frontier molecular orbital theory by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the mono&#8208; and disubstituted benzenes. Aromaticity is found to stabilize the transition state for the ring open step. All these findings can help develop the chemistry of small&#8208;molecule activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Differences in the reactivity of geminal Si&#8211;O&#8211;P and Al&#8211;O&#8211;P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The new oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) is able to reversibly bind carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. We compared its reactivity towards benzil, but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one, nitriles and phenylacetylene to that of the Al/P FLP tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = &#8211;CH(SiMe3)2) (1). When reacted with benzil, both, 1 and 2, form the 1,2&#8208;addition product, but in the Si/P FLP 2, the second carbonyl function additionally binds to the silicon atom. With but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one 2 forms the 1,2&#8208;addition product, while 1 binds in 1,4&#8208;position. The reaction with acetonitrile yielded an unexpected etheneimine adduct for both systems, while only 1 reacted with tert&#8208;butylnitrile. With benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, 2 showed reversible addition to the C&#8801;N bond and 1 forms a stable adduct with benzonitrile. Solely 1 shows reactivity towards phenylacetylene affording a mixture of the CH deprotonation adduct tBu2P(H)&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2(CCPh) and the FLP&#8208;C&#186;C adduct under ring formation. All compounds were charac&#173;te&#173;rized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, XRD and elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescent Metal Halide Nanoclusters for Tunable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently limited by the inability of photosensitizers (PSs) to enter cancer cells and generate sufficient reactive oxygen species.&#160; Utilizing phosphorescent triplet states of novel PSs to generate singlet oxygen offers exciting possibilities for PDT. Here, we report&#160; phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters&#160; (NC) with tunable toxicity for PDT of cancer cells without use of rare or toxic elements. Upon irradiation with blue light, these molecules are excited to their singlet state and then undergo intersystem crossing to their triplet state. These NCs display surprising tunability of their cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity by modulating the apical halide ligand with a series of short chain fatty acids from trifluoroacetate to heptafluorobutyrate. The NCs are effective in PDT against breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer cells as well as their highly metastatic derivatives, demonstrating the robustness of these NCs in treating a wide variety of aggressive cancer cells. Furthermore, these NCs are internalized by cancer cells, remain in the lysosome, and can be modulated by the apical ligand to produce singlet oxygen. Thus, (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters are an excellent platform for optimizing PSs. Our results highlight the profound impact of molecular nanocluster chemistry in PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes by Uphill Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;dienes were selectively isomerized to their Z&#8208;isomers by uphill photocatalysis using blue LEDs and a catalytic amount of Ru(bpy)32+(PF6&#8722;)2 as the triplet sensitizer. It proved possible to directly convert alkyne and 1&#8208;alkene to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes by a one&#8208;pot procedure, offering a practical approach to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes which cannot be made directly by ene&#8208;yne metathesis.







Abstract
A variety of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes were isomerized from E to Z isomers by photocatalysis using Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 and blue LED light. Enrichment of the Z&#8208;isomer is thought to occur by selective triplet energy transfer from the photocatalyst to the stereoisomeric mixture. The 1,3&#8208;diene starting materials are easily made by catalytic ene&#8208;yne metathesis (EYM). To access 1,3&#8208;diene Z&#8208;stereoisomers directly, a one pot procedure was developed. Additional 1,3&#8208;dienes were investigated for both isomerization and Z&#8208;enrichment. The combination of cross EYM with photocatalysis allows for the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures by PVA&#8208;Assisted Freeze&#8208;Casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.







Abstract
Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&#8722;1, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.

         <dc:description>
Square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes bearing novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands display strong green&#8208;yellow emission in their monomeric form in tetrahydrofuran solution. Mixing the THF solutions with water results in aggregation of the complexes to afford nanospecies with clearly visible aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) that shifts the luminescent bands to the near infrared due to a metallophilic interaction between the starting molecular chromophores. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;P. Tunik and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202207).

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8722;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational analysis revealed iodonium ylides to possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing potentials, situated along the extensions of their C&#8722;I bonds. Experimentation revealed that formal O&#8722;H or S&#8722;H insertion reactions were possible with carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols. Halogen&#8208;bond activation is presumed to be essential, resulting in &#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls in 64&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield in five minutes.







Abstract
The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, with the more electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8722;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8722;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8208;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Based Crystalline Materials for Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials play an important role in the field of iodine host&#8208;guest chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progress of different types of cluster&#8208;based materials (such as cluster&#8208;based MOFs with different cluster nodes, metal&#8208;organic cages, macrocyclic molecules, and cluster composites) for iodine capture. The research status, possible iodine capture mechanisms and prospects of such crystalline materials are discussed.







Abstract
The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively. Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications. Herein, recent progress of different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture is reviewed. Research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A druggable intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several GPCRs. Ligands targeting the IABS are promising drugs and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Herein, we review small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of cellular target engagement for intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene assistant: The central ferrocene unit facilitates the designed monomer (1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains) to form supramolecular polymer (SP) by supporting higher enthalpy gain. The restricted rotational flexibility of ferrocene allows two azobenzene&#8208;dendritic arms to rotate freely, generating the best possible molecular conformation required for effective intermolecular interactions towards SP formation.







Abstract
Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies.

     alt="Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ferrocene assistant&lt;/b&gt;: The central ferrocene unit facilitates the designed monomer (1,n&#8242;-disubstituted ferrocene-azobenzene-long alkyl chains) to form supramolecular polymer (SP) by supporting higher enthalpy gain. The restricted rotational flexibility of ferrocene allows two azobenzene-dendritic arms to rotate freely, generating the best possible molecular conformation required for effective intermolecular interactions towards SP formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;-disubstituted ferrocene-azobenzene-long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH-Azo-TDP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball-bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H-bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV-Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An experimentalist removes one Pt atom from the capsule&#8208;like [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722; cluster lying on the conveyor that drags it through the computational frame. This deciphers an immediate transformation of the capsule&#8208;like architecture to the singly encapsulated double&#8208;cage structure in the reported [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; cluster that arises due to the insufficient support of the inner metal atom and electron deficiency of the Ge framework.

         <title>Modulating CoFeOX Nanosheets Towards Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas: Effect of Calcination Temperature and Mixed&#8208;Valence Multi&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer, abundant CO2 active adsorption sites exposure, and thus outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
CoFeOX nanosheets were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation and calcination method. The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal texture, morphology and surface areas of CoFeOX were fully explored. CoFeOX sample calcined at 600&#8201;&#176;C (CoFeOX&#8208;600) showed superior catalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 under visible light. Compared with the pure Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;sensitized CO2 reduction system, the CoFeOX&#8208;added system achieved 19&#8208;fold enhancement of CO production (45.7&#8197;&#956;mol/h). The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer and abundant CO2 active adsorption sites exposure, which promote the separation of photogenerated charges, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Carbon source of CO from CO2 was verified by 13CO2 isotopic labelling experiment. Repeated activity experiments confirmed the good stability of CoFeOX in the CO2 photoreduction system. This work would provide prospective insights into developing novel cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and durable non&#8208;precious metal cocatalysts to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of light&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds incorporates photochromic torsional switches (PTS). These compounds are able to tune the planarization of their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, and thus their optical and electronic properties, by using light as an external stimulus. The PTS unit is based on a bithiophene fragment linked to a photochromic azobenzene moiety. When this PTS&#8208;containing oligothiophene is not exposed to light, the azobenzene moiety assumes its extended trans conformation, which forces the oligothiophene backbone to twist out of coplanarity. Exposure to UV light results in isomerization to the cis conformation, which allows the bithiophene fragment to assume a planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Fazzi, E. Orentas, G. Sforazzini, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202698).

Cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene&#8208;anchored monoanionic phosphorus species have been introduced as the rising ligand to stabilize three unprecedented homo (AgI)&#8208; and mixed (Ag0/AgI)&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters Ag29, Ag12 and Ag8 in the solid state with defined structures. The neutral Ag29 and Ag8 clusters showed electron paramagnetic resonance at room temperature, whereas the green&#8208;emitting tri&#8208;cationic Ag12 cluster is diamagnetic and NMR active.

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclobutadiene dication was isolated and structurally characterized as a bis(tribromide) salt. Unlike the folded minimum structure calculated for the parent C4H42+ system, this dication exhibits a planar geometry in the solid state. However, calculations reveal a nearly isoenergetic folded isomer, and detailed studies employing advanced NICS methods show that, counterintuitively, cyclobutadiene dications are more aromatic when puckered rather than planar. For more information on this topic and related applications of diaminoacetylenes, see the Research Article by M. Tamm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202737).

         <title>Long&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells: Materials and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification via adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3 Symmetric Ph6&#8208;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>

         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach for the control of the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report on the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C 3 &#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexation Preferences of Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Adaptive Gene Vectors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing applications of therapeutic nucleic acids requires the concomitant development of vectors that are optimized to complex one type of nucleic acid, forming nanoparticles suitable for further trafficking and delivery. While fine&#8208;tuning a vector by molecular engineering to obtain a particular nanoscale organization at the nanoparticle level can be a challenging endeavor, we turned the situation around and instead screened the complexation preferences of dynamic constitutional frameworks toward different types of DNAs. Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCF) are recently&#8208;identified vectors by our group that can be prepared in a versatile manner through dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we designed and synthesized 40 new DCFs that vary in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, number of cationic headgroups. The results of DNA complexation obtained through gel electrophoresis and fluorescent displacement assays reveal binding preferences of different DCFs toward different DNAs. The formation of compact spherical architectures with an optimal diameter of 100&#8208;200 nm suggests that condensation into nanoparticles is more effective for longer PEG chains and PEI groups that induce a better binding performance in the presence of DNA targets.</dc:description>

         <title>A triazolium&#8208;anchored self&#8208;immolative linker enables self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driven siRNA binding and esterase&#8208;induced release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increased importance of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics&#160;comes with a need to develop next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive&#160;systems capable of binding, transporting and releasing RNA&#160;oligomers. In this work, we describe triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles&#160;capable of siRNA binding and enzyme&#8208;responsive release of the&#160;nucleic acid payload. In aqueous medium, the amphiphile selfassembles&#160;into nanocarriers that can disintegrate upon the addition of&#160;esterase. Key to the molecular design is a self&#8208;immolative linker that&#160;is anchored to the triazolium moiety and acts as a positively&#8208;charged&#160;polar head group. We demonstrate that addition of esterase leads to&#160;a degradation cascade of the linker, leaving the neutral triazole&#160;compound unable to form complexes and therefore releasing the&#160;negatively&#8208;charged siRNA. The reported molecular design and overall&#160;approach may have broad utility beyond this proof &#8208;of&#8208;principle study,&#160;because the underlying CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry allows bringing&#160;together three groups very efficiently as well as cleaving off one of the&#160;three groups under the mild action of an esterase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5 cm&#8211;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35 GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300 &#181;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1 &#181;s at 5 K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400 mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances on Dual&#8208;Functional Hosts for Polysulfides Conversion and Lithium Plating/Stripping towards Lithium&#8722;Sulfur  Full Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging&#160;research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterojunctions, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Direct oxidative coupling of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bond has been a great challenge. Herein, an environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles was reported. A vareity of diheteroaryl ketones were prepared in good yileds (up to 72%). This protocol features simple operation and broad substrates scope (26 examples). Significantly, a plausible mechanism about catalytic cycle was proposed, and two key intermediates were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Borylation and Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give&#160;Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolically stable C&#8208;glycosides are an essential family of compounds in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and biological probes. For their application, development of synthetic methods by connecting glycosides and aglycons with strict stereocontrol at the anomeric carbon as well as with high functional group compatibility and environmental compatibility is a pivotal issue. Although Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling using glycosyl boronates is a potential candidate for the construction of C&#8208;glycosides, neither the cross&#8208;coupling itself nor the facile synthesis of the coupling precursor, glycosyl boronates, have been achieved to date. Here, we succeeded in developing a Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to glycosyl boronates and Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to give aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, in which the &#946;&#8208;configuration of the anomeric carbon of the glycosyl trifluoroborates is stereoretentively transferred to that of the resulting aryl C&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The three group of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X = F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of their crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. The group of cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalen&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to take place trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously underwent in their crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in a,b&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Chiral and Tripodal Cavitands from &#946;&#8208;Pinene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant natural product &#946;&#8208;pinene can be rapidly converted into a library of chiral hosts that we call molecular tripods. As tripods complex chiral drugs in water, they hold promise for discovering and building novel sequestering agents, chemosensors or catalysts.







Abstract
We report Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoenone, obtained from monoterpene &#946;&#8208;pinene, into an enantiopure cyclotrimer. This C3 symmetric compound has three bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane rings fused to its central benzene with each ring carrying a carbonyl group. The cyclotrimer undergoes diastereoselective threefold alkynylation with the lithium salts of five terminal alkynes (41&#8211;63&#8201;%, de=4&#8211;83&#8201;%). The addition enabled a rapid synthesis of a small library of novel chiral cavitands that, in shape, resemble a tripod stand. These molecular tripods include a tris&#8208;bicycloannelated benzene head attached to three alkyne legs twisted in one direction to form a nonpolar cavity with polar groups as feet. Tripods with methylpyridinium and methylisoquinolinium legs, respectively, form inclusion complexes with anti&#8208;inflammatory and chiral drugs (R)/(S)&#8208;ibuprofen and (R)/(S)&#8208;naproxen. The mode of binding shows drug molecules docked in the cavity of the host through ion&#8208;ion, cation&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8722;&#960; contacts that, in addition of desolvation, give rise to complexes having millimolar to micromolar stability in water. Our findings open the door to creating a myriad of enantiopure tripods with tunable functions that, in the future, might give novel chemosensors, catalysts or sequestering agents.

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8208; Singly&#8208;Linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;Transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>

Covalently linked bisphosphoric acids deliver enhanced stereoselectivities compared to their monofunctional counterparts. The nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence. Based on a library of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, we could identify catalysts suitable for electrophilic fluorinations and for asymmetric transfer&#8208;hydrogenations.







Abstract
The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

HgII toxicity: HgII targets the intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site of DNA binding protein Rad50 to form the strongest metal complex in the living world and jeopardize the DNA repair mechanism.







Abstract
In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury's toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage&#8208;repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enables dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the Pyrococcus furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, PAC, and 199Hg&#8197;NMR spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments preferentially form homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH; this is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity&lt;/b&gt;: Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; targets the intermolecular Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-binding site of DNA binding protein Rad50 to form the strongest metal complex in the living world and jeopardize the DNA repair mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, thiolate-based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury's toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-thiolate coordination preferences, among which linear Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys-rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage-repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enables dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length-differentiated peptide models of the &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus furiosus&lt;/i&gt; zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with Hg&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. Using UV-Vis, CD, PAC, and &lt;sup&gt;199&lt;/sup&gt;Hg&#8197;NMR spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments preferentially form homodimeric Hg(Hk)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordination environment at physiological pH; this is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution.

         <title>Endoperoxides Compounds for Highly Efficient Cancer Treatment under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen is one of the most important reactive oxygen species, which can induce intracellular bio&#8208;molecule damage and oxidative stress. Constructing endoperoxides photosensitizers to supply singlet oxygen during photodynamic therapy can effectively tackle the problem of hypoxic cancer therapy. The introduction of endoperoxides compounds provides a novel and promising strategy for cancer treatment under hypoxia.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment has garnered tremendous attention with its promising non&#8208;invasiveness, low side effects, and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumours remains a serious resistant factor to reducing the effects of PDT. Endoperoxides are successfully utilized as the chemical storage or supplier of singlet oxygen (1O2), the active substance for PDT in materials and other domains. Recent reports indicated that this type of compound could remarkably enhance the therapeutic effects of PDT under hypoxia. This concept mainly introduces a few representative endoperoxides and the outlook of their potent application for treating hypoxic cancer cells.

         <title>Evidence for multiple binding modes in the initial contact between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and cell surface glycans
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than one way to get in: A hexasaccharide bound to site&#8197;I of the spike protein in two binding modes (orange and green tubes) shows that multiple binding modes between heparan sulfate (HS) and S1 (electrostatic potential map on the surface) are allowed. The hypothetical macromolecular complex HS&#8722;S1 does not interfere with the interaction involving S1&#8208;RBD and ACE2, thus supporting the co&#8208;receptor role of HS in the activation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein.







Abstract
Infection of host cells by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1&#8208;RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation. These two events promote the binding of S1&#8208;RBD to the angiotensin converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2) receptor, a preliminary step toward viral&#8208;cell membrane fusion. Combining ligand&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics, oligosaccharide analogues were used to explore the interactions between S1&#8208;RBD of SARS CoV&#8208;2 and HS, revealing several low&#8208;specificity binding modes and previously unidentified potential sites for the binding of extended HS polysaccharide chains. The evidence for multiple binding modes also suggest that highly specific inhibitors will not be optimal against protein S but, rather, diverse HS&#8208;based structures, characterized by high affinity and including multi&#8208;valent compounds, may be required.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer chain, which mimics the electron transport chain in natural photosynthetic system fabricated by the synergistic interfacial chemical bond and brookite TiO2 homophase junction promotes the charge separation efficiency in 2D carbon nitride.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C3N4 (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, it was found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO2 rods and nanoparticles (BN&#8208;BR) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in BN&#8208;BR/CN composites. The BN&#8208;BR/CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti&#8722;O&#8722;N between CN and brookite rods (BR) and BN&#8208;BR homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. This work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Metal Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can Activate Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nodes of various robust metal&#8208;organic frameworks activate H2. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of multiple bonds are among the most general and important organic reactions. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are based on transition metal nanoparticles, including noble metals. Data are presented here showing that metal nodes of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) and UiO&#8208;66 in the absence of occluded metal nanoparticles can promote hydrogenation of polarized X=Y double bonds of nitro and carbonyl groups. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.

Abstract
In summary, several imidazolylphosphine pincer ligands and the corresponding Mn complexes were synthesized, fully characterized, and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations. The complexes were tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed in excellent yields and high selectivity under very mild conditions using catalyst Mn&#8208;2&#8201;b. Spectroscopic studies support a classical metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism for the activation of the catalyst, revealing amido as well as hydrido species. A third species could also be observed, tentatively assigned as the tert&#8208;butoxy species MnOtBu&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8201;b. DFT supported these findings showing the possibility of equilibrium between all three catalyst species in the reaction. It further revealed higher kinetic reactivity as well as lower formation barrier for MnH&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8201;b over MnH&#8208;NH&#8208;1&#8201;b as likely causes for its improved reactivity.

         <title>NMR Investigations of Protein&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions: The Recognition of Glycans by Galectins Engineered with Fluorotryptophan Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine (  19  F) incorporation into glycan binding proteins (lectins) has been achieved and exploited to monitor the binding to carbohydrate ligands by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. Galectins are a family of lectins that bind carbohydrates, generally with weak affinities, through a combination of intermolecular interactions including a key CH&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction involving a conserved Trp residue. Herein, two galectins, Galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) and Galectin&#8208;8 (Gal8) with one and two (different) carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) respectively were selected. Gal3 contain only one Trp, while Gal8 contains three Trp, one at each CRD binding site and a third not involved in ligand binding, which were substituted by the corresponding F&#8208;Trp analogues. The presence of the fluorine did not significantly modify the affinity for glycan binding, which was in slow exchange in the  19  F NMR chemical shift time scale, even for weak ligands, and allowed to individualise binding events taking place at two different binding sites within the same lectin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials, but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, we used ethanol as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. We found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. We discovered, an initially immiscible synthesis method, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value to be extended to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946; &#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, we developed a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946; &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946; 2,3,3 &#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. Our protocol features in situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946; &#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of&#160;non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealedRh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as&#160;the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of nucleic acids as templates which can trigger the self&#8208;assembly of their own vectors represent an emerging, simple and versatile, approach toward the self&#8208;fabrication of tailored nucleic acids delivery vectors. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing this complex templated self&#8208;assembly process that accompanies the complexation of nucleic acids remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the class of arginine&#8208;rich dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) composed of different monomers varying the number and position of arginines. We describe the combinations that lead to nucleic acid complexation, in saline buffer, using different templates, from short siRNA to long DNA. Finally, we identify a successful peptidic DCP featuring six&#8208;arginine repeating unit that promote the safe and effective delivery of siRNA in live cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, i.e., the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination ("anti&#8208;Wacker"&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2&#160;Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are&#160;still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction&#160;(NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2&#160;and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3&#160;is identified as a&#160;high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8208;0.24 V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2&#160;and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2.&#160;Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3&#160;monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2&#160;electroreduction.&#160;This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides&#160;and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Thus, the selection of biometric molecules with good selectivity and high affinity is very important. Among them, peptide with lots of obvious advantages like good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, variety, strong functionality, flexible chemical modification, etc. has attracted numerous attentions. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the specific applications of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Edge Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates needed for conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for construction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined via a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization.&#160; The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12&#8208;14 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M= Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67 mV and 129 mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10 hours stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex&#8208;situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0 V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8211;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486 nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623 nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions</dc:description>

However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8208;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Screening of DalPhos/Ni Catalysts in C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;couplings of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides Enables Development of Aminopyrazole Cross&#8208;couplings with Amine Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several focused reports have appeared over the past few years documenting the utility of nickel catalysts featuring newly developed DalPhos bisphosphine ligands for C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings of typically challenging (hetero)aryl chlorides with targeted NH nucleophiles. Herein, a more expansive and systematic competitive evaluation of this ligand family in N&#8208;arylation chemistry is provided involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.g., unwanted C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, e.g., by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10 kcal mol&#8211;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: (i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and (ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrazole&#8211;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex  1  , that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8211;vis spectro&#8211;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex  1  . Infrared spectro&#8211;electrochemical studies under CO  2  and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8211;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO  2  . In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8211;site mechanism with up to 94% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47 M TFE were present, at &#8211;1.35 V  vs  Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39 V overpotential).

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: from Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>17  O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of  17  O (0.04%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient  17  O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides, using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to ~ 40%, yields ~ 60&#8208;85%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently,  17  O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/  t  Bu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective  17  O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with ~ 28% enrichment level. For all molecules,  17  O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices Through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella&#160;ambigua and the marine sponge Axinella sp., respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweaking the Optoelectronic Properties of S&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Chemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of&#160;peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2&#160;led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#160;p&#8208;p&#160;stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00&#160;= 2.99 eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their&#160;n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8208;1&#8208;10&#8208;2&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;and 10&#8208;2&#8208;10&#8208;3&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peri-thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S-doped analog of&#160;peri-xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S-atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri-thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2&#160;led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium-type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid-state arrangements with face-to-face&#160;p-p&#160;stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S-atoms, with the bis-sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00&#160;= 2.99 eV). While peri-thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their&#160;n-type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10-1-10-2&#160;S cm-1&#160;and 10-2-10-3&#160;S cm-1&#160;for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far. Finally, the electroluminescence properties of the complexes were tested in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), obtaining the first mid-emitting PAH-based LECs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting of polynucleotide (RNA and DNA) topologies and their protein complexes by small molecules has enormous potential in the discovery of new therapeutics across a broad range of diseases (infectious, chronic and congenital). Polynucleotides are very different structures to proteins and have a much greater capacity to form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitably &#960;&#8208;rich small molecules. To exploit this difference, we have developed a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis approach to &#960;&#8208;rich scaffolds from a common set of substrates. The utility of this approach has been exemplified in the discovery of a novel topoisomerase&#8208;1 inhibitor.







Abstract
Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs) are critically involved in the molecular pathways of disease. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimized through judicious incorporation of substituents on the scaffold to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Functionalities of Temporally Controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene conjugate acts as a conventional 1O2 sensor, a unique spatiotemporally controlled 1O2 sensor, or a good photosensitizer depending on the photoexcitation wavelengths. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the unique multifunctionality was achieved by the unique photoexcited states of the molecule. The molecular ability in living cells was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (RA) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i) RA acts as a conventional fluorogenic 1O2 sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with 1O2. (ii) RA acts as a temporally controlled 1O2 sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (&#8764;700&#8197;nm) photosensitization. RA enters an intermediate state after capturing 1O2 and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii) RA acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate 1O2 under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and RA shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in RA offer to promise molecular tools to apply 1O2 in a spatiotemporal manner.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides has been achieved. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl source. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding nitrogen heterocycles in moderate to good yields. Notably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.







Abstract
A new palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimorpholinoacetylene has been synthesized and structurally characterized as a new member of the class of electron&#8208;rich diaminoacetylenes. The new compound can be used to produce cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes or oxidized to give the first fully characterized cyclobutadiene dication. Detailed computational studies by NICS and current density calculations were carried out to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclobutadiene dications.







Abstract
The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (3) was prepared from 1,1&#8208;dimorpholinoethene (1) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal 2, which upon lithiation afforded 3 through a Fritsch&#8208;Buttenberg&#8208;Wiechell rearrangement. Heating 3 at elevated temperatures resulted in a complete conversion into the dimer 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1&#8208;buten&#8208;3&#8208;yne (4), which was used for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes of the type [(CBA)MLn] (5&#8208;7; MLn=AuCl, RhCl(COD), RhCl(CO)2; CBA=1,3,4,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). The reaction of 3 with tetraethylammonium bromide gave 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramorpholinocyclobutenylium bromide (8), which reacted with bromine to form 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra(morpholino)cyclobutenediylium bis(tribromide) (9). Compound 9 represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C4N4 core as shown by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.

Compound &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core as shown by X-ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines&#160;and Its Application in&#160;Host&#8208;Guest&#8208;Doped Strategy&#160;To Construct Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature&#160;Phosphorescence Materials for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives via a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction, which provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;range lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3 ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4r/BP nanoparticles could be utilized for in vivo imaging with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.</dc:description>

Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Riboswitches are 5'&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistances against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we could show that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis reaction followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.</dc:description>

The compounds 2a&#8208;f and 3a&#8208;f were characterised thoroughly by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal hydrogen bonding of the fluorido ligand with HF molecules and the indolylphosphine ligand. Polyfluorido complexes 2a&#8208;f show larger &#9474;1J(F,Pt)&#9474;, but lower 1J(H,F) coupling constants when compared to the fluorido complexes 3a&#8208;f. Decreasing 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants in 2a&#8208;f and 3a&#8208;f suggest a cis influence of the aryl ligands in the following order: 4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (a) &#8776; 4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (b) &lt; Ph (c) &lt;&lt; 4&#8208;FC6H4 (d) &lt; 4&#8208;ClC6H4 (e) &lt; 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (f). In addition, the larger cis influence of aryl ligands bearing electron withdrawing groups in the para position correlates with decreasing magnitudes of &#9474;1J(F,Pt)&#9474; coupling constants The interpretation of the experimental data was supported by quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations.</dc:description>

By combining carbazole and acridone units through pyridyl bridge, a bipolar host with highly twisted and rigid structure is developed, which guarantees the green phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs to exhibit remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
By linking the carbazole unit to the nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl or pyridyl, two compounds, named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl group as a linking group slightly improves the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz. The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V, a maximum power efficiency and an external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) of 89.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 25.2&#8201;%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge&#8208;balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of the pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, the AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz&#8208;hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6&#8201;% from the maximum next at a high brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9&#8201;% at an extremely high brightness of 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study manifests that acridone&#8208;based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy was proposed by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve photochemical fluorescence enhancement behavior, which provides a valuable design principle for photoconvertable fluorophores by controllably regulating photophysical processes and photochemical reactions of AIEgens.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for superstable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100&#8201;% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Liquid Crystal Dimers Bridged with a Phosphonic Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel synthesis strategy for facile access to a huge family of liquid crystal dimers or mono&#8208;addition homologues characterized with phosphonic group, which is readily achieved with P&#8722;C bonding through addition reaction between P&#8722;H and non&#8208;conjugated vinyl group. The introduced phosphonic group enables homeotropic alignment and further functionalization and one of the LC dimers exhibits NTB phase directly from the isotropic state.







Abstract
Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTB) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of NTB phase.
