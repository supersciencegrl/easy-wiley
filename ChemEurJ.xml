      <title>High&#8208;Pressure High&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE = Sr, Ba)</title>
      <dc:description>Tetrahedra based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides which upon doping with Eu  2+  exhibit intriguing luminescence properties that make them attractive for applications.

      <dc:description>BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic was prepared via the conventional solid&#8208;state method and sintered at 1100 &#176;C. XRD and synchrotron Rietveld refinement analyses revealed the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented monoclinic structure with a space group of P  2 1  /a (No.14), which was reported for the first time. The BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented a weak ferroelectricity, which was confirmed by the P&#8208;E  loop and the 90&#176; nanoscale ferroelectric domain. Although &#949;  r  &#8208; T  displayed two &#949;  r  abnormal peaks at 400 &#176;C and 460 &#176;C, the Curie temperature ( T  &#173; c  ) was located at 460 &#176;C according to the dielectric loss and Curie&#8211;Weiss law. Moreover, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic exhibited optimised microwave dielectric properties with &#949;  r  = 6.55, Q  &#215; f  = 52400 GHz, and &#964; f  = &#8722;24.5 ppm/&#176;C. Hence, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic in the ternary BaO&#8211;ZnO&#8211;SiO 2  system possessed both weak ferroelectricity and microwave dielectric properties.

      <dc:description>
A crystalline and ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) film was successfully synthesized at the air/water interface through [2+2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition. The self&#8208;assembly process induced from the strong donor&#8211;acceptor interactions realizes the pre&#8208;organization of the monomers which is the key role to keep the highly ordered structure in the subsequent photo&#8208;polymerization. Various microscopy techniques demonstrated the successful formation of the ultrathin, large&#8208;area, and free&#8208;standing 2DP film. TERS technology was applied to verify the successful polymerization. More importantly, the molecular structure of the 2DP was explicitly analyzed by a combination of SAED pattern and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.

      <title>Bifunctional Hydrogen Bond Donor&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions: Origin of Stereoselectivity and Rate Enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>
(Thio)ureas have found numerous applications as organocatalysts, yet their mode of action, that is, the mechanism by which they accelerate reactions is still not fully understood. In this work, quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal that these bifunctional hydrogen bond organocatalysts accelerate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and acrolein by reducing the two&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (steric) Pauli repulsion between the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the reactants and not by enhancing the donor&#8211;acceptor orbital interactions, as is traditionally considered.

      <title>Cationic zinc hydrides catalyzed CO2 reduction to formate: Deciphering elementary reactions, isolation of intermediates and computational investigations</title>
      <dc:description>Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc centre and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences CO  2  reduction. We have investigated these factors by exploring elementary reactions of CO  2  hydrosilylation and hydroboration using cationic zinc hydrides bearing the tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and the tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.</dc:description>

      <title>A Synthetic Strategy for Cofacial Porphyrin&#8208;Based Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple route to dimeric complexes: Three different types of covalently linked metalloporphyrin dimers were synthesized. The monomers were synthesized sequentially and can be filled with metals before linking. As a result, different heterobimetallic systems can be made. Depending on the metals M1 and M2 used (M=Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd), a wide range of potentially catalytically active species can be prepared, such as analogues of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.







Abstract
We present a straightforward and generally applicable synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin complexes. The protocol allows the synthesis of unsymmetrical aryl&#8208;based meso&#8208;meso as well as &#946;&#8208;meso&#8208;linked porphyrins. Our method significantly increases the overall yield for the published compound known as o&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bisporphyrin (OBBP) by a factor of 6.8. Besides the synthesis of 16 novel homobimetallic complexes containing MnIII, FeIII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, and PdII, we achieved the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of an unsymmetrical cofacial benzene&#8208;linked porphyrin dimer containing both planar&#8208;chiral enantiomers of a NiII2 complex. Additionally, this new methodology allows access to heterobimetallic complexes such as the FeIII&#8208;NiII containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase active site analogue. The isolated species were investigated by various techniques, including ion mobility spectrometry, DFT calculations, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This allowed us to probe the influence of interplane distance on Soret band splitting.

      <title>Frontispiece: Molecular Magnets: The Synthesis and Characterization of High&#8208;Spin Nitrenes</title>
      <dc:description>
The chemistry of high&#8208;spin nitrenes is a relatively new research field aimed at designing tunable organic molecules in which spin populations on the Zeeman levels may greatly vary, depending on the external magnetic field and temperature. Despite the fact that first reports on EPR spectra of quintet dinitrene 1 and septet trinitrene 2 were published 50&#8197;years ago, only recently, progress in molecular spectroscopy and computational methods opened the way to comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of these fascinating molecules containing several monovalent nitrogen atoms and large numbers of unpaired electrons. Such compounds have potential to be used in the future of molecular electronics such as quantum computers. The synthesis, spectroscopy, magnetic properties, and electronic structure of these paramagnetic species is discussed in the Minireview by S.&#8197;V. Chapyshev, E. Mendez&#8208;Vega, and W. Sander on page&#8197;1258&#8197;ff.

      <dc:description>Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins are flavonoids that are present in various food products (e.g. fruit, vegetables, wine, etc.). The large chemical diversity amongst these molecules leads to compound specific properties such as color and stability towards external conditions.

      <dc:description>A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min. were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling.

      <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>

Their structural and physical properties have been compared with the also newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu] and [GdYb], respectively) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between Eu(III) and Yb(III) does not occur to a significant extent, while emission from Yb(III) originates via sensitization from the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two Nd(III) centers in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], where Yb(III) luminescence is thus in part sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.</dc:description>

Making industry greener: Many principles for the economic production of organic bulk chemicals, the syntheses of which have potentially the highest environmental impact, currently overlap with principles of green chemistry. However, there remain enough challenges in making industrial organic synthesis even greener while keeping them efficient, which requires research and innovative processes. How efficient industrial organic chemistry can go hand in hand with principles of green chemistry is reflected in this Science Voices article.

      <title>Modulating rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces on nickel&#8208;copper double hydroxide nanotyres to pre&#8208;activate alkaline ammonia oxidation reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>The surface hydroxyls of NixCu1&#8208;x(OH)2  play a crucial role in governing their conversion efficiency into NixCu1&#8208;xOx(OH)  2&#8208;x  during the electro&#8208;chemical pre&#8208;activation process, thus affecting the integral ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reactivity. Herein, we for the first time report the rational&#160;design of hierarchical porous  NiCu double hydroxide  nanotyres (NiCu DHTs)  by  considering rich&#8208;hydroxyl interfaces to promote pre&#8208;activation efficiency and intrinsic structural superiority (i.e. annulus, porosity) to accelerate AOR kinetics. A systematic investigation of the structure&#8208;function&#160;relationship is conducted by manipulating a series of NiCu DHs with tunable intercalations and morphologies. Remarkably, the NiCu DHTs exhibit superior AOR activity (onset potential of 1.31 V with 7.52 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V) and high ammonia sensitivity (detection limit of 9 &#181;M), manifesting one of the best non&#8208;noble metal AOR electrocatalysts and electro&#8208;analytical electrodetectors.

      <title>Computational insight into the different mechanisms of Ag&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes and sulfonyl hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene can produce important cyclopropane products for synthesis intermediates, material and pharmaceutical applications. However, this reaction is often accompanied by side reactions such as coupling and self&#8208;coupling, so that the yield of cyclopropanation product of non&#8208;silver transition metal carbene and hindered alkene is generally lower than 50%. To solve this problem, addition of a low concentration of diazo compound (decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazones) to alkene catalyzed by either CuOAc or PdCl  2  was studied but side reactions still could not be avoided. Interestingly, however, the yield of cyclopropanation for such hindered alkenes was as high as 99% with AgOTf as catalyst. To explain this unexpected phenomenon, reaction pathways have been computed for four different catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). By combining the results of these calculations with the experimental ones, we concluded that the efficiency of the silver catalyst is due to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step, and the kinetic inhibition of side reaction by a high concentration of alkene.</dc:description>

Mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is enabled by a cooperative catalysis based on merging Pd0/PdII redox and PdII /PdII non&#8208;redox catalytic cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An Electron&#8208;Accepting aza&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>
      <dc:description>A bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) approach using an aza&#8208;BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron&#8208;accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) to elaborate a D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with the enhanced fluorescence brightness up to 0.5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8211;1cm&#8211;1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behaviors in emission. The transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#160;&#956;J cm&#8211;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembled binaphthyl&#8208;bridged amphiphilic AABB phthalocyanines: nanostructures for efficient antimicrobial photodynamic&#160;therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral Zn(II)Pcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents) containing differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in water media and have proved efficient in the photoinactivation of S. aureus and E. coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The size average of the nanoparticles is determined by the substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, it influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a non&#8208;substituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PS present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective in killing both types of strains, showing an outstanding photoinactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.</dc:description>

This unique property enables a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remains structural intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. In summary, the photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies allows manipulating the subtle equilibria in the given system. We demonstrate this for the case of tetranuclear europium helical cage that is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, we bring the experimental evidence that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky noncoordinating counterions that may trigger self&#8208;assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with noncoordinating anions enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;linking by 1,1'&#8208;Biphenyl Analogues: Substituents and Leaving Groups Combine to Determine the Efficiency of Cross&#8208;Linker</title>
      <dc:description>Two series of 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L = OAc, OCH  3  , OCHCH=CH  2  , OCH  2  Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph  3  P  +  ) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8208;43%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (  2a)  , ether (  2b  and  2c)  , or triphenylphosphonium salt (  2g  ) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8764; 30%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.</dc:description>

Due to the frontier molecular orbital energy alignments of Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, the sublayer Chl&#8208;1 is a simulation of PSI whereas the upper layer Chl&#8208;2 is equivalent to PSII, and the resultant electron transport can take place from Chl&#8208;2 to Chl&#8208;1. Under the illumination of visible light (&gt; 420 nm), the HER performance of Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx  photocatalysts was found to be as high as 143 &#956;mol/h/gcat  , which was substantially higher than that of photocatalysts of either Chl&#8208;1@Ti3C2Tx  (20 &#956;mol/h/g) or Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx  (15 &#956;mol/h/g).</dc:description>

      <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited state compounds. Herein, we study the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state. Though a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, we define a set of guidelines to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components and subsequently test the validity of the guidelines on larger systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Proanthocyanins&#8208;capped biogenic TiO2 nanoparticles with enhanced penetration, antibacterial and ROS mediated inhibition of bacteria proliferation and biofilm formation: A comparative approach</title>
      <dc:description>The biofunctionalized TiO2 NPs, having a size range of 18.42 &#177; 1.3 nm were synthesized employing single step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) mediated proanthocyanins (PACs) polyphenols. The present study purposes to examine the effect of PACs rich GSE corona on (i) the stability and dispersity of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs, their (ii) anti&#8208;proliferative and anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy and (iii) propensity of internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in  P. aeruginosa  and&#160;  S. saprophyticus  strains. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques were used to validate NPs formation. The comparative FTIR spectral analysis demonstrated that PACs linked functional &#8208;OH groups likely played a central role in Ti  4+  reduction, nucleation, formation and stability of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs.&#160;The TEM&#160;and ICP&#8208;MS&#160;analyses confirmed there was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) enhanced intracellular uptake of GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs in tested uropathogens as compare to bare TiO  2  &#8208;NPs. Correspondingly, compared to bare NPs, GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs induced intracellular ROS formation that corresponded well with dose&#8208;dependent inhibitory patterns of cell proliferation and biofilm formation in both the tested strains. Overall, this study demonstrates that &#8208;OH rich PACs of GSE corona on biogenic TiO  2  &#8208;NPs maximized the functional stability, dispersity and propensity of penetration into planktonic cells and biofilm matrices; albeit, such unique merits warranted the GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs as a novel, functionally stable and efficient antibacterial nanoformulation to combat with UTIs menace in clinical settings</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B: Study of the Challenging &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylations</title>
      <dc:description>We report here a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable

antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosylation steps. It features the conclusive use of sulfoxide anomeric leaving&#8208;groups in combination with a remote 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;picoloyl group on the donors allowing highly b&#8208;selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD). The rhamnosylated C1&#8208;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8208;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semi&#8208;glycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2&#8208;naphthylmethyl (Nap) ether on a phenol and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin B.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report here a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable

antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosylation steps. It features the conclusive use of sulfoxide anomeric leaving&#8208;groups in combination with a remote 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;picoloyl group on the donors allowing highly b&#8208;selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD). The rhamnosylated C1&#8208;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8208;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semi&#8208;glycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2&#8208;naphthylmethyl (Nap) ether on a phenol and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tuning the regioselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes via lanthanum&#8208;mediated single C&#8208;F bond activation</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new fluorine containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. We herein present the highly regio and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes using a simple La/I  2  /DIBAL&#8208;Cl system via a selective C&#8208;F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provides homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF  2  &#8208;alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron&#8208;poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF  3  group in a diene has been observed, which according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis acidic lanthanum metal.</dc:description>

      <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: a Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>As a significant branch of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have obtained widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities of generating other photo&#8208;responsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photo&#8208;responsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands play a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most of CHPMs are built from photo&#8208;deformable or photo&#8208;responsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost, which greatly restrict their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to explore new families of CHPMs compared with the existing CHPMs. Herein, we report a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs via decorating metal nitrate with coplanar bipyridine moiety 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen). The resulting products exhibit apparent photo&#8208;coloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron&#8208;transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO  3  &#8208;  species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of coordination environment and central metal ions on photochromism have also been studied. Our work has demonstrated that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrate as &#960;&#8208;EDs under the collaboration of ET and coordination assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbone itself might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. Conceptually parallel process could allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we synthesized three types of 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns: a symmetric dimer with a C&#8211;C bond between the monomer units (  1  ) and two asymmetric dimers with a C&#8211;N bond between the monomer units (  2  and  3  ). The structure&#8208;property relationship of  1  &#8211;  3  were investigated. X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis revealed that the two DHDAT units are completely planar in the C&#8211;C linked dimer  1  whereas the monomer units are perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8211;N linked dimers  2  and  3  in the crystals. Reflecting their molecular structures, the electronic interaction between the two monomer units is larger in  1  and very little in  2  and  3  in the ground states. However, the emission behavior of  3  is remarkably different from those of other dimers and its monomer. The dimer  3  shows a clear positive solvatochromism in emission which is characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor type molecules in spite of its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Furthermore, the dimer  3  exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The reason for the different emission behaviors can be attributed to the asymmetric distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.</dc:description>

      <title>De Novo and Divergent Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Furans via Cascade Reactions of 2&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones with Nucleophiles</title>
      <dc:description>Divergent synthesis of a variety of 2&#945; and 5&#945; substituted furan derivatives from 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones were reported. By using proper substrate and acid catalyst, the reactions can selectively occur via cyclization/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition cascade or cyclization/Fridel&#8208;Craft type cascade reaction. A broad range of nucleophilic reagents (&gt; 10 types for 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition and &gt; 20 types for Fridel&#8208;Craft type cascade reaction) including alcohol, amide, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, indole, phenol, and many others, can successfully participate in the reaction, providing a universal strategy for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted furan derivatives. Deuteration experiment and DFT calculations were carried out to support the proposed reaction mechanisms. Antifungal activity experiments reveal that products with indole or 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin core substituted at 2&#945; position show moderate activities against Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctorzia solani respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning tetrazole photochemistry for protein ligation and molecular imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles&#160;featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents&#160;to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395 nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and theaza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with&#160;89Zr,&#160;64Cu and&#160;68Ga radionuclides.&#160;DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with&#160;89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable&#160;in vitro&#160;and retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing human SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.</dc:description>

      <title>The Simplest Model for Doped PEDOT (Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)): Single&#8208;crystalline EDOT Dimer Radical Cation Salts</title>
      <dc:description>Although doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) are extensively used in electronic devices, their molecular&#8208; weight distributions and inadequately defined structures have hindered the elucidation of their underlying conduction mechanism.

Single&#8208;crystal structural analyses revealed their one&#8208;dimensional (1D) columnar structures, in which the donors were uniformly stacked. Band calculations identified 1D metallic band structures with a strong intracolumnar orbital interaction (band width&#160; W&#160; ~ 1 eV), implying the origin of the high conductivity of doped PEDOT. Interestingly, the salts exhibited semiconducting behavior reminiscent of genuine Mott states as a result of electron&#8211;electron repulsion ( U ) dominant over&#160; W . This study realized basic models with tunable&#160; W&#160; and&#160; U&#160; to understand the conduction mechanism of doped PEDOT through structural modification in oligomers, including the conjugation length.</dc:description>

      <title>2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[b]arsole: structural modification and polymerization for tuning of photophysical properties</title>
      <dc:description>2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[  b  ]arsoles were synthesized from zirconacycles and diiodophenylarsine. The structural modification to the luminophore was attained through diarylacetylene precursors, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. The emission properties were controlled according to these modifications. The 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[  b  ]arsoles showed aggregation induced emission enhancement; the stronger emission was observed in the solid states than in solutions. In addition, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura polycondensation and olefin metathesis polymerization produced main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain polymers, respectively. The resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbohydrate Derived Metal Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterial for advanced targeted delivery applications. Implementation of external stimuli controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. In this paper, we present the synthesis of a carbohydrate derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on Zn2+ presence: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is to our knowledge the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a single liposome study, we found that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. Upon addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.</dc:description>
