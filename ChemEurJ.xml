         <title>The Role of the Transient Atropisomerism and Chirality of Flurbiprofen Unveiled by Laser&#8208;Ablation Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of atropisomerism and chirality in flurbiprofen is shown to be relevant concerning its pharmacological activity. The two most stable conformers of a total of eight theoretically predicted for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; flurbiprofen enantiomers have been isolated in the cooling conditions of a supersonic jet and structurally characterized by laser ablation Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The detected conformers, whose structure is mainly defined by three dihedral angles, only differ in the sign of the phenyl torsion angle giving rise to Sa and Ra atropisomers. A comparison with the structures available for the R&#8208; and S&#8208; enantiomers complexed to COX isoforms reveals that the enzymes select only the Sa atropisomers, resulting in a diastereoisomer&#8208;specific recognition. The most stable gas phase conformer is exclusively selected when using the S&#8208; enantiomer while the second is recognized only for the R&#8208; enantiomer. These experimental results highlight the importance of atropisomerism in drug design.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Binding and Dynamic Transporting&#8208;Based Design of Specific Ring&#8208;Chain&#8208;Ring Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor: From Galantamine to Natural Product</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key target for the current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and galantamine is a clinical anticholinesterase drug with transiently acting characteristic and good selectivity for AChE.&#160;The present theoretical&#8208;experimental work improves the drug's residence time without reducing inhibition effect, thus provides crucial breakthrough for modifying the inhibitor of AChE with better&#8208;kinetic behavior. The static binding and dynamic delivery properties acquired from atomic view reveal that the galantamine simply occupies catalytic anionic site, and its release from AChE needs only ~ 8.6 kcal/mol.&#160;Both of them may cause the short residence time of galantamine.&#160;The hotspots and most favorable transport mechanism are identified, and the hydrogen bond&#160;and aromatic stacking interactions are observed to play crucial roles for galantamine binding and release in AChE. The typical peripheral anionic site arisen at the delivery process would provide another key occupation to enhance the anti&#8208;release ability for inhibitors.&#160;The compound with &#8220;specific&#8208;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework&#160;with&#160;detail beneficial modify scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of inhibitor in AChE. The thermodynamic and dynamic properties of galantamine derivatives&#160;are also studied. Based on dictamnine, a natural alkaloid, two novel eligible derivatives are designed, synthesized&#160;and evaluated, which verifies our prediction. Multiple computational approaches and experiment combination probably provide a train of thought from static and dynamic view to modify or design appropriate inhibitor on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.</dc:description>

         <title>New Fields, New Opportunities and New Challenges: Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), and narrowband emission, by merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced TADF characteristic into one molecule. This approach is propitious to the direct realization of 3D and wide color gamut display applications in the future.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials that concurrently exhibit high efficiency and narrowband emission are extremely promising applications in 3D and wide color gamut display. By merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic into one molecule, a new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with CPL activity, TADF and narrowband emission. High&#8208;performance red, green and blue CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters have been developed following this strategy. Herein, the present status and progress of CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is summarized. Finally, for this rapidly growing new research field, the future opportunities are forecasted and the present challenges are discussed.

         <title>Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the interest in polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds has steadily increased as the versatility of these in material science are explored, for example in fluorescent probes and pyroelectronics. In this concept, recent advances in organocatalysed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a synthetic tool to access novel polycyclic (hetero)aromatic compounds are demonstrated.







Abstract
Cycloadditions are an important class of reactions in materials science for the construction of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. Recently, cycloadditions have been expanded beyond the &#8220;classical&#8221; group of cycloadditions involving six &#960;&#8208;electrons, and it is now possible to control cycloadditions for an extended number of &#960;&#8208;electrons by applying organocatalysis. This novel field of cycloadditions&#8211;termed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions&#8211;allows new synthetic methodologies to construct polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heteroaromatic compounds in two or three dimensions. This concept presents higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a method for accessing two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional azulenes and cyclazines, as well as three dimensional indenes, as polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds.

         <title>Isomerically Pure Oxindole&#8208;Terminated Quinoids for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Enabled by the Chlorination of Quinoidal Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of incorporating Cl atoms in the quinoidal core has been developed to control the configuration of quinoidal compounds. Unlike the reported configurational locking approaches, this strategy can simultaneously maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. As a result, isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobility can be obtained.







Abstract
Quinoidal compounds have great potential utility as high&#8208;performance organic semiconducting materials because of their rigid planar structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, the existence of E and Z isomers adversely affects the charge&#8208;transport properties of quinoidal compounds. In this study, three isomerically pure oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids were developed by introducing chlorine atoms in the quinoidal core. The synthesized quinoids were confirmed to have a Z,Z configuration by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Importantly, the strategy of chlorination allowed to maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. Consequently, all three quinoidal compounds showed n&#8208;type transport characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors, with electron mobilities up to 0.35&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported to date for oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids. Our study can provide new guidelines for the design of isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobilities.

         <title>Plenates: Anion&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of the Pyrrole Cage Encapsulating Silver(I) Clusters</title>

Cages full of silver: The self&#8208;assembly of diformylpyrrole, tren amine, and silver(I) halides yielded cascade complexes incorporating the [Ag2F]+ unit or the Ag2Cl2 ion pair. Exploitation of silver(I) triflate, incorporating a bulky anion, resulted in the formation of plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The latter transformed into cascade cryptates upon reaction with tetrabutylammonium halides.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded, depending on the size and basicity of the anion, new cascade complexes or plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The nature of the product was counterion&#8208;dependent, and its formation was either driven by cascade anion binding or by argentophilic interactions stabilizing the cluster within the cavity. The reaction of plenates with tetrabutylammonium halides resulted in the protonation&#8208;coupled replacement of the Ag33+ with anion(s), yielding cascade cryptates.

With RGD peptidomimetics straight to the target: Improving the conjugation strategy of small molecular integrin ligands increases cancer targeting and cytotoxicity of small molecule drug conjugates addressing integrin &#945;V&#946;3 expressing melanoma cells.







Abstract
Small molecule&#8208;drug conjugates (SMDCs) mimicking the RGD sequence (&#8208;Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;) with a non&#8208;peptide moiety require a pharmacophore&#8208;independent attachment site. A library of 36 sulfonamide&#8208;modified RGD mimetics with nM to pM affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 was synthesized and analysed via DAD mapping. The best structure of the conjugable RGD mimetic was used and a linker was attached to an aromatic ring by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling. The product retained high affinity and selectivity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3. The conjugable RGD mimetic was then attached to an enzymatically cleavable GKGEVA linker equipped with a self&#8208;immolative PABC and the antimitotic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The resulting SMDC preferred binding to integrin &#945;V&#946;3 over &#945;5&#946;1 in a ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4519 (ELISA) and showed selectivity for &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;positive WM115 cells over &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;negative M21&#8208;L cells in the in&#8197;vitro cell adhesion assay as well as in cell viability assays with a targeting index of 134 (M21&#8208;L/WM115).

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Triggered Coordination&#8208;Bond Breakage in Dysprosium&#8208;Organic Framework and its Impact on Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray (&#955;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation induces the breakage of Dy&#8722;OH2 coordination bond in a 3D framework Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X). The phase transition is accompanied with significant change in the magnetic properties due to the change in the coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.







Abstract
Photosensitive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (Ln&#8722;SMM) are very attractive for their potential applications in information storage, switching, and sensors. However, the light&#8208;driven structural transformation in Ln&#8722;SMMs hardly changes the coordination number of the lanthanide ion. Herein, for the first time it is reported that X&#8208;ray (&#955;=0.71073&#8197;&#197;) irradiation can break the coordination bond of Dy&#8722;OH2 in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), in which the {Dy2(OPO)2} dimers are cross&#8208;linked by dianthracene&#8208;phosphonate ligands. The structural transformation proceeds in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion, forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X). The phase transition is accompanied by a significant change in magnetic properties due to the alteration in coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self&#8208;Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled enzyme mimic. Calix[4]arenes, provided with long alkyl chains and guanidine units, perform spontaneous aggregation driven by hydrophobic effect. A pronounced superiority of the phosphodiesterase activity of the assembled structures compared with the monomers indicates intermolecular cooperation of the active units through a dynamic preorganization.







Abstract
The calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic effect, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering. The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favors phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.

     alt="Intra- and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self-Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self-assembled enzyme mimic&lt;/b&gt;. Calix[4]arenes, provided with long alkyl chains and guanidine units, perform spontaneous aggregation driven by hydrophobic effect. A pronounced superiority of the phosphodiesterase activity of the assembled structures compared with the monomers indicates intermolecular cooperation of the active units through a dynamic preorganization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic effect, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering. The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favors phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Electrochemical Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Quinoline N&#8208;oxides by Cathodic Reduction of Nitro Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple electrochemical reductive protocol was established for the direct formation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides with mild reaction conditions, in an undivided set&#8208;up, with a broad scope. The technical significance of this method could be demonstrated on a multigram scale.







Abstract
The use of electric current in synthetic organic chemistry offers a sustainable tool for the selective reductive synthesis of quinoline N&#8208;oxides starting from easily accessible nitro compounds. The reported method employs mild and reagent&#8208;free conditions, a simple undivided cell, and constant current electrolysis set&#8208;up which provides conversion with a high atom economy. The synthesis of 30 differently substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides was successfully performed in up to 90&#8201;% yield. Using CV studies, the mechanism of the selective formation of the quinoline N&#8208;oxides was elucidated. The technical relevance of the described reaction could be shown in a 50&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up reaction.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Responsive Molecular Receptor to Modulate Atropisomerism and Cation Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>

Switchable anthranyl receptors controlled by 1O2 show a different preorganization of the binding sites induced by two combined effects: the structural modification and the on/off mode for the host atropisomerism.







Abstract
In switchable molecular recognition, 1O2 stimulus responsive receptors offer a unique structural change that is rarely exploited. The employed [4+2] reaction between 1O2 and anthracene derivatives is quantitative, reversible and easily implemented. To evaluate the full potential of this new stimulus, a non&#8208;macrocyclic anthracene&#8208;based host was designed for the modular binding of cations. The structural investigation showed that 1O2 controlled the atropisomerism in an on/off fashion within the pair of hosts. The binding studies revealed higher association constants for the endoperoxide receptor compared to the parent anthracene, due to a more favoured preorganization of the recognition site. The fatigue of the 1O2 switchable hosts and their complexes was monitored over five cycles of cycloaddition/cycloreversion.

         <title>Crystal Plane&#8208;Related Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity of Single Hexagonal Co3O4 Spinel Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
SECCM measurements together with SEM and AFM are used to determine the intrinsic activity of two different crystallographic planes available at a single hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface exposing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness&#8208;dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100&#8197;s&#8722;1 at a potential of 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and a particle thickness of 100&#8197;nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270&#177;68&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. The higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free&#8208;diffusing Os complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles, which explains the thickness&#8208;dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.

         <title>Construction of TiO2/SrTiO3 Heterojunction Derived from Monolayer Ti3C2 MXene for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2 MXene as the template and reactant. It demonstrates that the optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction is dependent on the hydrothermal reaction time respectively.







Abstract
Construction of heterojunction at the atomic scale to ensure efficient charge separation for improvement of photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in&#8197;situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2 MXene as the template and reactant. It is found that the sample with the hydrothermal reaction time of 60&#8197;min exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate with the sacrificial reagent, due to the efficient charge separation of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction as Ti3C2 derivative. In addition, the sample shows the best overall water splitting performance at a hydrothermal reaction time of 120&#8197;min, where TiO2 is nearly converted to SrTiO3, due to the fast kinetic process and low structural defects of SrTiO3. This work not only provides a simple strategy for the fabrication of heterojunction photocatalysts but also demonstrates the difference in optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Bioreducible Polymers for mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring opening polymerization of active ester&#8208;containing lipoic acid monomers generated poly(active ester)disulfide polymers. Mild and controlled aminolysis of poly(active ester)disulfides yields multifunctional polymers bearing cationic, ionizable, and hydrophobic derivatives. Combining multifunctional polymers with mRNA yields distinct nanoparticles that are capable delivering EGFP and OVA mRNA to dendritic cells in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Bioreducible polymeric mRNA carriers are an emerging family of vectors for gene delivery and vaccine development. A few bioreducible systems have been generated through aqueous&#8208;phase ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lipoic acid derivatives, however this methodology limits hydrophobic group incorporation and functionality into resulting polymers. Herein, a poly(active ester)disulfide polymer is synthesized that can undergo facile aminolysis with amine&#8208;containing substrates under stoichiometric control and mild reaction conditions to yield a library of multifunctional polydisulfide polymers. Functionalized polydisulfide polymer species form stable mRNA&#8208;polymer nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of mRNAs in&#8197;vitro. Alkyl&#8208;functionalized polydisulfide&#8208;RNA nanoparticles demonstrate rapid cellular uptake and excellent biodegradability when delivering EGFP and OVA mRNAs to cells in&#8197;vitro. This streamlined polydisulfide synthesis provides a new facile methodology for accessing multifunctional bioreducible polymers as biomaterials for RNA delivery and other applications.

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones: A Solvent Controlled Divergent Access of gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Containing Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in a divergent fashion. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to various styrene derivatives benefitted with the formation of two essential classes of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing tetrahydrofuran&#8208;ring and linear ketones in a divergent fashion. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations strongly support the proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
Selective defluorinative functionalization of trifluoromethyl ketones is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the exhaustive mode of the process. To meet the demands for the installation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene unit for the construction of the molecular architectures of well&#8208;known pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, a distinct pathway is thereby highly desirable. Here, a protocol is introduced that allows the divergent synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene group containing tetrahydrofuran derivatives and linear ketones via single C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in the presence of suitable olefins as trapping partner. The choice of appropriate solvent and catalyst plays a significant role in controlling the divergent behavior of this protocol. Highly reducing photo&#8208;excited catalysts are found to be responsible for the generation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketone (DFMK) radicals as the key intermediate via a SET process. This protocol also results in a high diastereoselectivity towards the formation of partially fluorinated cyclic ketal derivatives with simultaneous construction of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;O bonds. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations are performed to address the origin of diastereoselectivity as well as the divergence of this protocol.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Stable Arylfluorene&#8208;Based Radical&#8208;Type Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorene&#8208;based radical&#8208;type mechanophores with various electron densities have been investigated. The thermal stability and tolerance for peroxidation of the sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon radicals increased with decreasing electron density of the fluorene moiety. DFT calculations revealed that the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species are of crucial importance for the thermal stability and susceptibility toward peroxidation. A triazylfluorene&#8208;based radical&#8208;type mechanophore showed high stability toward oxidation and mechanochromic behavior when incorporated in polymer chains.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;type mechanophores (RMs) can undergo homolytic cleavage of their central C&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to mechanical forces, which affords radical species. Understanding the characteristics of these radical species allows bespoke mechanoresponsive materials to be designed and developed. The thermal stability of the central C&#8722;C bonds and the oxygen tolerance of the generated radical species are crucial characteristics that determine the functions and applicability of such RM&#8208;containing mechanoresponsive materials. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of two series of arylfluorene&#8208;based RM derivatives, that is, 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BPyF) and 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;triazyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BTAF). BPyF and BTAF derivatives were synthesized without generating any peroxides initially, albeit that BPyF slowly converted to the corresponding peroxide in solution. DFT calculations revealed the importance of the thermodynamic stability and the values of the &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species for their thermal stability and oxygen tolerance. Furthermore, the mechanochromism of BTAF was demonstrated by ball&#8208;milling a BTAF&#8208;centered polymer, which was synthesized by atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).

Ge&#8208;fused azobenzene compounds: Hypervalent compounds with a germanium(Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffold exhibiting NIR emission despite the compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The synergistic effect between a hypervalent bond and the extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation is a novel and effective strategy for obtaining NIR emissive materials.







Abstract
A novel molecular design for showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is still required for satisfying growing demands for NIR&#8208;light technology. In this research, hypervalent compounds with germanium (Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffolds were discovered that can exhibit NIR emission (&#955;PL=690&#8764;721&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=0.03&#8764;0.04) despite compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The unique optical properties are derived from the trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the hypervalent compounds constructed by combination of Ge and azobenzene&#8208;based tridentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical calculation results disclosed that the germanium&#8208;nitrogen (Ge&#8722;N) coordination at the equatorial position strongly reduces the energy level of the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3&#8201;c&#8211;4&#8201;e) bond in the apical position effectively rises the energy level of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). It is emphasized that large narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is achieved just by forming the hypervalent bond. In addition, the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap property can be enhanced by extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The obtained &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer shows efficient NIR emission both in solution (&#955;PL=770&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.10) and film (&#955;PL=807&#8197;nm and &#934;PL=0.04). These results suggest that collaboration of a hypervalent bond and a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a novel and effective strategy for tuning electronic properties even in the NIR region.

         <title>Visible Light Thiyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Desilylation of Arylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available and cheap disulfides proved to be excellent thiyl&#8208;radical sources for the mild desilylation of arylsilanes under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method relying in a radical chain mechanism shows a broad applicability and functional group tolerance, allowing for the effective reaction of simple arylsilanes, as well as complex structures and therapeutic derivatives.







Abstract
A straightforward, visible&#8208;light triggered desilylation of arylsilanes by thiyl radicals is presented. Silyl groups are often used to block a reactive position in multi&#8208;step organic synthesis, for which a mild cleavage at a late&#8208;stage will provide new possibilities and disconnection routes by CAr&#8722;Si cleavage/deprotection. In this work, commercially available and cheap disulfides are employed for the first time in this type of C(sp2)&#8208;Si bond cleavage reactions. Thus, upon irradiation with visible&#8208;light, homolytic cleavage of the disulfide give rise to the corresponding thiyl radical that allows for a radical chain mechanism. This methodology represents a mild, fast and simple approach suitable for a broad variety of simply substituted arylsilanes. Moreover, the procedure could be easily extended to natural products and therapeutic derivatives, showing its robustness and synthetic application potential.

         <title>The Effect of Hydrogenation on the Contest between Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity in Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed using DFT show that a key feature of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), its antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered cyclic conjugated subsystem with 16 &#960; electrons that is formally preserved in all hydrogenated norcorroles, unexpectedly becomes less and less antiaromatic in the series H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc, which is predicted to end in the completely nonaromatic H8NiNc.







Abstract
Magnetic shielding studies demonstrate that successive hydrogenation of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), a stable molecule combining aromatic and antiaromatic features, first weakens and then eliminates the central antiaromatic region, even though the NiNc antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered conjugated cycle with 16 &#960; electrons, is formally preserved throughout the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series. The differences between aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic isotropic shielding distributions and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) values in these hydrogenated porphyrin analogues are highlighted by comparing the results for the members of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series to those for the aromatic NiII porphyrin complex. The results strongly support the unexpected and counterintuitive conclusion that H8NiNc will be nonaromatic, without even a trace of antiaromaticity. Based on these findings, H8NiNc is predicted to be the most stable member of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series.

         <title>Disentangling the Effect of Pressure and Mixing on a Mechanochemical Bromination Reaction by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical bromination of a heterocyclic sulfoximine is studied by ex&#8208; and in&#8197;situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. A selective and fast reaction is observed in a mixer mill, which can alternatively be induced either using the centrifugal pressure of magic&#8208;angle spinning or by solely magnetic stirring the solid entities.







Abstract
Mechanical forces, including compressive stresses, have a significant impact on chemical reactions. Besides the preparative opportunities, mechanochemical conditions benefit from the absence of any organic solvent, the possibility of a significant synthetic acceleration and unique reaction pathways. Together with an accurate characterization of ball&#8208;milling products, the development of a deeper mechanistic understanding of the occurring transformations at a molecular level is critical for fully grasping the potential of organic mechanosynthesis. We herein studied a bromination of a cyclic sulfoximine in a mixer mill and used solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization of the reaction products. Magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) was applied for elucidating the product mixtures taken from the milling jar without introducing any further post&#8208;processing on the sample. Ex situ 13C&#8208;detected NMR spectra of ball&#8208;milling products showed the formation of a crystalline solid phase with the regioselective bromination of the S&#8208;aryl group of the heterocycle in position 4. Completion is reached in less than 30&#8197;minutes as deduced from the NMR spectra. The bromination can also be achieved by magnetic stirring, but then, a longer reaction time is required. Mixing the solid educts in the NMR rotor allows to get in&#8197;situ insights into the reaction and enables the detection of a reaction intermediate. The pressure alone induced in the rotor by MAS is not sufficient to lead to full conversion and the reaction occurs on slower time scales than in the ball mill, which is crucial for analysing mixtures taken from the milling jar by solid&#8208;state NMR. Our data suggest that on top of centrifugal forces, an efficient mixing of the starting materials is required for reaching a complete reaction.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage in Lignin via Co Nanoparticles Embedded in 3DNG as Catalyst

Cobalt nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene exhibited high catalytic activity for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin under moderate condition without any additive.







Abstract
The cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight aromatics. Herein, Co nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X) were prepared through an immersion&#8208;pyrolysis procedure, in which X denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The detailed characterization of Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X shows that the Co nanoparticles are coated with a few layers of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) sheets that are further embedded in 3DNG matrix. The catalytic activities of the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X for the oxidative cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin model compounds with O2 as oxidant are explored. It is demonstrated that catalytic activities of as&#8208;prepared Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X can be tuned by varying the pyrolysis condition, and the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 shows the highest catalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched Co&#8208;Nx species, the strong surface basicity, the high specific surface and the mesoporous motif of 3DNG network. More pronouncedly, the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 can also effectively catalyze the oxidative cleavage of organosolv lignin, generating certain monomeric aromatics. Additionally, the intrinsic magnetic property of Co nanoparticles makes the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X be easily recovered from the reaction mixture, and the as&#8208;coated thin NG layer can protect Co nanoparticle from oxidation condition, which putting together afford the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X with good reusability and stability.

The unprecedent intermolecular n&#8594;&#960;* interactions with a designer multicarbonyl&#8208;containing macrocycle were revealed. The integrated cooperative C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions can drive self&#8208;assembly formation of functional nanotubes as demonstrated allowing for single&#8208;crystal chromatography separation of moving dyes.

The integrated cooperative C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions can drive self-assembly formation of functional nanotubes as demonstrated allowing for single-crystal chromatography separation of moving dyes.

         <title>Revisiting the Reaction of IPr with Tritylium: An Alternative Mechanistic Pathway
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>

Despite the high ionization energy of imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with oxidants have been postulated to occur via a transient NHC radical cation intermediate. Herein, we propose the alternative mechanism to explain the outcome of the tritylium reaction with IPr without the intermediacy of unstable [IPr]&#8901;+.







Abstract
Despite a recent proposal on the mechanism of a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process between tritylium and 2,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) based on evidence of transient IPr radical cation intermediate ([IPr]&#8901;+) formation, such oxidation is still contentious because of the high oxidation potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Our experimental analysis indicates that the appearance of deep purple color, previously considered to be from transient [IPr]&#8901;+, originates from a zwitterionic intermediate (3&#8201;a), not a radical cation. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism for the reaction involving tritylium and IPr. This mechanism is noteworthy for explaining how [NHC&#8722;H]+ can be generated without the formation of transient [NHC]&#8901;+, which has been frequently proposed as an intermediate for the reaction between NHC and oxidants. These results also show that a transient strong single&#8208;electron donor (3&#8201;a) could be generated by the alternative mechanism for oxidants using NHCs, which is a more feasible explanation for the reactivity of NHCs with oxidants.

         <title>Structures and Supramolecular Properties of Inclusion Complexes of Anthracene&#8208;Triptycene Nanocages with Fullerene Guests and Their Dynamic Motion as Molecular Gyroscopes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of anthracene&#8208;triptycene nanocages having various peripheral substituents formed inclusion complexes with fullerene guests via multipoint CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis provided the first direct structural evidence of the inclusion complex formation and the unique dynamic behavior of the included C60 molecule in the cage cavity, and showed that the complex behaved as a supramolecular gyroscope.







Abstract
Three derivatives of macrocyclic cage compounds consisting of diarylanthracene and triptycene units were synthesized. These nanocages formed host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and other fullerene guests as confirmed by 1H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The association constant of the mesityl and 2,4,6&#8208;tributoxyphenyl derivatives with C60 was determined to be 2.2 &#215; 104&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which was larger than that of the pentafluorophenyl derivative. Direct experimental evidence of the complexation was obtained by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis: the guest C60 molecule was included in the cavity via multipoint CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Dynamic disorders of the included C60 molecule in variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray analysis indicated uniaxial motion, such as gyroscopic motion. The unique dynamic behavior of the spherical C60 rotor anchored by the cage stator via CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystal, as well as substituent effects on the association properties, are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

Although the discovery of insulin has radically improved the treatment and prognosis of diabetes, bringing it from an incurable disease to a manageable chronic disease, it faces problems of the short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. By conjugation with zwitterionic polymer, stabilily and pharmacokinetics of insulin are both improved greatly. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.







Abstract
Insulin, a main medication to control glycemia of type&#8197;1 and advanced type&#8197;2 diabetes, faces problems of a short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. Here, we have synthesized a new insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate (INS&#8208;PMPC) through grafting&#8208;from strategy by controlled radical polymerization. Apart from showing excellent stability upon mechanical agitation, the resulting INS&#8208;PMPC conjugate provided over 20&#8197;h of glycemic control due to improved pharmacokinetics in diabetic mice with one single subcutaneous injection. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.

A three&#8208;dimensional holey graphene modified Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/C cathode has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable solid&#8208;state ball milling and calcination processes with holey graphene (HG) as the conductive carrier and sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as the precursors. The introduction of HG has greatly improved the electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion kinetics of the electrode.







Abstract
Polyanion&#8208;type Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) modified NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity, and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 100&#8197;C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, in situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, the HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.

The introduction of HG has greatly improved the electronic conductivity and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics of the electrode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyanion-type Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) modified NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity, and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even at an ultrahigh rate of 100&#8197;C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, in situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, the HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ZnTe/rGO Composite as the Fully Zinced Conversion&#8208;Type Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion between ZnTe and Te leads to an ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau, and avoids &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polytellurides in aqueous electrolyte. Besides, fully zinced ZnTe in graphene wrapping shrinkage when charged to Te, providing spare space to alleviate volume expansion of Te during discharge. As a result, ZnTe/rGO composite exhibits high capacity, stable output voltage and good cycle stability.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) can provide flat plateau slop and stable output potential, compared to general intercalation&#8208;type cathodes. The high volumetric capacity and stable output potential of Te make it a promising cathode for ZIBs, but sluggish kinetics and large volume change hinder its further application. To address these issues, we revisit fully zinced ZnTe and construct ZnTe/rGO composites as the new conversion&#8208;type cathode. The electrode undergoes a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion reaction and shows a stable output potential with ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau slop of 0.09&#8197;V (Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1)&#8722;1. When ZnTe is de&#8208;zinced and transformed to Te during charge process, it has a volume shrinkage which generates empty space in graphene matrix for latter volume expansion of Te. The graphene matrix also improves conductivity and reaction kinetics of the cathode. Due to the combination of pre&#8208;zincation of ZnTe, graphene matrix and the elimination of &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; process, ZnTe/rGO electrode exhibits a high and stable capacity of 186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycling, with almost no decay after initial 10 cycles.

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF Based Ratiometric Luminescent Sensor for the Detection of Potential COVID&#8208;19 Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence detection is a fast and convenient method to quantify and control the drug amount in body fluids. Here, we present a new mixed lanthanide&#8208;based MOF that can selectively distinguish and monitor the amount of favipiravir among other potential COVID&#8208;19 drugs.







Abstract
Countless people have been affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic on a global scale. Favipiravir, has shown potential as an effective drug for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, attracting scientists&#8217; attention. However, overuse of Favipiravir easily leads to serious side effects, requiring real&#8208;time monitoring in body fluids. Given this, a new lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was prepared under solvothermal conditions from either Eu (Eu&#8208;MOF or (1)) or Tb (Tb&#8208;MOF or (2)) using the highly delocalized imidazoledicarboxylic acid linker H2L (H2L=5&#8208;(4&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) phenyl) isophthalic acid) and could be successfully applied to selective optical detection of Favipiravir. In this MOF framework, the organic linker H2L provides a high excitation energy transfer efficiency that can sensitize luminescence in lanthanides. In addition, through deliberate tuning of Eu/Tb molar ratio and reaction concentration in the lanthanide framework, ratiometric recyclable luminescent EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;MOF nanoparticles with open metal sites have been constructed, which present a high detection sensitivity (Ksv=1&#215;107 [M&#8722;1], detection limit is 4.63&#8197;nM) for Favipiravir. The detection mechanism is discussed with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that sheds light over the selective sensing of Favipiravir over other related COVID&#8208;19 drug candidates. Finally, to explore the practical application of Favipiravir sensing, MOF based thin films have been used for visual detection of Favipiravir and recycled 5 times.

A human dive into the ocean of &#945;&#8208;SOMO levels: Exhaled oxygen bubbles cause peroxidation of radical&#8208;type mechanophores (RMs), which generate shallow &#945;&#8208;SOMO level radical species; however, RMs that generate deep &#945;&#8208;SOMO level radical species did not afford peroxide compounds. One of the C&#8722;C RMs was applied to the design of a mechanoresponsive polymer. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Otsuka, K. Mikami, and co&#8208;workers.

The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded a series of new cascade complexes or plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The tripyrrolic cage is represented by a wooden chest hiding the treasure, which in the case of plenates, contains a pile of shiny silver atoms. In contrast, for cascade complexes, two precious metals lie next to anions shown as colorful gems. Obviously, such treasure cannot remain unprotected&#8230; More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Szyszko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203850).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pathway to access polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds from simple starting materials has been investigated. The starting materials are funneled in an organocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition that generates three&#8208;dimensional polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds. The compounds are then easily flattened to their two&#8208;dimensional analogues by oxidation. More information can be found in the Concept by K.&#8197;A. J&#248;rgensen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204008).

         <dc:description>
In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NaxMnO2 (NMO) are reviewed. High&#8208;capacity NMOs and strategies to improve capacity are introduced and discussed in detail. The future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.







Abstract
Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieving considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type, and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.

         <title>Co&#8208;based Catalysts for Selective H2O2 Electroproduction via 2&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 12, February 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among them, Co&#8722;based catalysts have been widely studied for the selective production of H2O2 by 2&#8208;electron ORR. Here, this review focuses on the mechanism of 2&#8208;electron ORR from the perspective of kinetics and thermodynamics and summarizes the research progress of Co&#8722;based catalysts including Co molecular catalysts, Co nanoparticles, Co compounds, and Co single atom catalysts. It was demonstrated that Co&#8722;based catalysts had exhibited great selectivity towards 2&#8208;electron ORR. Finally, we also discuss the challenges faced by various types of catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8722;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth&#8208;abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8722;based electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2&#8208;electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.

         <title>PIDA&#8208;mediated Oxidative Decarboxylation of Oxamic Acids. The Role of Radical Acidity Enhancement.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient thermal protocol to decarboxylate oxamic acids is found to have contrasting behaviour with its photochemical alternative. The enhanced radical acidity of a carbamoyl intermediate is shown to be key in the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative decarboxylation of oxamic acids in the presence of alcohols is shown to afford the corresponding urethanes under thermal conditions. Computational and experimental mechanistic exploration allows to rationalize the different reactivity of PIDA as compared to related cyclic BI&#8208;OAc and highlights the importance of the enhanced acidity of the proton in the carbamoyl radical intermediate.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fullerene Electron Acceptors Based on Hybridisation of Corannulene and Thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;Dioxide Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors: A combination of the bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene and thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxides motifs is shown to be a strong molecular design in the preparation of non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors.







Abstract
Herein we show that hybridisation of buckybowl corannulene and thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide motifs is a general approach for the preparation of high electron affinity molecular materials. The devised synthesis is modular and relies on thienannulation of corannnulene&#8208;based phenylacetylene scaffolds. The final compounds are highly soluble in common organic solvents. These compounds also exhibit interesting optical properties such as absorption and emission in the blue/green regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Importantly, a bis&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide derivative exhibits three reversible reductions similar in their strength to the prevalent fullerene&#8208;based electron acceptor phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).

         <title>Photochemistry Driven by Excited&#8208;State Aromaticity Gain or Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic and antiaromatic molecules are light&#8208;switched yin&#8208;yang entities flipping aromaticity into antiaromaticity, and vice versa, upon excitation to the lowest &#960;&#960;* state. This key feature has an impact on the photoreactivity and photostability of molecules in a variety of areas, and can serve as a compass for excursions in electronically excited states.







Abstract
Gain of aromaticity or relief of antiaromaticity along a reaction path are important factors to consider in mechanism studies. Analysis of such changes along potential energy surfaces has historically focused on reactions in the electronic ground state (S0), but can also be used for excited states. In the lowest &#960;&#960;* states, the electron counts for aromaticity and antiaromaticity follow Baird's rule where 4n &#960;&#8208;electrons indicate aromaticity and 4n+2 &#960;&#8208;electrons antiaromaticity. Yet, there are also cases where H&#252;ckel's rule plays a role in the excited state. The electron count reversals of Baird's rule compared to H&#252;ckel's rule explain many altered physicochemical properties upon excitation of (hetero)annulene derivatives. Here we illustrate how the gain of excited&#8208;state aromaticity (ESA) and relief of excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity (ESAA) have an impact on photoreactivity and photostability. Emphasis is placed on recent findings supported by the results of quantum chemical calculations, and photoreactions in a wide variety of areas are covered.

         <title>Stirring&#8208;Free Scalable Electrosynthesis Enabled by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of alternating current enables the concept of a stirring&#8208;free batch reactor, where the periodic switch of electrode polarity provides uniform electrolysis throughout the reactor volume. The AC&#8208;derived design implies a straightforward approach for scaling up electrosynthesis from parallel screening experiments to large&#8208;scale preparative electrolysis.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is receiving increased interest as a versatile tool for mild and selective electrochemical transformations. This work demonstrates that AC can enable the concept of a stirring&#8208;free electrochemical reactor where the periodic switch of electrode polarity, inherent to AC, provides uniform electrolysis across the whole volume of the reactor. Such design implies a straightforward approach for scaling up electrosynthesis. This was demonstrated on the range of electrochemical transformations performed in three different RVC&#8208;packed reactors on up to a 50&#8208;mmol scale. Redox&#8208;neutral, oxidative, and reductive processes were successfully implemented using the suggested design and the applicable frequency ranges were further investigated for different types of reactions. The advantages of the AC&#8208;enabled design &#8211; such as the absence of stirring and a maximized surface area of the electrodes &#8211; provide the possibility for its universal application both for small&#8208;scale screening experimentation and large&#8208;scale preparative electrosynthesis without significant optimization needed in between.

         <title>Biomimetic Tweezers for N&#8208;Glycans: Selective Recognition of the Core GlcNAc2 Disaccharide of the Sialylglycopeptide SGP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry meets glycans: Taking advantage of a tweezers&#8208;shaped structure, a biomimetic receptor selectively recognizes the GlcNAc2 disaccharide core of a complex N&#8208;glycan with a remarkable affinity of 170&#8197;&#956;M. Because of the simple structure of the receptor and the ubiquity of the highly conserved GlcNAc2 disaccharide core in N&#8208;glycans, the receptor can be a versatile supramolecular tool for glycosciences.







Abstract
In recent years, glycomics have shown how pervasive the role of carbohydrates in biological systems is and how chemical tools are essential to investigate glycan function and modulate carbohydrate&#8208;mediated processes. Biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates can carry out this task but, although significant affinities and selectivities toward simple saccharides have been achieved, targeting complex glycoconjugates remains a goal yet unattained. In this work we report the unprecedented recognition of a complex biantennary sialylglycopeptide (SGP) by a tweezers&#8208;shaped biomimetic receptor, which selectively binds to the core GlcNAc2 disaccharide of the N&#8208;glycan with an affinity of 170&#8197;&#956;M. Because of the simple structure and the remarkable binding ability, this biomimetic receptor can represent a versatile tool for glycoscience, opening the way to useful applications.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;Based Molecular Wizard Hats Bearing Three ortho&#8208;Benzoquinone Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The warped polyaromatic compounds 12 and 16 were synthesized via complementarily functionalized TBTQ&#8208;based dodecaethers. Congener 12, representing an 18&#960;&#8208;electron push&#8208;pull system, exhibits a much more bathochromic absorption in the visible than 16, which bears three cross&#8208;conjugated push&#8208;pull &#960;&#8208;systems. Structural features obtained by X&#8208;ray diffraction agree with this striking difference.







Abstract
Two &#960;&#8208;extended bay&#8208;bridged tribenzotriquinacenes (&#8220;TBTQ wizard hats&#8221;) 12 and 16 bearing three mutually conjugated, alternating veratrole&#8208;type and ortho&#8208;benzoquinone units were synthesized. The electronic properties of these complementarily arranged, nonplanar push&#8208;pull systems are affected by the fusion with the rigid, C3&#8208;symmetric TBTQ core to a different extent, as revealed by X&#8208;ray structural analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry. The combination of three quinone units within the original TBTQ core and three veratrole&#8208;type bay bridging units in 12 gives rise to a more efficiently &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore, as reflected by the shallower shape of wizard hat and its absorption in the visible up to 750&#8197;nm in comparison to 16. Congener 12 contains an aromatic 18&#8208;&#960; electron system in contrast to the cross&#8208;conjugated analog 16. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of the precursor dodecaether 15 revealed the formation of a cage&#8208;like supramolecular dimer, in which the peripheral dioxane&#8208;type ether groups interlace by twelve noncovalent C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Dithiocarbazates as Anticancer Agents: Synthesis, Solution Behavior, and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Apoptotic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, characterization, ruthenium&#8208;assisted oxime to imine transformation, solution/aqueous phase stability, hydrophobicity, DNA interaction, and cytotoxicity studies (cellular localization, and apoptosis) of three new ruthenium(II)&#8208;dithiocarbazate complexes are documented. This report reveals the detailed study of Ru(II) complexes as effective anticancer agents by inducing a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted apoptotic mode of cell death in human cancer cells.







Abstract
The reaction of the Ru(PPh3)3Cl2 with HL1&#8722;3&#8722;OH (&#8722;OH stands for the oxime hydroxyl group; HL1&#8722;OH=diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;benzyldithiocarbazonate; HL2&#8722;OH=diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;(4&#8208;methyl)benzyldithiocarbazonate; and HL3&#8722;OH=diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro)benzyl&#8208;dithiocarbazonate) gives three new ruthenium complexes [RuII(L1&#8722;3&#8722;H)(PPh3)2Cl] (1&#8211;3) (&#8722;H stands for imine hydrogen) coordinated with dithiocarbazate imine as the final products. All ruthenium(II) complexes (1&#8211;3) have been characterized by elemental (CHNS) analyses, IR, UV&#8208;vis, NMR (1H, 13C, and 31P) spectroscopy, HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry and also, the structure of 1&#8211;2 was further confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The solution/aqueous stability, hydrophobicity, DNA interactions, and cell viability studies of 1&#8211;3 against HeLa, HT&#8208;29, and NIH&#8208;3T3&#8197;cell lines were performed. Cell viability results suggested 3 being the most cytotoxic of the series with IC50 6.9&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;M against HeLa cells. Further, an apoptotic mechanism of cell death was confirmed by cell cycle analysis and Annexin V&#8208;FITC/PI double staining techniques. In this regard, the live cell confocal microscopy results revealed that compounds primarily target the mitochondria against HeLa, and HT&#8208;29&#8197;cell lines. Moreover, these ruthenium complexes elevate the ROS level by inducing mitochondria targeting apoptotic cell death.

         <title>A Molecular Insight into the Dehydration of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and its Impact on the CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD simulations were used to investigate the reasons for CALF&#8208;37&#8242;s resistance to water, as well as its uptake capacity and selectivity to CO2 vs. N2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous material formed by the self&#8208;assembly of metallic ligands and organic linkers. They are a good candidate for CO2 gas capture because they have large surface areas and the metal or linker can be tuned to improve CO2 uptake. In the quest for water and acid stable MOFs, a phosphonate&#8208;based organic linker has recently been designed by Glavinovic et&#8197;al. (Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202200874). By combining ionic calcium nodes, water and methanol molecules, they formed a microporous network, CALF&#8208;37. This network has been shown to be robust and can maintain its pore shape even in absence of water molecules or by the inclusion of gas molecules, such as CO2. The network can be heated to release the water and methanol molecules and form a dehydrated MOF, which retains its shape with the imprinted pore within. Herein, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to provide insight into the CO2 capture and sequestration ability of the CALF&#8208;37. We model the dehydration of the inactivated MOF (HCALF&#8208;37) in the absence and in the presence of methanol molecules by progressively withdrawing water molecules from the MOF networks. We determine the crystal structure of the intermediate states from HCALF&#8208;37 to CALF&#8208;37 and shed light on the critical role of water molecules in the mediation of metal&#8208;linker bonds. Our calculations also reveal that the favorable interactions between the CO2 molecules and the aromatic core of the linkers and metallic ions are responsible for the efficient sequestration of the gas in the CALF&#8208;37.

A schematic diagram reflects the strong electron affinity of the fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) structure, in which the electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing amino group in the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) skeleton is replaced by a very strongly electronegative CF2 unit. Moreover, the FPD molecule, which exhibits stronger accepting characteristics, has stronger affinity against electrons than the DPP molecule.

         <title>Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aziridines and Imines to Construct 2,5&#8208;trans&#8208;Imidazolidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric [3+2] annulation to synthesize imidazolidine compounds with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diester aziridines and imines was reported. A series of chiral trans&#8208;imidazolidines were obtained in high yields with outstanding enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. Compared to the previously reported method of synthesizing imidazolines, this method could offer the imidazoline compounds with 2,5&#8208;trans&#8208;selectivity. The stereoselectivities of the products were determined by the metal/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide and the interaction of substrates as suggested by control experiments.







Abstract
An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor aziridines with N&#8208;aryl protected imines was developed with a Ni(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide catalyst system, providing a broad range of chiral trans&#8208;substituted imidazolidine compounds with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 98&#8201;% ee). Control experiments indicated that the products could offer excellent diastereoselectivities with the control of chiral Ni(II)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex and the interaction of the substrates. The possible catalytic process was proposed to rationalize the stereocontrol.

         <title>Emerging Trends in Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling Polymers: Monomer Design and Catalytic Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical recycling of polymers back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin polymers offers a solution for the end&#8208;of&#8208;use problems of plastics and the potential to establish a circular material economy. This concept focuses on the critical advantages of chemically recyclable polymers in terms of monomer design, material properties, and the feasibility of bulk depolymerization.







Abstract
Plastics are indispensable materials in modern society; however, their extensive use has contributed to the depletion of finite natural resources and caused severe environmental issues. One end&#8208;of&#8208;use solution for plastics involves the chemical recycling of polymers back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin polymers without changing the material properties, allowing the establishment of a circular material economy. This concept focuses on the critical advantages of chemically recyclable polymers in terms of monomer design, material properties, and the feasibility of bulk depolymerization. The recyclability via bulk thermolysis of various polyesters, CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates, and polyacetals produced via ring&#8208;opening polymerization is highlighted through discussions regarding rational monomer design and efficient catalyst development. An outlook and perspective are provided to delineate the future challenges in the rational design of monomer and polymer structures that deliver the desired materials performance while being suitable for bulk thermolysis with high (de)polymerization activity and selectivity.

         <title>Cooperative Friedel&#8211;Crafts Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes via Catalyst Activation with Hexafluoroisopropanol
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the challenging and scantily explored Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes using a &#8220;catalyst activation&#8221; approach. Through strong hydrogen bonding with solvent hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst is increased which stabilizes the transition states of the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction via concerted mechanism.







Abstract
A Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes with aldehydes through &#8242;&#8242;catalyst activation&#8242;&#8242; is presented. Through hydrogen bonding interactions, the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3, &#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) interacted with the added Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst pTSA&#8226;H2O, increasing its acidity. This activated catalyst enabled the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;neutral as well as electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Strongly electron withdrawing arenes including arenes with multiple halogen atoms, NO2, CHO, CO2R, and CN, groups acted as efficient nucleophiles in this reaction. DFT studies reveal multiple roles of solvent HFIP viz; increasing the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst pTSA&#8226;H2O, and stabilization of the transition states through a concerted pathway enabling the challenging reaction.

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. We introduce here a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying our catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and various substituted benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;DHPs with high efficiency.

         <title>Electrooxidative Rearrangement for Remote Functionalizations of Unactivated Alkenes through Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical strategy for the dual functionalizations of unactivated alkenes through an intramolecular migration process was realized in the absence of sacrificial chemical oxidants and noble&#8208;metal catalysts under mild reaction conditions. The electrochemistry enabled a (hetero)aryl migration, while providing access to alkenyl/alkynyl&#8208;migration products. Thus, electricity was employed for the formation of functionalized fluoroalkyl radicals through activation of C&#8211;H/C&#8211;Br bonds from fluorinated esters via a distal radical migration process. Thereby, we obtained a variety of di and mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl products with good functional group tolerance as well as chemo, and regioselectivities. Likewise, defluorinative allylation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl alkyl bromides proved viable. The reaction mechanism was established by experiments and computation.</dc:description>

         <title>In Search of Hosts for Blue OLEDs: Computational Design and Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aid of DFT calculations was implemented for exploring a space search of 780 molecules. The selection process was designed to find material designs with the highest theoretical triplet energy (&gt;2.81&#8197;eV) along with suitable HOMO/LUMO levels to accommodate the chosen blue dopant (FIrpic). The outcome of the virtual screening process and corresponding device performances have provided an adventitious outcome that will help discard poor candidates at the virtual screening step.







Abstract
Considering the difficulties associated with the conventional &#8216;trial and error&#8217; method for a complete analysis of a giant molecular space, we took the aid of computational pathway (DFT) in screening a large space search of 780 (12&#215;13&#215;5) molecules to search for a host for the blue emitter. The selection process was completed in three Tiers with the conditions of highest theoretical triplet energy (&gt;2.81&#8197;eV), aligned HOMO/LUMO levels w.r.t blue dopant (FIrpic), and position of substituents to meet the optimal requirements as host materials. Tier 1 screened twelve different imidazole heterocycle derivatives as base space groups which resulted in the selection of 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole. Tier 2 process converged the search to mCN&#8208;CZ having the highest triplet energy and appropriate HOMO/LUMO level relative to FIrpic and ETL. Further, the carbazole of mCN&#8208;CZ was replaced with different aromatic hydrocarbons to find the other best compound in terms of triplet energy and HOMO/LUMO. Tier 3 resulted in another promising candidate (mCN&#8208;FL) as possible host materials. The band alignment with guest predicted mCN&#8208;FL and mCN&#8208;CZ to have optimal device performances compared to CZ&#8208;CZ and the experimentally observed device performance was in accordance with virtual screening results when TAPC was utilized as the hole transporter. The device results of mCN&#8208;CZ and mCN&#8208;FL were better than the reference host TCTA. The obtained results thus proved that a virtual screening process will be a useful tool for synthetic chemists in designing task&#8208;specific materials.

         <title>Mesoporous CuFe2O4&#160;Photoanodes for Solar Water Oxidation: Impact of Surface Morphology on the Photoelectrochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal oxide&#160;photoelectrodes for solar water splitting often utilize nanostructures to&#160;reduce&#160;charge transport distances and increase&#160;the photocurrent for materials with short minority charge carrier diffusion lengths. While nanostructuring is well established, the effect of surface order on the photocurrent and carrier recombination has not yet received much attention in literature. To evaluate the impact of pore ordering on the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties, mesoporous CuFe2O4 (CFO) thin film photoanodes were prepared by dip&#8208;coating and soft&#8208;templating. Here, the pore order and geometry can be controlled by addition of copolymer surfactants poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(propylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#160; (Pluronic&#160;F&#8208;127), polyisobutylene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethyleneoxide) (PIB&#8208;PEO) and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (Kraton liquid&#8208;PEO, KLE). The non&#8208;ordered CFO showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.2&#160;mA/cm2 at 1.3 V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation, but the least photocurrent for water oxidation. Conversely, the ordered CFO presented the best PEC water oxidation performance. These differences can be understood on the basis of the high surface area which promotes hole transfer to sulfite (a fast hole acceptor), but retards oxidation of water (a slow hole acceptor) due to electron&#8208;hole recombination at the defective surface. This interpretation is confirmed by intensity&#8208;modulated photocurrent&#160;and vibrating Kelvin probe surface photovoltage spectroscopy. The lowest surface recombination rate was observed for the ordered KLE&#8208;based mesoporous CFO, which retain spherical pore shapes at the surface resulting in fewer surface defects. Overall, this work shows that the PEC energy conversion efficiency of CFOs is not just controlled by the surface area, but also by surface order.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Extent of the &#8220;Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers&#8221; Effect in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: Effect of Copper Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation of supramolecular helices, e.g. through interdigitation of their alkyl side chains or through more directional supramolecular interactions, leads to hierarchical architectures with original structural and chiroptical properties. However, when a chiral monomer (the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;) is introduced as a minor component in these assemblies composed of a majority of achiral monomers (the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;), it is not clear how the aggregation changes the ability of the sergeant to induce a preferential helicity to the polymer main chain (the so&#8208;called &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect). We report herein a detailed investigation of the influence of [Cu(OAc)2&#8226;H2O] coordination on the structure and chiroptical properties of helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;assemblies composed of a catalytically&#8208;active benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, acting as the &#8220;soldier&#8221;, and an enantiopure BTA monomer derived from cyclohexylalanine, playing the role of the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;. The copper actually significantly influences the extent of the &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect since it acts as a crosslink that induces some chiral defects in the supramolecular helices. These crosslinks appear to be preserved during the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4&#8208;nitroacetophenone. The aggregation of helices through the formation of copper crosslinks is reversible since homochiral single helices are exclusively formed in the case of sergeant&#8208;rich assemblies. The fact that both main chain and side chain aggregation affects the chiroptical properties of supramolecular helices must be considered in the design of elaborated chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with superior electrochemical performance and long&#8208;term stability is crucial to the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, graphited carbon with high specific surface area was obtained under relatively low temperature using Ni&#8208;catalyst, then ordered nanoparticles (NPs) PtNi catalysts attaching to graphited carbon were synthesized via polyol reduction and thermal treatment. Benefiting from graphitized carbon support and appropriate order degree, PtNi/GC&#8208;700 NPs catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR performance with specific and mass activities as high as 2.8&#8208;fold and 3.7&#8208;fold of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared PtNi/GC&#8208;700 catalyst exhibits superior stability with negligible degradation after 10,000 potential cycles, due to its ordered chemical structure. The work described herein highlights the potential of electrocatalysts with the ordered structurally for efficient and durable fuel cell cathodic catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, stereo&#8208; or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, etc., have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi&#8208;steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst&#8208;substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8211;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In our study, we combined biochemical sparse isotope&#8208;labeling techniques, a unique DNP method, and well&#8208;established dipolar recoupling in order to create isolated polarization transfer chains that, for the first time, allow us to follow the polarization transfer chain from the protein to the RNA.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202203443).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Alexander Marchanka at the Leibniz University of Hannover and Bj&#246;rn Corzilius at the University of Rostock. The image depicts the local generation of nuclear spin hyperpolarization, which selectively &#8220;illuminates&#8221; the interaction surface of a ribonuclear protein complex for solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniaxially Oriented Sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm Line Patterns of Hybrid Liquid Crystals Constructed by Perylene Diimide and Oligo(Dimethylsiloxane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perylene diimide&#8208;based disc&#8208;coil liquid crystals containing oligo(dimethylsiloxane) chains can form lamellar and columnar phases, and large&#8208;area uniaxially orientated nanolines can be obtained through thin&#8208;film self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Construction of sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm long&#8208;range ordered structures through self&#8208;assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5&#8197;nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Colob), and hexagonal columnar (Colh) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5&#8197;nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5&#8197;nm can be obtained on PDMS&#8208;modified silicon substrates by spin&#8208;casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long&#8208;range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5&#8197;&#956;m2) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre&#8208;patterning. These nanostructures provide the possibility of preparing nanotemplates by oxygen plasma etching.

         <title>Combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly for organopalladium cages with fine&#8208;tuned structure and function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete organopalladium coordination cages have shown great potential in applications ranging from molecular recognition and sensing, drug delivery to enzymatic catalysis. While many of the known organopalladium cages are homoleptic structures with regular polyhedral shapes and symmetric inner cavities, heteroleptic cages with complex architectures and new functions coming from their anisotropic cavities have received an increasing attention recently. In this concept article, we discuss a powerful combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy toward the construction of a family of organopalladium cages, including both homoleptic and heteroleptic ones, from a given library of ligands. Within such a cage family, the heteroleptic cages often feature systematically fine&#8208;tuned structures and emergent properties, distinct from their parent homoleptic counterparts. We hope the concepts and examples provided in this article can offer some rational guidance for the design of new coordination cages toward advanced functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical behavior of self&#8208;organizing derivatives of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carboranes, and their bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and benzene analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four series of isostructural derivatives of 3&#8208;ring liquid crystalline derivatives containing p&#8208;carboranes (12&#8208;vertex A, and 10&#8208;vertex B), bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (C), or benzene (D) as the variable structural element were investigated for their mesogenic behavior and electronic interactions. Comparative studies demonstrated that the effectiveness of elements A&#8211;D in stabilization of the mesophase typically increases in the order: B &lt; A &lt; C &lt; D. Absorption and emission spectroscopy for the four series and reference compounds augmented with DFT computational results revealed that the degree of electronic interactions with the connected benzene &#960; system increases in the order C &lt; A &lt; B &lt; D. Emission spectra exhibit large Stokes&#8217; shifts for 10&#8208;vertex derivatives (B) in solutions and in the solid state. Spectroscopic characterization was supplemented with polarization electronic spectroscopy and solvatochromic studies of selected series. Overall, 12&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane A acts as an electron withdrawing auxochromic substituent with interactions similar to those of BCO, although capable of accepting some electron density in the excited state. In contrast, 10&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane B is much more interactive with the &#960;&#8208;aromatic electron manifold and exhibits greater ability to participate in photo&#8208;induced CT processes. Absorption and emission energies and quantum yields (1&#8208;51%) for carborane derivatives, representing the D&#8211;A&#8211;D system, were compared to those of their isoelectronic zwitterionic analogues (the A&#8211;D&#8211;A system).

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions&#8208;Assisted Polymorphism and Unique Mechanofluorochromism in 9, 10&#8208;Bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorinated distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivative, 9, 10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene abbreviated as 4FDSA with two crystalline polymorphs (4FDSA&#8208;G (green emission) and 4FDSA&#8208;O (orange emission)), showing remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and mechanoflurochromic characteristics, was developed. One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F&#8230;F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non&#8208;polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA&#8208;NC) at aggregating conditions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fluorinated distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivative, 9, 10-bis((E)-4-(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene abbreviated as 4FDSA with two crystalline polymorphs (4FDSA-G (green emission) and 4FDSA-O (orange emission)), showing remarkable aggregation-induced enhanced emission and mechanoflurochromic characteristics, was developed. One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F&#8230;F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non-polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA-NC) at aggregating conditions. Even though, the both polymorphs show distinct tricolor luminescence switching on the action of mechanical force, fumigation of ground crystals with solvent vapor resulted in the formation of a more thermodynamically favorable 4FDSA-NC form. The work demonstrates the effect of supramolecular interactions assisted conformational changes in tuning the unique mechanofluorochromic characteristics of the polymorphic crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Acylation of Pyranosides with Immobilized Oligopeptide Catalysts in Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the immobilization of oligopeptide catalysts and their use in the site&#8208;selective acetylation of different monosaccharides. The catalysts are easy to synthesize, can easily be reused for several reactions, and are able to perform well in first continuous flow experiments.







Abstract
We report the site&#8208;selective acetylation of partially protected monosaccharides using immobilized oligopeptide catalysts, which are readily accessible via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The catalysts are able to invert the intrinsic selectivity, which was determined using N&#8208;methylimidazole, for a variety of pyranosides. We demonstrate that the catalysts are stable for multiple reaction cycles and can be easily reused after separation from the reaction solution. The catalysts can also be used in flow without loss of reactivity and selectivity.

         <title>Templating Influence of Regulated Inorganic Framework in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ferroelastic Perovskites: (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M=Mn and Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites (C3H5CH2NH3)2MnCl4 and (C3H5CH2NH3)2CdCl4 experience reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with Aizu notation of 4/mmmFmmm. Upon substitution of metal center Mn with Cd in the inorganic frameworks, the phase transition temperature is successfully increased while the ferroelastic property is well maintained.







Abstract
The remarkable material stability and structural diversity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) constitute a vast available library of versatile materials. In particular, ferroelastic property, for which the spontaneous strain can be transformed by applying mechanical stress, is very promising for extensive nanotechnological applications. However, integrating ferroelastic property into 2D OIHPs is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed two new 2D OIHPs (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M=Mn for 1 and Cd for 2), which undergo reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with an Aizu expression 4/mmmFmmm. The templating influence of the more distorted inorganic framework on the disordering of organic cations and the stronger hydrogen bonds has a key role in the striking improvement of Curie temperature from 246&#8197;K in 1 to 273&#8197;K in 2. Meanwhile, the minimized alteration of structural motif ensures the well maintaining of the ferroelastic performance in the forms of crystals and thin films, as demonstrated by the identifiable evolution of domain structures. This work will provide a fertile new ground for enlarging the limited number of 2D ferroelastic OIHPs with better practical utility.

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8211;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like bright stars in a dark sky, sparsely 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups in the protein domain &#8220;illuminate&#8221; the binding pocket of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex for specific solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy of the interaction surface by localized transfer of their hyperpolarization to 13C&#8208;labeled adenosines in the RNA domain. This is enabled by specific cross&#8208;relaxation enhancement by active motions under dynamic nuclear polarization (SCREAM&#8208;DNP) in combination with homonuclear dipolar recoupling. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Marchanka, B. Corzilius and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203443).

         <title>A Semiconductor Biohybrid System for Photo&#8208;Synergetic Enhancement of Biological Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoncapsulation of E. coli by tannic acid (TA)&#8208;Fe complexes enhances its stability in seawater. Further, different types of nanomaterials can be easily introduced to the surface of E. coli using TA&#8722;Fe shells as a biological interface. The E. coli&#8208;based semiconductor biohybrid system prepared by nanoencapsulation and hybridisation can significantly enhance hydrogen production activity under illumination and shows good stability in seawater.







Abstract
CdS nanoparticles were introduced on E. coli cells to construct a hydrogen generating biohybrid system via the biointerface of tannic acid&#8208;Fe complex. This hybrid system promotes good biological activity in a high salinity environment. Under light illumination, the as&#8208;synthesized biohybrid system achieves a 32.44&#8201;% enhancement of hydrogen production in seawater through a synergistic effect.

         <title>Total Syntheses of (+)&#8208;Villocarine A, (&#8722;)&#8208;Apogeissoschizine, and (+)&#8208;Geissoschizine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geissoschizine is a very important biosynthetic intermediate of monoterpenoid alkaloids in higher plants. In this study, the enantioselective and stereodivergent total syntheses of geissoschizine and two related indole alkaloids (villocarine&#8197;A and apogeissoschizine) were achieved. The three synthesized natural products are represented as Nishikigoi (varicolored carp), which are also called &#8220;swimming jewels&#8221; in Japan, and the cascade reaction is represented by their graceful swimming along a river. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Ishikawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300179).

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Dependent Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Janus Emulsion Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform is based on an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;functionalized surfactants in response to a trigger&#8208;induced decrease in the selective surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8211;liquid interface area of reconfigurable biphasic Janus emulsions.







Abstract
We report a novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform that relies on an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based surfactants localized at one hemisphere of biphasic micro&#8208;scale Janus emulsion droplets. Dynamic alterations in the available interfacial area were evoked through surfactant&#8208;induced dynamic changes of the internal droplet morphology that can be modulated as a function of the balance of interfacial tensions of the droplet constituent phases. Thus, by analogy with a Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett trough that enables selective concentration of surfactants at a liquid&#8211;gas interface, we demonstrate here a method for controllable modulation of the available interfacial area of surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. We show that a morphology&#8208;dependent alteration of the interfacial area can be used to evoke an optical signal, by selectively assembling synthesized TPE&#8208;based surfactants on the respective droplet interfaces. A trigger&#8208;induced increase in the concentration of TPE&#8208;based surfactants at the liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces results in an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), inducing an up to 3.9&#8208;fold increase in the measured emission intensity of the droplets.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable, Malleable, Ecofriendly Recyclable and Robust Polyimine Thermosets Derived from Trifluoromethyl Diphenoxybenzene Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FPIVs films were successfully fabricated and evaluated. Owing to the presence of aromatic monomers and fluorine effect as well as the high cross&#8208;linking density of dynamic imine bonds, FPIVs films not only exhibited superior mechanical properties and self&#8208;healable behavior but also realized closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry opens up great opportunities for a sustainable society by producing reprocessable networks of polymers and even thermosets. However, achieving the closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers with high performance remains a grand challenge. The introduction of aromatic monomers and fluorine into covalent adaptable networks is an attractive method to tackle this challenge. Therefore, we present a facile and universal strategy to focus on the design and applications of polyimine vitrimers containing trifluoromethyl diphenoxybenzene backbones in applications of dynamic covalent polymers. In this study, fluorine&#8208;containing polyimine vitrimer networks (FPIVs) were fabricated, and the results revealed that the FPIVs not only exhibited good self&#8208;healability, malleability and processability without the aid of any catalyst, but also possessed decent mechanical strength, superior toughness and thermal stability. We hope that this work could provide a novel pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance polyimine vitrimers by recycling of plastic wastes.

Travelling without moving. A Ferrier rearrangement on commercial glycals brings the double bond from position 1,2 to 2,3. Subsequent Aza&#8208;Wacker reaction allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position 3 and movement of the double bond restoring the glycal. These motions, reminiscent of a swing, enable the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Epoxidation/Glycosylation of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative provide a disaccharide with high yield, defining &#8220;FAWEG&#8221; as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced In Situ Generation of Br&#248;nsted Acid for Catalytic Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;induced indole 2&#8208;alkylation reaction was developed with unactivated stereo&#8208;congested alkenes used as the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reagent. The neutral, traceless and inexpensive perfluoroalkyl iodide C4F9I was used as the radical initiator in catalytic amount under irradiation by a blue LED light. Br&#248;nsted acids are in situ generated from the radical transfer reactions between the indole substrates and the perfluoroiodide catalyst. A variety of 2&#8208;branched alkylated indole molecules could be obtained from this approach in generally good efficiencies, with a broad scope of functional groups well tolerated. Mechanistic studies via both experimental and computational methods indicate that the reaction was accelerated by the protons generated from the crack of the indole&#8208;derived radical cation species.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways in radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is a sustainable and atom&#8208;efficient method to generate C&#8211;C bonds, especially to produce fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A significant amount of research has therefore been devoted to applying this methodology, which resulted in innovative routes toward otherwise synthetically challenging products and a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalytic systems. Furthermore, combined experimental and theoretical efforts elucidated the reactivity of carbene radical complexes and their off&#8208;cycle pathways. The latter can imply the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes, and undesired hydrogen atom transfer by the carbene radical species from the reaction medium which can lead to catalyst deactivation. In this concept paper, we demonstrate that understanding off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways not only affords solutions to circumvent them, but can also uncover novel reactivity for new applications. In particular, considering off&#8208;cycle species involved in metalloradical catalysis can stimulate further development of radical&#8208;type carbene transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Predicting Ionic Cocrystal Formation: the Case of Ammonium Nitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the mature predictive frameworks applied to neutral cocrystals, ionic cocrystals, those including an ion pair, are difficult to design. Furthermore, they are generally excluded categorically from studies which correlate specific molecular properties to cocrystal formation, leaving the prospective ionic cocrystal engineer with few clear avenues to success. Herein ammonium nitrate, an energetic oxidizing salt, is targeted for cocrystallization in a potential coformer group selected based on likely interactions with the nitrate ion as revealed in the Cambridge Structural Database; six novel ionic cocrystals were discovered. Molecular descriptors previously identified as being related to neutral cocrystal formation were examined across the screening group but showed no relationship with ionic cocrystal formation. High packing coefficient is shown to be a constant among the successful coformers in the set and is utilized to directly target two more successful coformers, bypassing the need for a large screening group.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral, Heteroleptic [Cu(I)(PPh3)2(4H&#8208;imidazolato)] Complexes: Ligand Exchange Reactivity, Redox Properties, Excited&#8208;State Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu(I) 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes are rare examples of Cu(I) complexes with chelating anionic ligands and are potent photosensitizers with unique absorption and photoredox properties. In this contribution, five novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes with monodentate triphenylphosphine co&#8208;ligands are investigated. As a consequence of the anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate ligand and in contrast to comparable complexes with neutral ligands, these complexes are more stable than their homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) congeners. Here, the ligand exchange reactivity was studied by 31P&#8208;,19F&#8208;, and variable temperature NMR and the ground state structural and electronic properties by X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by femto&#8208; and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed differences, with respect to chelating bisphosphine bearing congeners, are often due to the increased geometric flexibility of the triphenylphosphines. These observations render the investigated complexes interesting candidates for photo(redox)reactions not accessible with chelating bisphosphine ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Hinges by Fusion of Pyrrole and Dithiin: Synthesis, Structure, Redox Chemistry and Host&#8208;guest Complexation of Dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins (PDs), were prepared and fully characterized by NMR, UV/vis, cyclic voltammogram, ESR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The lateral fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiins has led to not only retained key features of a dithiin, but also enhanced redox&#8208;activity with increased susceptibility to radical cations via redox or chemical oxidation. Stabilization of their radicals are observed for the N,N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl or N,N&#8208;triphenylmethyl PD as evidenced by ESR measurements. DFT calculations and SCXRD analysis revealed PD s are extremely flexible with adaptive molecular geometries that can be mechanically regulated via crystal packing or host&#8208;guest complexation. The excellent donor nature of PD s renders inclusion complexes with the cyclophane bluebox (cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene)), featuring association constants up to 104 M&#8210;1. Additionally, a planarized transition intermediate associated with inversion dynamics of a PD has been preserved in the pseudorotaxane structure with assistances of &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and S&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive nature of PDs could further enable accesses to exotic redox switchable host&#8208;guest chemistry and functional materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A missing family of the extremely air sensitive tripentelyltrielanes was discovered. Their stabilisation was achieved by using the bulky NHC IDipp (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The tripentelylgallanes and tripentelylalanes IDipp &#8729; Ga(PH2)3 (1a), IDipp &#8729; Ga(AsH2)3 (1b), IDipp &#8729; Al(PH2)3 (2a) and IDipp &#8729; Al(AsH2)3 (2b) were synthesised by salt metathesis of IDipp &#8729; ECl3 (E = Al, Ga, In) with alkali metal pnictogenides such as NaPH2/LiPH2 &#8729; DME and KAsH2, respectively. Moreover, the detection of the first NHC&#8208;stabilised tripentelylindiumane IDipp &#8729; In(PH2)3 (3) was possible by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Initial investigations of the coordination ability of these compounds resulted in the successful isolation of the coordination compound [IDipp &#8729; Ga(PH2)2(&#181;3&#8208;PH2{HgC6F4}3)] (4) by reaction of 1a with (HgC6F4)3. The compounds were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Regioisomeric Alternating Borane&#8208;Terthiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borane polymers: Using robust dithienylborane monomers, a series of alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers are obtained by Stille coupling polymerization methods. Variations in the attachment point of boron on the terthiophene linker and the electronic structure of the pendent aryl (Ar) moiety give rise to luminescent materials with divergent optical and electronic properties.







Abstract
Main&#8208;chain boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are attractive for organic electronic, sensing, and imaging applications. Alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers were prepared and the effects of regioisomeric attachment of the conjugated linker and variations in the electronic effect of the pendent aryl groups (2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, Mes*; 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, FMes) examined. Pd2dba3/P(t&#8208;Bu)3&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization of arylbis(2&#8208;thienyl)borane and arylbis(3&#8208;thienylborane) with 2,5&#8208;bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave polymers with appreciable molecular weight but MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses showed evidence of unusually prominent homocoupling. These defects could be suppressed by using brominated rather than iodinated monomers, more hindered 2,5&#8208;bis(tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylstannyl)thiophene as comonomer, and Pd2dba3/P(o&#8208;tol)3 as the catalyst at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, macrocyclic species with n=3&#8211;10 repeating units formed preferentially according to MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses. Photophysical studies revealed a prominent effect of the regiochemistry and the nature of the pendent aryl groups on the absorption and emission, giving rise to orange, yellow&#8208;green, blue&#8208;green, and blue emissive materials respectively. The electronic effects were rationalized through DFT calculations on bis(terthiophene) model systems.

Optically active #&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramers, in which the p&#8208;arylene&#8208;ethynylenes were stacked at the terminal benzene units, were synthesized. They composed of bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes. Two kinds of #&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramers (parallel&#8208;type and weave&#8208;type) were formed depending on the &#960;&#8208;staked manner. The weave&#8208;typed cyclic tetramer exhibited excellent CPL behavior with high glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of optically active cyclic tetramers comprising four stacked &#960;&#8208;electron systems from two enantiomerically pure [2.2]paracyclophane compounds (bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane compounds). Depending on the combination of the absolute configurations of the planar chiral pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophane units, the cyclic tetramers formed either parallel&#8208;#&#8208; or weave&#8208;#&#8208;structures. The optical and chiroptical properties of both structures were investigated experimentally and theoretically. In particular, the weave&#8208;#&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramer exhibited good chiroptical properties and emitted circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high anisotropy factor (|glum| value of the order of 10&#8722;3) and a CPL brightness (BCPL) higher than 100.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Coupled with Organic Conversion to Selectively Synthesize High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling CO2 reduction and organic conversion can create a win&#8208;win situation, and this can not only obtain high&#8208;value chemicals with high selectivity, but also reduce reaction overpotential and improve energy efficiency. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of different coupling systems, and propose opinions for further development of this direction.







Abstract
The electrochemical process of coupling electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and organic conversion reaction can effectively reduce the reaction overpotential and obtain value&#8208;added chemicals. Moreover, because of the diversity of substrates and the designability of coupling forms, more and more attention has been paid to this field. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of coupling electrolysis in recent years, (1) co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and organics at the cathode to obtain specific products with high selectivity, (2) replacing traditional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other valuable oxidation reactions to improve energy utilization efficiency and economic benefits of CO2 conversion, (3) in an electrolytic cell without membrane, the cathode and anode jointly transform CO2 and organics to redox products. We hope that the examples and insights on coupling electrolysis introduced in this review can inspire researchers to further explore and innovate in this direction.

         <title>5&#8208;(Trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium Triflate: Introducing the 1,1,2&#8208;Trifluoroethylene Tether in Drug&#8208;Like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key reagent to introduce trifluoroethylene: A protocol for the connection of alcohols and (hetero)arenes via a trifluoroethylene linker has been developed. Key for the development of this procedure has been the synthesis of a sulfonium salt bearing a trifluorovinyl substituent. This reagent suffers the addition of alcohols to the activated double bond and subsequently generates alkyl fluoride radicals by mesolytic cleavage of the S&#8722;C bond after one electron reduction.







Abstract
This manuscript reports the synthesis and structure of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5&#8208;(trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the introduction of the bioisosteric 1,1,2&#8208;trifluoroethylene linker in drug&#8208;like structures. The protocol developed consists of the reaction of this compound with alcohols and phenols to deliver a complete set of 1,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(alkoxy&#8208;/aryloxy)ethyl sulfonium salts, which have been purified by column chromatography and fully characterized. Subsequent single electron reduction under mild photochemical conditions efficiently affords the corresponding fluoroalkyl radicals that are trapped either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly through their reaction with (hetero)arenes. Theoretical calculations are used to evaluate the conformational consequences derived from the presence of the CF2&#8722;CHF tether.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free Engineering toward Efficient Zinc Storage: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free engineering strategies in each assembly components are summarized to homogenize Zn2+ diffusion and electric field at the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based energy storage has lately gained popularity due to natural abundance, operational safety, high energy density. Unfortunately, dendrite growth is a common and intractable issue faced in existing zinc&#8208;ion batteries to shorten cycle lifespan/stability. This review summarizes recent progress in assembly component (e.&#8201;g., anode, electrolyte, separator) engineering for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;ion batteries. First, diversiform strategies of Zn surface modification and Zn host design are presented to shield the fundamental adverse effect aroused by uneven zinc deposition on the anode. Then, subtle deployments of electrolyte constituents are illustrated to optimize the Zn2+ solvation structure for ultimate dendrite control and Coulombic efficiency elevation in aqueous systems and beyond (e.&#8201;g., eutectic electrolytes). Furthermore, rational manipulation of advanced separators and the upgrade of zinc metal&#8208;free Zn2+&#8208;storage devices are briefly discussed to explore the dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;storage. Finally, challenges and perspectives are proposed to offer research inspirations toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Polychloromethylamination of Styrenes through C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new three&#8208;component procedure for the polychloromethylaminative synthesis of &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines has been developed. With simple styrenes, polychloromethanes, and aromatic amines as substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;dichloromethyl amines were isolated in moderate to good yields by using aryldiazonium salt as radical initiator.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction has been developed allowing the rapid building of valuable complex highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines from simple styrenes, arylamines, and dichloromethane/chloroform. Using aryldiazonium salts as a radical initiator, a series of corresponding products are obtained with moderate to good yields under a carbon dioxide or nitrogen atmosphere (50&#8197;psi). In addition, good functional group tolerance can be observed.

Seeing red! Strong donor&#8208;acceptor diads based on novel imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (IPDC) electron acceptors exhibit blue to near infrared emission, as well as delayed emission such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP).

Abstract
Three donor&#8208;acceptor compounds based on the imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (IPDC) acceptor were synthesized. The IPDC emitters exhibit blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission with up to 54&#8201;% photoluminescent quantum yield. 9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (ACR), phenoxazine (POX), and phenothiazine (PTZ) served as electron donors. IPDC&#8208;POX displayed NIR emission in toluene solution, while showing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in the solid state. IPDC&#8208;ACR exhibited yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Interestingly, dual&#8208;emissive behavior as well as excitation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was found for IPDC&#8208;PTZ, arising from the two conformers of phenothiazine derivatives. Overall, this work describes a novel strong electron acceptor from the fusion of imidazole, pyrazine, and nitrile functional groups into one conjugated heterocycle for materials exhibiting NIR emission, TADF, and/or room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP).

         <title>Toward a Comprehensive Understanding of Amorphous Photocatalysts: Fundamental Hypotheses and Applications in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helping amorphous photocatalysts to take shape: Although developing an amorphous photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction may be challenging, it can perform better than crystalline photocatalysts if specific properties are considered. These include light harvesting, charge kinetics, short&#8208;range active sites, and reaction mechanisms. EXAFS and machine learning could be powerful tools for gaining insights into amorphous photocatalysts.







Abstract
In principle, photocatalytic activity can be precisely controlled with crystalline catalysts. However, an amorphous photocatalyst could be a viable candidate for CO2 photoreduction to form value&#8208;added products. The amorphous phase is currently part of the crystalline material in several ongoing CO2 photoreduction studies. Additionally, no study indicates the amorphous material required for overall CO2 photoreduction. This perspective review article highlights fundamental assumptions that are necessary to gain insights and understand the effectiveness of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction. We start with basic ideas and theories about these materials, including light harvesting, variable coordination number, and the interaction of CO2 molecules with the amorphous catalytic surface. To understand the prospects of the amorphous photocatalyst, we explore machine learning with EXAFS. Furthermore, we discuss product selectivity and regeneration of photocatalysts in detail. Finally, we briefly review the work in progress on amorphous materials and compare it to that on crystalline ones.

         <dc:description>Nanolobatone A, featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[10.3.0.01,2]pentadecane carbon skeleton, along with four new polyoxygenated and four unusual endoperoxide&#8208;bridged casbane&#8208;type diterpenoids were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sinularia nanolobata. The structures of the new compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of new isolates was proposed.

         <dc:description>The Li+ ion conductor Li27&#8722; x [P4O7+ x N9&#8722; x ]O3 (x &#8776; 1.9) has been synthesized from P3N5, Li3N and Li2O in a Ta ampoule at 800 &#176;C under Ar atmosphere. The cubic compound crystallizes in space group I [[EQUATION]] 3d with a = 12.0106(14) &#197; and Z = 4. It contains both non&#8208;condensed [PO2N2]5&#8722; and [PO3N]4&#8722; tetrahedra as well as O2&#8722; ions, surrounded by Li+ ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6 &#215; 10&#8722;8 S cm&#8722;1 with an activation energy of 0.46 &#177; 0.02 eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li27&#8722; x [P4O7+ x N9&#8722; x ]O3 an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.</dc:description>

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;perylene Charge Transfer Compounds: Sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up&#8208;conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPY heterochromophores asymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions were prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses show that the torsion angle between BODIPY and perylene units lie between 73.54 and 74.51, but they are not orthogonal.&#160; Both compounds show intense, charge transfer absorption and emission profiles, confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy and consistent with DFT calculations. The emission quantum yield was solvent dependent but emission profile remained characteristic of CT transition across all solvents explored. Both BODIPY derivatives were found to be effective sensitizers of TTA&#8208;UC with perylene annihilator in dioxane and DMSO.&#160; Intense anti&#8208;Stokes emission was observed, and visible by eye from these solvents. Conversely, no TTA&#8208;UC was observed from the other solvents explored, including from non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene and hexane that yielded brightest fluorescence from the BODIPY derivatives. In dioxane, the power density plots obtained were strongly consistent with TTA&#8208;UC and the power density threshold, the Ith value ( the photon flux at which 50% of &#934;TTAUC is achieved), for B2PI was observed to be 2.5x lower than of B2P under optimal conditions, an effect ascribed to the combined influence of spin&#8211;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) and heavy metal &#160;on the triplet state formation for B2PI.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship on NiRu alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N&#8208;doped carbon towards efficient hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjusting the crystal phase&#160;of metal alloy is an important method to optimize catalytic performance. However, its detailed understanding about the relationship for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still limited. In this work, the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing the N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. It is found that the NiRu@NC (mix)&#160;with both face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) and thermodynamically unstable hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase NiRu give the best HER performance. Further activity studies demonstrate that hcp NiRu has better HER performance, and NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (~70%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27 mV @ 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. The high HER activity of NiRu@NC (mix) is attributed&#160;to the formation of hcp phase. This finding indicates that the regulation of crystal structure can provide a new strategy for optimizing HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Engineering of Red Luminogens to Realize High Emission Efficiency Through ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR, &gt; 650 nm) emissive organic luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviours have emerged as promising candidates for the applications in optoelectronic devices and biological fields. However, the molecular design philosophy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with narrow band gaps are rarely explored. Herein, we rationally designed two red organic luminophores, FITPA and FIMPA, by considering the enlargement of transition dipole moment in the charge&#8208;transfer state and the transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE. The transition dipole moments were effectively enhanced with a &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; molecular configuration. Meanwhile, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA was induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation originated from a crystallization&#8208;induced emission (CIE) effect because of additional weak interactions in the aggregate state introduced by methoxy groups. Owing to the enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behaviour, FIMPA presented intense luminescence covering the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 38% in solid state. The promising cell&#8208;imaging performance further verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications. These results provide a guideline for the development of red and NIR AIEgens through comprehensive consideration of both the effect of molecular structure and molecular interactions in aggregate states.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly E&#8208;Selective Olefin Synthesis Catalysed by Novel Quinoxalinone Photocatalyst under Visible Light Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photo&#8208;induced olefin synthesis, the photocatalysts with high triplet energy could cause the isomerization of olefins. This study demonstrates a new quinoxalinone photocatalytic system for highly stereoselective alkenes preparation from alkenyl sulfones and alkyl boronic acids. Our photocatalyst could not convert the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;olefin to Z&#8208;olefin, guaranteeing the high E&#8208;configuration selectivity of the reaction. There is weak interaction between boronic acids and quinoxalinone according to NMR experiments, probably decreasing the oxidation potential of boronic acids. This system can be further extended to the allyl and alkynyl sulfones to give corresponding alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (iHOF&#8208;10, iHOF&#8208;11) by using 1,1&#697;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#697;&#8208;bipyridine diiodide (DBpy&#8729;2I) and tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE). With increasing RH and temperature, water molecules induce single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformation of iHOF&#8208;10, resulting in the formation of iHOF&#8208;11. At 98% RH, the proton conductivity of iHOF&#8208;11 (7.03 &#215; 10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1) is 2.09 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (3.37 &#215; 10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1) at 90 &#176;C. At 50 &#176;C, iHOF&#8208;11 (9.49 &#215; 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1) is 19.06 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (4.98 &#215; 10&#8211;5 S cm&#8211;1). The proton conductivity shows water molecules enter the crystal and induce crystal transformation and reorganization of the hydrogen bonding structure, thus increasing the proton conductivity and stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The emergence of catalytic activity associated with a disassembly process is reported, reminiscent of complex biological systems. A cystine derivative with pendant imidazole groups self&#8208;assembles into cationic nanorods in the presence of the cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Disulfide reduction triggers nanorod disassembly and the generation of a simple cysteine protease mimic, which shows a dramatically improved catalytic efficiency in the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA).</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from an o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron Clusters Facilitating a Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Spherical boron cluster. An o&#8208;carborane dyad (MTCb) with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture was developed as a high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material. Compared to the carborane&#8208;free MTY, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb showed a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, resulting from the presence of icosahedral boron clusters.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75&#8197;nm and a sensitivity of 19.1&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Aliphatic C&#8722;H Methylation of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A concise strategy relying on multifunctional iron catalysis in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide has been reported, allowing rapid and highly selective C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation of various glycine derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
Direct and selective C&#8722;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8722;H modification of biomolecules and natural products.

         <title>Transition Metal Vacancy in Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the formation of transition metal (TM) vacancy, vacancy contained configurations for triggering oxygen redox, advanced characterization techniques for detecting TM vacancy and viable strategies to improve the reversibility of vacancy&#8208;induced oxygen redox for layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Anionic redox has been considered as a promising strategy to break the capacity limitation of cathode materials that solely relies on the intrinsic cationic redox in secondary batteries. Vacancy, as a kind of defect, can be introduced into transition metal layer to trigger oxygen redox, thus enhancing the energy density of layer&#8208;structured cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the formation process, recent progress in working mechanisms of triggering oxygen redox, as well as advanced characterization techniques for transition metal (TM) vacancy were overviewed and discussed. Strategies applied to stabilize the vacancy contained structures and harness the reversible oxygen redox were summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for further understanding TM vacancy were particularly emphasized.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Release of Secondary Amine Bases for the Activation of Catalysts and Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apart from their properties as self&#8208;healing materials, DCv ureas can be applied as starting points for triggered reaction cascades. Input such as heat and water can release free base on demand. We apply this release system for the deprotection of a latent organocatalyst to catalyse acylhydrazone formation as well as for on&#8208;demand gelation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent (DCv) ureas have been used abundantly to design self&#8208;healing materials. We demonstrate that apart from self&#8208;healing materials, the species present in the equilibrium of DCv ureas can be employed as responsive organocatalysts. Easily controllable stimuli like heat or addition of water shift the equilibrium towards isocyanate and free base which can function as an in situ released reagent. We demonstrate this application of DCv ureas with two examples. Firstly, we use the liberated base to catalytically activate a latent organocatalyst for acylhydrazone formation. Secondly, this base can be employed in an equimolar manner to trigger the release of nitrile&#8208;N&#8208;oxides from chlorooximes, which react with acrylate&#8208;terminated polymers to form an isoxazoline polymer gel.

         <dc:description>We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure of cornexistin bound to the transketolase enzyme from Zea mays, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine&#8208;membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Anionic Chains of Pnictogenylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;membered chains of substituted anionic compounds composed of both boron and pnictogen (phosphorus and/or arsenic) atoms are synthesized from the reaction of pnictogenide salts with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 (E=P, As). Such compounds can be further reacted with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 to form unprecedented five&#8208;membered anionic group 13/15 oligomers.







Abstract
An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported. Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 (E&#8242;=P, As) with pnictogen&#8208;based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E=P, As; R1=H, R2=tBu; R1=R2=Ph; M=Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EHtBu] (3: E=E&#8242;=P; 4: E=E&#8242;=As; 5: E=As, E&#8242;=P) and [M(C)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (7: E=E&#8242;=P, M=Na, C=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; 8: E=E&#8242;=As; M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 9: E=P, E&#8242;=As, M=Na, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 10: E=As, E&#8242;=P, M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2As&#8722;BH2&#8208;tBuPH&#8722;BH3] (6) is only accessible by a different pathway, using tBuPH2, BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and NaNH2 as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl&#8208;substituted compounds [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][Ph2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (11: E=P, M=Na; 12: E=As, M=K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9&#8242; (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;R1R2P&#8722;BH2&#8722;E&#8242;H2] (E=E&#8242;=P, R1=H, R2=tBu (13); E=E&#8242;=P, R1=R2=Ph (14); E=E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (15); E=P, E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (16)). Finally, the thermodynamics of the reaction pathways were evaluated by quantum chemical computations.

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unprecedented intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between allenes and silicon&#8208;bearing olefins is presented. This is also the first example of the reagent&#8208;controlled regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes. The products in this work were oil compounds. The crystal sponge method was successfully used to determine their structures.







Abstract
This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction's sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Crosslinked Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of homobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for Pd6L4 cages enabled crosslinking of the metal&#8208;organic cages and subsequent network formation, leading to supramolecular polymer hydrogels. The hydrogels allow for non&#8208;covalent guest uptake and release using ultrasound from aqueous solution.







Abstract
We report the formation of metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5&#8197;nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG3&#8211;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates were constructed as a novel photothermal agent with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 61&#8201;% upon 808&#8208;nm laser irradiation. The application of PtSnBi nanoplates for photothermal cancer therapy both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was successfully carried out, suggesting that PtSnBi nanoplates have great promise in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8764;61&#8201;% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tetraarylethylenes Enabled by Reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dimetallation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraarylethylenes (TAEs) have been gaining attentions from various scientific disciplines for their characteristic chemical and physical properties. From the synthetic perspective, however, efficient methods for the selective synthesis of different isomers of TAEs are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of TAEs by means of sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes. Subsequent transmetallation to zinc generates trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, which underwent the stereoselective arylation under a palladium catalysis to afford a variety of TAEs that had been difficult to prepare according to the conventional procedures. In addition, the present method accommodates not only diarylacetylenes but also alkyl aryl acetylenes and thus enables to synthesize a wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of Catalytic Centres in Light&#8208;driven Hydrogen Evolution by Oligonuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A review. In the past decades, mimicking natural photosynthesis by artificial photocatalysis represented a major research direction towards the final goal of reducing the consumption of fossil fuels by efficiently harvesting solar energy. To transfer molecular photocatalysis from the lab scale to an industrially relevant process, it is important to overcome instability problems of the catalysts during light&#8208;driven operation. As it is well&#8208;known that many of the typically utilized noble metal&#8208;based catalytic centres (e.g.&#160;Pt and Pd) undergo particle formation during (photo)catalysis and thus switch the whole process from a homogeneous into a heterogeneous one, an understanding of the factors governing particle formation is crucially needed. The review therefore focuses on di&#8208; and oligonuclear photocatalysts bearing a range of different bridging ligand architectures for drawing structure&#8208;catalyst&#8208;stability relationships in light&#8208;driven intramolecular reductive catalysis. In addition, ligand effects at the catalytic centre and its consequences on the catalytic activity in intermolecular systems will be addressed, as well as yielding important insights into the future design of operationally stable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Copper(I) and Silver(I) be Hydrogen Bond Acceptors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated on 3AuCl+ (3+ = 1&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;((dimethylammonio)methyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) complex. However, similar hydrogen bonding interactions with isoelectronic silver(I) or copper(I) centers are unknown. Herein, we first explored whether the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond originally observed in 3AuCl+ can be strengthened by replacing Cl with Br or I. Experimental gas&#8208;phase IR spectra in the ~3000 cm&#8208;1 region showed only a small effect of the halogen on the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond. Next, we measured the spectra of 3AgCl+, which exhibited significant differences compared to its 3AuX+ counterparts. The difference has been explained by DFT calculations which indicated that the Ag&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H interaction is only marginal in this complex, and a Cl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H hydrogen bond is formed instead. Calculations predicted the same for the 3CuCl+ complex. However, we noticed that for Ag and Cu complexes with less flexible ligands, such as dimethyl(2&#8208;(dimethylammonio)phenyl)phosphine (L&#8311;H + ), the computations predict the presence of the respective Ag&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and Cu&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H hydrogen bonds, with a strength similar to the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond in 3AuCl+. We, therefore, propose possible complexes where the presence of (Ag/Cu)&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bonds could be experimentally verified to broaden our understanding of these unusual interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited a N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of TNFN exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically in the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour is found comparing the transition temperatures of the NF phase which are higher for the NT3F.m series, and this may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of those materials. This suggests that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.</dc:description>

         <title>A cyclodextrin polymer as supramolecular matrix for scalable green photooxygenation of hydrophobic substrates in homogeneous phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2&#160;in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>ASSESSING COMBINATIONS OF B(C6F5)3 AND N2&#8208;DERIVED MOLYBDENUM NITRIDO COMPLEXES FOR HETEROLYTIC BOND ACTIVATION</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two different dinitrogen&#8208;derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type heterolytic E&#8211;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E = Si) and HB(C6F5)2. Whereas Si&#8211;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C6F5)2 was shown to substitute B(C6F5)3 in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8211;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;driven reactivity of a dinuclear copper dimethylglyoxime complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1) that, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increase the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#181;2&#8208;O&#8208;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields 2,3&#8208;butanedione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that depending on the solvent is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A new Type of Valence Tautomerism in Cobalt Dioxolene Complexes &#8211; Temperature&#8208;Induced Transition from a Cobalt(III) Catecholate to a Low&#8208;Spin Cobalt(II) Semiquinonate State</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of the monocationic cobalt(III) catecholate complex [Co(L&#8208;N4 t Bu2)(Cl2cat)]+ (L&#8208;N4 t Bu2 = N,N&#8217;&#8208;Di&#8208;tert.&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, Cl2cat2&#8208; = 4,5&#8208;dichlorocatecholate) are presented. The complex exhibits valence tautomeric properties in solution; but, in contrast to the usually observed conversion from a cobalt(III) catecholate to a high&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate state, valence tautomerism of [Co(L&#8208;N4 t Bu2)(Cl2cat)]+ leads to the formation of a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex upon raising the temperature. This new type of valence tautomerism for a cobalt dioxolene complex has been unambiguously established by a detailed spectroscopic investigation using variable&#8208;temperature NMR, IR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Determination of the enthalpies and entropies characterizing the valence tautomeric equilibria in various solutions shows that the influence of the solvent is almost exclusively entropic.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of Carbazole&#8208;based Metal&#8211;organic Frameworks by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed highly porous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole&#8208;type linkers. The novel topological structure of these MOFs was revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Molecular adsorption/desorption experiments indicated that these MOFs are flexible and change their structure upon adsorption/desorption of organic solvents and gas molecules. These MOFs exhibit unprecedented properties that allow controlling their flexibility by adding a functional group onto the central benzene ring of the organic ligand. For example, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating substituents increases the robustness of the resulting MOFs. These MOFs also exhibit flexibility&#8208;dependent differences in gas&#8208;adsorption and &#8208;separation performance. Thus, this study represents the first example of controlling the flexibility of MOFs with the same topological structure via the substituent effect of functional groups introduced into the organic ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Marigold Flower&#8208;Shaped Metal Organic Framework Supported Manganese Vanadium Oxide Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reactions in an Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in many renewable energy systems. The development of low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;lasting alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts, particularly functional electrocatalysts with high activity for OER processes, is crucial for reducing the operating expense and complexity of renewable energy generating systems. This work describes a concise method for generating marigold flower&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) aided manganese vanadium oxide via a hydrothermal procedure for increased OER activity. As synthesized MOF MnV oxide has a higher surface area due to the 3D flower&#8208;like structure, which is reinvented with enhanced electrocatalytic active sites. These distinctive structural features result in remarkable catalytic activity for MOF MnV oxide microflower towards OER with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 50 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope with only 50.1 mV dec&#8208;1 in alkaline conditions. This study provides a concise method for developing an optimized catalytic material with greater morphology and beneficial features for potential energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Construction of Corrole&#8208;peptide Conjugates by Controllable Bilane Formation on Resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Corroles have attracted increasing research interests in recent decades owing to their unique properties over porphyrins. However, the relatively inefficient and tedious synthetic procedures of corrole building blocks with functional groups for bioconjugation hindered their bioapplications. Herein, we report a highly efficient protocol to synthesize corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates with good yields (up to 63 %) without using prepared corrole building blocks. By condensing two &#8208;COOH&#8208;bearing&#8208;dipyrromethane molecules onto an aldehyde group on resin&#8208;bound peptide chains in a controllable manner, a series of desired products with long (up to 25 residues) and bioactive peptide chains were obtained with at most one chromatographic purification. The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is&#160;firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#160;composite is&#160;modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag&#160;(ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is&#160;captured in microplate surface by the&#160;conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is&#160;transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode&#160;(SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1&#160;to 200 pM&#160;with a detection limit of 0.8 pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is&#160;successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is&#160;also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpectedly Large Structural Variations in Benzyl&#8208;Substituted Sila[1]ferrocenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of four planar&#8208;chiral sila[1]ferrocenophanes equipped with a benzyl group in the &#945;&#8208;position, either on one or both Cp rings, and substituted on the bridging silicon atom, either by methyl or phenyl groups, were prepared. While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring&#8208;tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.</dc:description>

While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X-ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring-tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis of the Cloke&#9472;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement is an important method to construct heterocycles which was conventionally facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases. A weak interaction catalysis approach to the Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement remains a challenging topic and yet no example is reported. Herein, we describe a chalcogen bonding catalysis method to achieve the Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement that involves activation of carbonyl cyclopropanes by double Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. This chalcogen bonding catalysis approach afforded a wide range of dihydrofurans with good yields, thus establishing an alternative strategy to catalyze the Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction was used to investigate the reduction of WO3 to WO2 and V2O5 to V2O3 under hydrogen gas with regard to intermediate oxides and bronzes as well as influence of the heating and hydrogen&#8208;flow rates.







Abstract
The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both on the laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen was investigated by in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and the influence of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 and VO2 in two modifications were identified as intermediates on the way to phase&#8208;pure V2O3. None of the intermediates occurs in a single phase and therefore cannot be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, the heating and flow rates have little influence on the formation of intermediates.

         <title>Trace Explosive Detection Based on Photonic Crystal Amplified Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace TNT detection enabled by the amplification effect of photonic crystal on fluorescence signals is achieved. The photonic crystal&#8208;based sensor chips can sense trace explosive TNT in different environments, including air, environmental wastewater, and contaminated soil.







Abstract
With increasing demand for public security and environmental protection, it is highly desirable to develop strategies to identify trace explosives (e.&#8201;g., 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT)). Herein, we report novel photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based sensor chips for trace TNT detection by using amplification effect of PCs on fluorescence (FL) signals. The sensor chips are constructed by integrating silica nanoparticles (NPs) modified with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer (FITC) and PC substrates. The amino groups on FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs can specifically bind with TNT molecules to form Meisenheimer complexes and strongly quench the FL signal of neighboring fluorophores FITC through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. PCs with matched PBG can amplify the FL signal of FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs about 24.4&#8208;fold and significantly improve sensitivity and resolution of trace TNT detection with the limit of detection of 0.23&#8197;nM. The PC&#8208;based sensor chips are stable, sensitive, and reliable TNT sensing platforms, showing great potential in homeland safety and environmental protection.

         <title>Fast Motions Dominate Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Tau Protein at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) at low temperatures are composed of multiple components such as segmental motions and local conformational fluctuations. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral density analysis of 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates demonstrates that local backbone and relaxation&#8208;active segmental chain dynamics of IDPs might merge into an effectively single dynamic component at sufficiently high temperatures.







Abstract
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly based on 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where the amide&#8208;water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we investigate protein dynamics in a 441&#8208;residue long IDP, tau protein, in the temperature range from 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C, using 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates and spectral density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics and chain segmental motions, the temperature&#8208;dependent trend of spectral densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective synthesis of the functionalized trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization has been developed. This method enabled the convergent total synthesis of nebularilactone A and the first total synthesis of kamebanin via a novel formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement reaction and an unprecedented Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type D&#8208;ring formation reaction.







Abstract
Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17&#8197;steps, overall yield; 6.5&#8201;%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type reaction for the construction of the D&#8208;ring.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol derivative containing photoactivable and clickable groups was synthesized by a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3+2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.

Abstract
A novel and green method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;thiocyanatobenzothiophenes via electrochemical&#8208;oxidation promoted difunctionalization of active alkyne has been developed. In this protocol, inexpensive and easily available potassium thiocyanate was chosen as the thiocyanation reagent, 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles as the substrates, a variety of 3&#8208;thiocyanatobenzothiophenes were obtained in moderate to good yields under oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the continuous flow system has good applicability for this transformation, the use of continuous flow system has overcome the disadvantage of low efficiency in traditional electrochemical amplification, and realized the stable and excellent yields of target products in the scale&#8208;up reactions.

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu bound to A&#946; (heads of the meteorites) produces reactive oxygen species (tails) that attack the brain. In the presence of the azamacrocyclic ligand 3N1S (the green belt), the Cu ions are removed by the ligand (the head of the meteorite is broken) and the ROS production is abolished (the tail disappears). Hence, the brain is safe behind its shield. In absence of 3N1S, the ROS produced by Cu(A&#946;) attack the brain, which is &#8220;destroyed&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Esmieu, C. Hureau, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203667).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nontoxic and energy&#8208;efficient COF synthesis: Covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 has been successfully obtained in a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis, replacing the traditional organic&#8208;based solvent with water and reducing reaction times from several days to 30&#8197;minutes. High&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis resulted in higher BET specific surface areas (compared to traditional solvothermal processes), improved material yields, and excellent textural properties.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8722;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8208;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2 times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ephrin type&#8208;A receptor 2 (EPHA2) belongs to the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. There are several indications of an involvement of EPHA2 in the development of infectious diseases and cancer. Despite pharmacological potential, EPHA2 is an under&#8208;examined target protein. In this study, we synthesized a series of derivatives of the inhibitor NVP&#8208;BHG712 and triazine&#8208;based compounds. These compounds were evaluated to determine their potential as kinase inhibitors of EPHA2, including elucidation of their binding mode (X&#8208;ray crystallography), affinity (microscale thermophoresis), and selectivity (kinobeads assay). Eight inhibitors showed affinities in the low nanomolar regime (KD &lt; 10 nM). Testing in up to seven colon cancer cell lines that express EPHA2 reveals that several derivatives feature promising effects for control of human colon carcinoma. Thus, we have developed a set of powerful tool compounds for fundamental new research on the interplay of EPH receptors in a cellular context.</dc:description>

         <title>In cellulo light&#8208;induced dynamics in a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Thus, their biophysical properties are well established in solution, while their photophysical properties in cellulo, i.e., in the environment, in which the dyes are designed to function, are generally understood less. To address this issue, we present a sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption study of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad designed as a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) probe of the local viscosity in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8209;a]isoquinolines via 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce fullerene (C70) as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#1060;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical via energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, which acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process, which further participates in [3 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Dihaloalkenynes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the PdII&#8208;catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self&#8208;haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro&#8208;oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole&#8208;containing, pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione&#8208;containing and silyl&#8208;protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloroalkenyne or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;chloroalkenyne products as desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient reaction has been developed for thioesterification of aldehydes via radical relay by NHC catalysis. The key step is the coupling of the Breslow radical cation with the heteroatom radical (sulfur&#8208;radical). The excellent yields and broad substrate scope illustrated the efficiency of this strategy for achieving novel reactions via NHC catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.

         <title>Ge32Co9&#8722;x: Creating &#8220;Empty&#8221; Space by High Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable phase Ge32Co9&#8722;x has been synthesized at high&#8208;pressure and temperature. It adopts a new structure type with three&#8208;core heteroclusters and unique chemical bonding. Units of three condensed cubes interconnect by sharing vertices and edges. As a result, two congruent frameworks interpenetrate while being separated by &#8220;empty space&#8221; housing lone pairs and covalent Ge&#8722;Ge bonds.







Abstract
The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x=0.54(6), a=10.9861(3)&#8197;&#197;, space group Im
m) prepared under high pressure and at high temperature is metastable under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8722;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real&#8208;space methods revealed three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8722;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms. The electrical conductivity is metal&#8208;like.

         <title>Probing Peptidylprolyl Bond cis/trans Status Using Distal 19F NMR Reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine in model peptides provides an accurate and non&#8208;biased reporter of peptidylprolyl cis&#8208;trans conformational status by 19F NMR at physiological pH, even when several residues away from proline. In simple models, the prolyl bond conformational populations are predominantly governed by the amino acids local to proline and are conserved across different model systems.







Abstract
A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH&#8197;7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.

         <title>Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.







Abstract
Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block&#8208;localized wavefunction method (BLW&#8208;ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi&#8208;open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&#8722; to I&#8722;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi&#8208;open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi&#8208;open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.

         <title>C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Bond Activation, Lewis&#8208;Base Coordination and One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Oxidation at a Linear Aminoborylene</title>

An isolable linear aminoborylene: A dicoordinate cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene isoelectronic with an allene undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation under photolytic conditions, intramolecular aryl migration in the presence of acetonitrile, one&#8208;electron oxidation with copper(I) halides to the corresponding haloboryl radicals, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like binding of CO and reduction of N2O, sulfur and selenium, the latter yielding a terminal boraselenone.







Abstract
A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP=2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiply bonded &#960; radical HBP has been generated and characterized for the first time. Bonding analysis suggest that it differs from the isovalent HNB since the unpaired electron occupies one of the doubly degenerate &#960; bonding MOs, resulting in a B&#8722;P bond order of two and half.







Abstract
The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. Four new bonds are formed in one step in the final key step. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and supported by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations.

A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines, containing a 5&#8208;azatetracene and a 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. In the final key step four new bonds are formed in one step. The synthetic approach allows for a high degree of diversification of the heterocyclic core structure. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations. Due to the presence of the 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, the typical electronic nature and characteristics of the 5&#8208;azatetracene moiety are lost and the compounds are electronically and optically more related to 2&#8208;azapyrenes.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent&#8208;shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent&#8208;shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano&#8208;confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].







Abstract
Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8211;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F=68&#8201;%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F=2&#8201;%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.

         <title>Ab Initio Metadynamics Simulations of Hexafluoroisopropanol Solvent Effects: Synergistic Role of Solvent H&#8208;Bonding Networks and Solvent&#8208;Solute C&#8722;H/&#960; Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Ab initio metadynamics simulations under explicit solvent environments were performed to investigate the promotion effect of HFIP solvent in Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and Cope rearrangement reactions. The H&#8208;bonding network and the HFIP&#8208;substrate C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction are identified as the major factors affecting reactivity.







Abstract
The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.

         <title>High&#8208;Tc 1D Phase&#8208;Transition Semiconductor Photoluminescent Material with Broadband Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1) was successfully designed and synthesised. It realized the coupling of thermo&#8208;dielectric switching characteristics, semiconductor characteristics and photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission.







Abstract
One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskites have the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase&#8208;transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F]&#8901;PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition point of Tc=374&#8197;K/346&#8197;K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06&#8197;eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase&#8208;transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Induced Bathochromic Emission in Columnar Discotic Liquid Crystals Realized by Intramolecular Planarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most organic thermochromic fluorescent materials exhibit thermo&#8208;induced hypsochromic emission due to the formation of excimers in ordered molecular solids; however, it is still a challenge to endow them with bathochromic emission despite its significance in making up the field of thermochromism. Here, we report a thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission in columnar discotic liquid crystals realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores. We synthesized a kind of three&#8208;armed discotic molecules of dialkylamino&#8208;tricyanotristyrylbenzenes, which preferred to twist out of the core plane to accommodate ordered molecular stacking in hexagonal columnar mesophases, giving rise to bright green monomer emission. However, intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores occurred in isotropic liquid increasing the conjugation length, and as a result led to thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission from green to yellow light. This work reports a new concept in the thermochromic field and provides a novel strategy to achieve fluorescence tuning from intramolecular actions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;phase solvation&#160;of halides by 1,3&#8208;butadiene&#160;has been studied via a combination of photoelectron&#160;spectroscopy and density functional theory.

         <title>Control over Dethreading Kinetics Allows Evaluating&#160;the Entropy Stored in an Interlocked Molecular Machine Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analysed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for ultrasensitive detection of chloramphenicol: experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, we proposed the first electrode using high conductive metal organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol, and demonstrated that Pd can be loaded onto HCMOFs to design the electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2 nM (64.6 pg/mL) was observed, which is 1&#8208;2 order of magnitude lower than those of the reported materials as well as chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24 h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large content of Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation consistently point out that the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 is PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, combining high conductivity and large loading of electrocatalysts, can be of great advantages for ultrasensitive detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Bipolar&#8208;Charged Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, we examined gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge distributions along the gel networks. We found that the charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, &#8211;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, &#8211;COO&#8208;) play crucial roles in controlling the crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8208;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because they easily desorb from the crystallization fronts. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Activity of an Alcohol Dehydrogenase by Using &#8220;Aromatic Residue Scanning &#8221; at Potential Plasticity Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An alcohol dehydrogenase LkADH was successfully engineered to exhibitimproved activity and substrate tolerance for the production of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol, an important precursor of ticagrelor. Five potential hotspots were identified for enzyme mutagenesis by using natural residue abundance as an indicator to evaluate their potential plasticity. A semi&#8208;rational strategy named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221; was applied to randomly mutate these five sites simultaneously by using tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as &#8220;exploratory residues&#8221; to introduce steric hindrance or potential &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The best variant Lk&#8208;S96Y/L199W identified with 17.2&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency could completely reduce up to 600 g/L (3.1 M) 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethenone in 12 h with &gt;99.5% ee, giving the highest space&#8208;time yield ever reported. This study, therefore, offers a strategy for mutating alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce aromatic substrates and provides an efficient variant for the efficient synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ aliovalent substitution induced dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (O v ). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, i.e. 98%, 93%, 96%, 92% and 90% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial O v , leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a highly air stable and eco&#8208;friendly methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) perovskite&#8208;like material has been prepared by benign approach. After physiochemical characterizations, synthesized MA3Bi2I9 was utilized as photo&#8208;catalyst towards hydrogen production application. It is important to design and synthesize the lead (Pb)&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;like material (MA3Bi2I9) for photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen production applications. The synthesized MA3Bi2I9 exhibits excellent performance towards the photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen generation. The MA3Bi2I9 showed photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen production rate of 11.43 &#181;molg&#8208;1h&#8208;1. The MA3Bi2I9 exhibited excellent hydrogen production rate of 172.44 &#181;molg&#8208;1h&#8208;1 in presence of platinum co&#8208;catalyst. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst also demonstrated excellent cyclic stability for the photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure &#8208; property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in colour upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in e.g. tintable glass.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a new method for the detection of genomic RNA that combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). We first screened 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40% cleavage and one with &gt;60% in 10 min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, we evaluated 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5 hours.</dc:description>
