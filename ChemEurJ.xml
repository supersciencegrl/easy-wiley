         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8208;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8226;&#8208;) on Fe&#8208;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8208;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8226;&#8208; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8208;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8208;&#8226; formation between 1.14 and 1.4 V and an optimized potential at 1.24 V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8226;&#8208; at 1.24 V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt; 1.4 V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Chemisorption&#8208;Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co&#8208;regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption&#8208;catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo2X4, M = Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X = O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co&#8208;regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for repaid discovery of high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel = Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45 eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#160;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99 eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#160;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#160;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E = In and vertices as well as edges for E = Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Utilization of CO2: A Big Show of Si&#8208;based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high&#8208;performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1 eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high&#8208;value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si&#8208;based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) undergo a reversible light&#8208;induced arylotropy between para&#8208; and ana&#8208;quinone states. The structure&#8208;switch relationships, mechanism of molecular photochromism as well as potential applications and prospects of PAQs in optically switchable materials and devices are discussed.







Abstract
Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some long&#8208;known yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50&#8197;years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.

Borirenes and boriranes, both featuring a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring, represent a class of compounds that combine substantial ring strain with Lewis acidity. Further fusion with benzene and o&#8208;carborane through a shared CC bond leads to benzoborienes and carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, which exhibit even higher ring strain. This minireview summarizes their synthesis and reactivity and offers perspectives.







Abstract
Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the structural analogues of cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. In addition to their ability to form adducts with Lewis bases and the capacity of borirenes to act as ligands in coordination with metals, both borirenes and boriranes exhibit ring&#8208;opening reactivity due to the considerable ring strain. Under specific conditions, coordinated boriranes can even cleave two BC bonds to serve as formal borylene sources (although the reaction mechanisms are quite complex). On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues (also referred to as carborane&#8208;fused boriranes) have introduced novel perspectives to this field. For instance, they display excellent ring&#8208;expanding reactivity, possibly attributed to the boosted ring strain arising from the fusion of borirenes with benzene and boriranes with o&#8208;carborane. Importantly, their applications as valuable &#8220;BC2&#8221; synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.

         <title>Structural Impact of N&#8208;terminal Pyroglutamylate in an Amyloid&#8208;&#946;(3&#8208;42) Fibril Probed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid state NMR spectroscopy on fibrils of recombinant, pyroglutamylated [U&#8208;13C,15N]&#8208; pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) show highly similar &#946;&#8208;strand positions and a conserved turn region around V24 comparable to LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. Due to missing D1&#8208;A2 and pE3 formation a salt bridge of K28&#8208;D1' is absent in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils. G37&#8208;G38 act as sensors for the N&#8208;terminal modifications in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils.







Abstract
Extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques, primarily formed by A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils, are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The A&#946; peptide can undergo a high variety of different post&#8208;translational modifications including formation of a pyroglutamate (pGlu, pE) at N&#8208;terminal Glu3 or Glu11 of truncated A&#946;(3&#8208;x) or A&#946;(11&#8208;x), respectively. Here we studied structural similarities and differences between pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) and LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils grown under identical conditions (pH&#8197;2) using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the central region of pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils including the turn region around V24 is almost identical to A&#946;(1&#8208;42) showing similar &#946;&#8208;strands also at the N&#8208;terminus. The missing N&#8208;terminal residues D1&#8208;A2 along with pE3 formation in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) preclude a salt bridge between K28&#8208;D1' as in A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. G37 and G38 act as highly sensitive internal sensors for the modified N&#8208;terminus, which remains rigid over ~five pH units.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1:1 complex between receptor 1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103 M&#8208;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor 1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N Fused Porphyrins: Molecular Structures and Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds were synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar = Ph for 1a; Ar = C6F5 for 2a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds were established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8208;N fused molecules are ~40 nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8208;N fusion diminishes the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis showed only three oxidation processes. DFT studies revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron induces a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of new isomers of collinolactone A which were obtained from thermal, and acid promoted rearrangements of the natural product. We are able to rationalize these findings through detailed quantum chemical computations of the involved conformers and their reactions.







Abstract
Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures form via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.

         <title>n&#8208;Type Fullerene&#8208;Carbon Dots: Synthesis and Electrochemical and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent anchoring of electron acceptors derived of [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;fullerene&#8208;methyl butyrate (PC61BM and PC71BM) to carbon dots (CD) was carried out successfully and the obtained hybrid nanomaterials characterized by means of AFM microscopy, and FTIR and XPS spectroscopies. Electrochemical and photophysical studies confirmed the electronic communication between the covalently connected units and their promise for further photo&#8208; and electronic applications.







Abstract
The covalent incorporation of C60 and C70 derivatives of the well&#8208;known n&#8208;type organic semiconductor PCBM ([6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester) onto carbon dots (CD) is described. Morphological and structural characterization reveal combined features of both pristine starting materials (CD and PCBM). Electrochemical investigations evidenced the existence of additional reduction processes to that of CD or PCBM precursors, showing rich electron&#8208;acceptor capabilities, with multistep processes in an affordable and narrow electrochemical window (ca. 1.5&#8197;V). Electronic communication in the obtained nanoconjugated species were derived from steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopies, which showed bathochromically shifted absorptions and emissions well entering the red region. Finally, the lower fluorescence quantum yield of CD&#8208;PCBM nanoconjugates, compared with CD, and the fast decay of the observed emission of CD, support the existence of an electronic communication between both CD and PCBM units in the excited state.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (LZU&#8208;713@Ni) as heterogeneous all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The superiority of bottom&#8208;up strategy was exemplified by the increased activity of LZU&#8208;713@Ni compared to both the dual catalyst system and LZU&#8208;713/Ni prepared via post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a crystalline POM@MOF (Ir&#8722;SiW) by assembling Ir metalloligands and POMs for the first time. Ir&#8722;SiW has high activity for selective oxidation sulfide to sulfoxide, with a yield of 99.5&#8201;% within 2.5&#8197;h, which is higher than the currently known POM&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate @metal&#8208;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (Ir&#8722;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5&#8197;h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm) reached 99.5&#8201;%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97&#8201;% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8722;SiW.

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;Stabilised Silylone/Germylone Leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most favourable bonding scenario in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone and germylone has been uncovered by density functional calculations and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses. The interactions between the negatively charged carborane and positively charged bis&#8208;silylene fragments in their doublet states are likely to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing bond and one covalent dative bond. These findings provide a detailed understanding of the bonding interactions within these species, helping us to infer why the carborane fragment undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements, and shed light on the fragments&#8217; stability, distribution of electron densities and often unusual reactivity.







Abstract
Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them.

     alt="Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane-bis-silylene-Stabilised Silylone/Germylone Leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA-NOCV Analyses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most favourable bonding scenario&lt;/b&gt; in carborane-bis-silylene stabilized silylone and germylone has been uncovered by density functional calculations and EDA-NOCV analyses. The interactions between the negatively charged carborane and positively charged bis-silylene fragments in their doublet states are likely to form one covalent electron-sharing bond and one covalent dative bond. These findings provide a detailed understanding of the bonding interactions within these species, helping us to infer why the carborane fragment undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements, and shed light on the fragments&#8217; stability, distribution of electron densities and often unusual reactivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have successfully isolated Si&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Ge&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilised in singlet ground states by using different donor base ligands. Driess et&#8197;al. in particular have made strides in this area, isolating carborane-bis-silylene-stabilised silylone/germylone and their N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Pb analogues.

         <title>Pertechnetate/perrhenate&#8208;capped Zr/Hf&#8208;Dihydroxide Dimers: Elucidating Zr&#8722;TcO4 Co&#8208;Mobility in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known Zr/Hf4&#8208;tetramer is cleaved in aqueous solutions by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield a dihydroxide dimer capped by these oxoanions. Structure and solution characterization of this complex along with solvent extraction studies elucidates 93Zr&#8208;99Tc co&#8208;extraction (two of the most abundant and problematic 235U fission products) during nuclear fuel reprocessing.







Abstract
Spent nuclear fuel contains heavy element fission products that must be separated for effective reprocessing for a safe and sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. 93Zr and 99Tc are high&#8208;yield fission products that co&#8208;transport in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction processes. Here we seek atomic&#8208;level information of this co&#8208;extraction process, as well as fundamental knowledge about ZrIV (and HfIV) aqueous speciation in the presence of topology&#8208;directing ligands such as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) and non&#8208;radioactive surrogate perrhenate (ReO4&#8722;). In this context, we show that the flat tetrameric oxyhydroxyl&#8208;cluster [MIV4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (and related polymers) is dissociated by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield isostructural dimers, M2(OH)2(XO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (M=Zr/HfIV; X=Re/TcVII), elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. We used these model compounds to understand the pervasive 93Zr&#8208;99Tc coextraction with further speciation studies in water, nitric acid, and tetrabutylphosphate (TBP) &#8208;kerosene; where the latter two media are relevant to nuclear fuel reprocessing. SAXS (small angle X&#8208;ray scattering), compositional evaluation, and where experimentally feasible, ESI&#8208;MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) showed that perrhenate/pertechnetate influence Zr/HfIV&#8208;speciation in water. In Zr&#8208;XO4 solvent extraction studies to simulate fuel reprocessing, we provide evidence that TcO4&#8722; enhances extraction of ZrIV, and compositional analysis of the extracted metal&#8208;complexes (Zr&#8208;ReO4 study) is consistent with the crystallized ZrIV2(OH)2(ReVIIO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8901;dimer.

         <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction of a Cyclic Zinc(II) Porphyrin Trimer with an Encapsulated Rhenium(I) Bipyridine Tricarbonyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into the trimer to create a new heterobimetallic photocatalyst. The presence of ester groups in the Zn porphyrin trimer significantly deactivated CO2 reduction. After converting the ester groups to acetoxymethyl groups, the photocatalytic activity was remarkably enhanced. The modified trimer exhibited Re&#8208;induced phosphorescence, which was quenched by an electron donor, indicating efficient electron transfer during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
We previously reported a cyclic Zn(II) porphyrin trimer in which three Zn porphyrins are alternately bridged by three 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) moieties, enabling the encapsulation of metal complexes within the nanopore formed by the Zn porphyrins. In this study, we introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into one of the bpy moieties of the cyclic trimer to form the catalytic Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;R2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Br center (R=methyl ester). The ester groups (R) play an important role in the synthesis of the cyclic structure. However, it was observed that these ester groups significantly deactivated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we converted the ester groups with a suitable reducing reagent into hydroxymethyl groups, followed by acetylation to form acetoxymethyl groups. This modification remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the cyclic trimer=Re complex system for CO2 reduction. Moreover, in the modified system, the presence of the Re complex induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of the Zn porphyrin. The phosphorescence was significantly quenched by 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, indicating that efficient electron transfer mediated by the excited triplet state of the Zn porphyrin occurs during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Electrophilic Fluorination of Silyl Dienol Ethers: a General and Selective Access to &#947;&#8208;Fluoro Enals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was achieved from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). The complete selectivity towards the &#947; position was rationalized thanks to DFT calculations.







Abstract
We describe the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro enals from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers. This simple process operates under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of functionalities. The high &#947; regioselectivity of this protocol was rationalized by means of theoretical calculations.

In a solution, emission can arise from either the locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, depending on the solvent. In PMMA films, only LE state emission occurs, but excimer&#8208;like formations reduce emission intensity. This effect was probe in Luminescent Solar Concentrator.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization: Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histidine amino acid forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The affinity of histidine in oligopeptides strongly depends on the neighbouring residues in the sequence, with the strongest binding observed for Tyr&#8208;His and Leu&#8208;His.







Abstract
Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8722;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.

         <title>Cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;hydride under electric fields: The effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on the geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity of a potential antitumor drug, namely a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex has been systematically investigated on the basis of the density functional theory.







Abstract
Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8722;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Detection of Unbound Bilirubin and Nitrophenol Explosives in Water by a Mechanosynthesized Dual Functional Zinc Complex: Recognition of Picric Acid in Various Common Organic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes label&#8208;free instant dual detection of unconjugated bilirubin and picric acid in pure aqueous solution by a mechanosynthesized luminescent zinc(II) complex, which can be performed via pH tuning of the medium.







Abstract
High levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UB) in serum lead to asymptomatic and neonatal jaundice and brain dysfunctions. Herein, we have reported the detection of UB at as low as 1&#8197;&#956;M in an aqueous alkaline medium using a Zn(II) complex. The specificity of the complex has been validated by the HPLC in the concentration window 6&#8211;90&#8197;&#956;M, which is rare. The sensory response of the probe at physiological pH against nitro explosives developed it as an instant&#8208;acting fluorosensor for picric acid (PA) and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (2,4&#8208;DNP). Spectroscopic titration provided a binding constant of 4&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 with PA. The naked eye detection was found to be 15&#8197;&#956;M. The solid&#8208;state photoluminescent nature of the complex enabled it for PA sensing in the solid phase. Interestingly, the probe remained fluorescent in various volatile and non&#8208;volatile organic solvents. As a result, it can also detect PA and 2,4&#8208;DNP in a wide range of common organic media. NMR studies revealed the coordination of PA, 2,4&#8208;DNP, and UB to the Zn(II) center of the probe, which is responsible for the observed quenching of the probe with the analytes.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Modified Silica Nanoparticles as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for the Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on spherical silica nanoparticles superficially modified with anthraquinone 2&#8208;carboxylic acid (AQ&#8208;COOH) are presented. The nanomaterial was characterized by TEM, SEM, FT&#8208;IR, diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, NMR, DLS, XRD and XPS. These analyses confirm the covalent linking of AQ&#8208;COOH with the NH2 functionality in the nanomaterial and, more importantly, the photocatalyst retains its photophysical properties once bound. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was successfully employed in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols under sustainable reaction conditions. Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100 %) with low catalyst loading (3.5 mol %), reaching TOF values of 3.7 h&#8208;1. Using 2&#8208;propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A functional electrolyte containing P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive achieves the interphase stability of high nickel cathode in a wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high nickel cathode have high specific energy, but as the nickel content in the cathode active material increases, batteries are suffering from temperature limitations, unstable performance, and transition metal dissolution during long cycling. In this work, a functional electrolyte with P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive is developed to stabilize the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)/graphite LIBs over a wide temperature range. Compared to the batteries without the additive, the capacity retention of the batteries with PDITC&#8208;containing electrolyte increases from 23% to 74% after 1400 cycles at 25 &#176;C, and from 15% to 85% after 300 cycles at 45 &#176;C. After being stored at 60 &#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved. In addition, the PDITC&#8208;containing battery has a higher discharge capacity at &#8208;20 &#176;C, and the capacity retention rate increases from 79% to 90% after 500 cycles at 0 &#176;C. Both theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results demonstrate that PDITC is involved in constructing a dense interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of the electrolyte and reducing the interfacial impedance. The application of PDITC provides a new strategy to improve the wide&#8208;temperature performance of the NCM811/graphite LIBs.</dc:description>

After being stored at 60 &#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich Nanoclusters: Synthesis, Structure, and Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A structurally precise hydride&#8208;containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich nanocluster [PtH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)6] (1) has been synthesized. It consists of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage that encapsulates a linear PtH2 unit. Upon the addition of two equivalents of CF3COOH to 1, two hydrido clusters are isolated. These clusters are [PtHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)4] (2), which is a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety, and [PtH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)3] (3), a distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit. The electronic structure of 2, analyzed by Density Functional Theory, is a 2e superatom. The electrocatalytic activities of 1&#8208;3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were compared. Notably, Cluster 2 exhibited an exceptionally excellent HER activity within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8211;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 39&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity throughout 3000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pt site plays a crucial role in the remarkable HER activity and may provide valuable insights for establishing correlations between catalyst structure and HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;Based Molecular Switches Tethered by Four&#8208;Arm Star&#8208;like Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular switches that reversibly change their structures and physical properties are important for applications such as sensing and information processing at molecular scales. In order to avoid the intermolecular aggregation that is often detrimental to the stimuli&#8208;responses of molecular switches, previous studies of molecular switches have been often conducted in dilute solutions which are difficult for applications in solid&#8208;state devices. Here we report molecular design and synthesis that integrates anthraquinodimethane as molecular switching units into polymers with amenable processibility in solid states. Optical and electron spin resonance characterizations indicate that the four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) tethered from anthraquinodimethane slow down the dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhance the photoluminescence in solid states and impart materials with a small energy gap from singlet ground state to thermally accessible triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells with Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising clean energy solution. However, their widespread adoption faces hurdles related to component optimization. This review explores the pivotal role of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing PEMFC performance, focusing on their role in polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst modification, and other components. By addressing key obstacles, ILs provide a pathway towards the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs. In the realm of PEMFC membranes, ILs have shown great potential in improving proton conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Additionally, the utilization of ILs as catalyst modifiers has shown promise in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes and reduce their agglomeration, thereby augmenting catalytic performance. Furthermore, ILs can be tailored to optimize the catalyst&#8208;support interaction, ultimately enhancing the overall fuel cell efficiency. Their unique properties, such as high oxygen solubility and low volatility, offer advantages in terms of reducing mass transport and water management issues. This review not only underscores the promising advancements achieved thus far but also outlines the challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ILs in PEMFC technology, offering a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working toward the realization of efficient and durable PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxazaborolidinones: Steric Coverage Effect of Lewis Acidic Boron Center in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxamide moiety of oxazaborolidinone (OxB) dynamically covers the Lewis acidic boron center, providing stabilizing effects on unstable boronic acids including 2&#8208;furyl, vinyl, and alkyl groups and protective effects on OxB with haloaryl groups. Reported protection is useful for iterative couplings and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with OxBs prepared from unstable arylboronic acids.







Abstract
It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide is an excellent boron&#8208;protecting group. The reaction between &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide and organoboronic acids produced stable oxazaborolidinones (OxBs), in which the 
&#8208;hybridized boron atom was sterically protected by &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide. The alkyl groups of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety can dynamically cover the p&#8208;orbital of the 
&#8208;hybridized boron center, creating a small space around the boron atom, allowing for smooth transmetalation by a Pd catalyst and easy deprotection by water. This protecting phenomenon is effective for readily purification, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with unstable boronic acids and iterative cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC).

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Condensation Reactions of Silanediols with Conservation of Solid&#8208;State&#8208;Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo&#8208; and polysiloxanes are usually prepared by condensation reactions in solvents without control of stereochemistry. Here we present a solventless thermal condensation of stable organosilanols which act as precursors in a thermal condensation reaction. We investigated the condensation reactions of organosilanediols with different organic substituents, having in common at least one aromatic group. The condensation kinetics of the precursors observed by NMR spectroscopy revealed a strong dependence on temperature, time, and substitution pattern at the silicon atom. SEC measurements showed that chain length increases with increasing condensation temperature and time and lower steric demand of the substituents, which also influences the glass transition temperatures (Tg). X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the crystalline silanediols and their condensation products revealed a structural correlation between the substituent location in the crystalline precursors and the formed polysiloxanes induced by the hydrogen bond pattern. In certain cases, it is possible to carry out topotactic polymerization in the solid&#8208;state, which has its origin in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Redox and Thermo&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Based on Cyclodextrin&#8208;Polyoxometalate Tandem</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8208;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M = Ge &#8208; Pb) (I&#8208;III) (Dipp2NacNac = HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2)and M&#180;E(SiMe3)2 (M&#180;= Li, E =As; M&#180; = K, E = Sb, Bi) (IV&#8208;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8208;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M = Ge, 2E: M = Sn,3E: M = Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8208;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8208;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8208;Se&#8208;As chain.</dc:description>

         <title>The Phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 were synthesized by heating the elements and Li3P under argon atmosphere. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. AE2Li4SiP4 crystallize in a new layered structure type (P21/m, Z = 2) with CdI2&#8208;analoguos layers. Edge sharing CaP6 octahedra are separated by layers of vertex&#8208;sharing SiP4 and LiP4 tetrahedra, which contain additional chains of LiP6 octahedra. Ba4Li16Si3P12 forms likewise a new structure type (P21/c, Z = 16) with a three&#8208;dimensional network of SiP4, Si2P6 and LiP4 entities as well as one phosphorus site not bonded to silicon. Barium is located in capped trigonal prisms of phosphorus which form strongly corrugated layers. 31P and 29Si solid&#8208;state NMR spectra confirm the crystal structures of the compounds AE2Li4SiP4. 7Li spectra show only one signal in spite of quite different crystallographic positions, which indicate possible Li+ mobility. However, this signal is much broader compared to the known Li+ conducting phosphidosilicates. Accordingly, electrochemical impedance measurements show low Li+ conductivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;ion spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8208;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of creating single&#8208;ion Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5%, 2%, 1%, and 0.1% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx = 2.07, gy = 2.12, and gz = 2.44) in the S = 1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5 ms (5%Cu), 9.2 ms (2%Cu), and 15 ms (1%Cu) at 1.8 K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21 &#956;s (2%Cu), 0.39 &#956;s (1%Cu), and 3.0 &#956;s (0.1%Cu) at 10 K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS = &#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50 K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the spin&#8211;spin interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent research progresses of Sn/Bi/In&#8208;based electrocatalysts for electroreduction CO2 to formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) can take full advantage of sustainable power to mitigate the ever&#8208;increasing global carbon emission. Recycling CO2 to produce formic acid or formate is a technologically and economically viable approach to accomplish electrochemical CO2 cyclic utilization. Developing efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts with high selectivity towards formate is prioritized for the industrialized applications of CO2RR electrolysis. From the previous explored CO2RR catalysts,&#160;Sn, Bi and In based materials have drawn increasing attentions due to the high selectivity towards formate.&#160;However, there are still confronted with several challenges for the practical applications of these materials. Therefore, a rational design of the catalysts for formate is urgently needed for the target of industrialized applications. Herein, we comprehensively summarized the recent development in the advanced electrocatalysts for the CO2RR to formate. Firstly, the reaction mechanism of CO2RR is introduced. Then the preparation and design strategies of the highly active electrocatalysts are presented. Especially the innovative design mechanism in engineering materials for promoting catalytic performance, and the efforts on mechanistic exploration using in situ (ex situ) characterization techniques are reviewed. Subsequently, some perspectives and expectations are proposed about current challenges and future potentials in CO2RR research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bench&#8208;stable Polycyclic Organophosphorus Heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type Annulations of ortho&#8208;Azidophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of a five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring is known to stabilize unstable molecular structures such as hemiacetals. This idea can also be extended to stabilize other high&#8208;coordinated p&#8208;block element species. Herein, we synthesized two novel polycyclic organophosphorus heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type annulations. Reactions of either ortho&#8208;phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides 1 or ortho&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters 4 with ortho&#8208;azidophenols 2 gave rise to penta&#8208;coordinated P(V) heterocycles, benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;thiazaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphole (B&#8208;B&#8208;TAP&#8208;OAP) 3 and benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphol&#8208;12&#8208;one (B&#8208;B&#8208;AP&#8208;OAP) 5 in satisfactory yields. It is remarkable that heterocycles 3 and 5 are both bench&#8208;stable and exhibit considerable stability in a 10% aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution. Preliminary computational studies disclosed that the formation of nitrogen gas is the key driving force for the annulations. In addition, the formation of a strong Si&#8208;F bond is another contributor to the annulation of 1 and 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress in Liquid Phase Growth of GaN Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a wide band gap semiconductor, gallium nitride (GaN) has excellent structural stability and mechanical properties, giving it unique advantages in applications such as high frequency, high power, and high temperature. As a result, it has broad application prospects in optoelectronics and microelectronics. However, the lack of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;size GaN crystal substrates severely limit the improvement of electronic device performance. To solve this problem, liquid phase growth of GaN has attracted much attention because it can produce higher quality GaN crystals compared to traditional vapor phase growth methods. This review introduces two main methods of liquid phase growth of GaN: the flux method and ammonothermal method, as well as their advantages and challenges. It reviews the research history and recent advances of these two methods, including the effects of different solvents and mineralizers on the growth quality and performance of GaN crystals, as well as various technical improvements. This review aims to outline the principles, characteristics, and development trends of liquid phase growth of GaN, to provide more inspiration for future research on liquid phase growth, and to achieve further breakthroughs in its development and commercial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Ketones for the Synthesis of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Disubstituted &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>C&#8208;C bond forming reaction of ketone with aldehyde is well&#8208;studied for the synthesis of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, however, the reaction with two different ketones to unsaturated carbonyl compound has not yet been systematically studied. Probably due to the relatively low reactivity of ketones as electrophiles (aldol acceptors), its propensity for retro&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactions often suffer from unsatisfactory chemoselectivity. In this quest, we report here for the first time selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by using ruthenium catalysis. Interestingly, single crossed aldol condensation products are formed even in reactions where a mixture of products is possible. Reaction is highly chemoselective, regioselective and produces H2O as the only byproducts. Method is compatible with a wide variety of sensitive functional group and applicable for even problematic aliphatic ketones as substrates. Notably, acetone was found as a three&#8208;carbon feedstock for the syntheses of simple &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The process can further be extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products. With the help of DFT calculations, and several control experiments, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that initial aldol&#8208;condensation of ketones to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which further isomerizes to a &#946;, &#947;&#8208; unsaturated ketone via &#951;3&#8208;allyl ruthenium complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced adhesive and mechanically robust silicone&#8208;based coating with excellent marine anti&#8208;fouling and anti&#8208;corrosion performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used in marine antifouling coatings due to its low surface energy property. However, certain drawbacks of PDMS coatings such as poor surface adhesion, weak mechanical properties, and inadequate static antifouling performance have hindered its practical applications. Herein, condensation polymerization is utilized to prepare PDMS&#8208;based polythiamine ester (PTUBAF) coatings that consist of PDMS, polytetrahydrofuran (PTMG), 2, 3, 5, 6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1, 4&#8208;benzenedimethanol (TBD) as the main chains and isobornyl acrylate(IBA) as the antifouling group. The surface adhesion to the substrate is enhanced due to the hydrogen bond between the coated carbamate group and the hydroxyl group on the surface of the substrate. Mechanical properties of PTUBAF are significantly improved due to the benzene ring and six&#8208;membered ring biphase hard structure.&#160; The strong synergistic effect of bactericidal&#160;groups and low surdace energy endows the PTUBAF coating with outstanding antifouling performance.&#160;Due to the low surface energy surface, the PTUBAF coatings are also found to possess excellent anti&#8208;corrosion. Furthermore, since the PTUBAF coatings exhibit a visible light transmittance of 91%, they can applied as protective films for smartphones. The proposed method has the potential to boost the production and practical applications of silicone&#8208;based coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern Potentiometric Biosensing Based on Non&#8208;Equilibrium Measurement Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bioreceptors, new sensing concepts, and a deeper theoretical understanding of the potentiometric responses of ISEs encourages innovations in potentiometric biosensing applications. Dynamic responses based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes offer fruitful information that can be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence technology.







Abstract
Modern potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membrane ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) have achieved new breakthroughs in sensitivity, selectivity, and stability and have extended applications in environmental surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial analysis. Moreover, nonclassical potentiometry shows promise for many applications and opens up new opportunities for potentiometric biosensing. Here, we aim to provide a concept to summarize advances over the past decade in the development of potentiometric biosensors with polymeric membrane ISEs. This Concept article articulates sensing mechanisms based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques. In particular, we emphasize new trends in potentiometric biosensing based on attractive dynamic approaches. Representative examples are selected to illustrate key applications under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes. More importantly, fruitful information obtained from non&#8208;equilibrium measurements with dynamic responses can be useful for artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of ISEs with advanced AI techniques for effective data processing is also discussed. We hope that this Concept will illustrate the great possibilities offered by non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques and AI in potentiometric biosensing and encourage further innovations in this exciting field.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with uniform shapes and precise sizes can be achieved using an appropriate supersaturated level of a solution of 1 as the growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation. This new methodology allows the living self&#8208;assembly of small molecules to proceed in two independent steps, i.&#8201;e., the design of molecules for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of a supersaturated solution with appropriate levels as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes, thus rendering a convenient and adaptable methodology for novel architectures.







Abstract
This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated level of a solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of a supersaturated solution with appropriate levels as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogs of Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of 17 diisopropyl &#945;&#8208;oxophosphonates was accomplished by using a commercially available Noyori&#8208;type catalyst. The highly enantioenriched products (ee &gt;98&#8201;% in all cases but one) were further converted to the phosphonic acid analogs of 15 aminocarboxylic acids. The established method can also be used for the asymmetric transfer deuteration (ATD) of the starting &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminophosphonic acids have a remarkably broad bioactivity spectrum. They can function as highly efficient transition state mimics for a variety of hydrolytic and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzymes, which makes them interesting target structures for synthetic chemists. In particular, the phosphonic acid analogs to &#945;&#8208;aminocarboxylic acids (PaAAs) are potent enzyme inhibitors, but many of them are only available by chiral or enzymatic resolution; sometimes only one enantiomer is accessible, and several have never been prepared in enantiopure form at all. Today, a variety of methods to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids is known but none of the reported approaches can be generally applied for the synthesis of PaAAs. Here we show that the phosphonic acid analogs of many (proteinogenic) &#945;&#8208;amino acids become accessible by the catalytic, stereoselective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates. The highly enantioenriched (enantiomeric excess (ee) &#8805; 98&#8201;%) &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates obtained are important pharmaceutical building blocks in themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogs became easily accessible from the same &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates using deuterated formic acid (DCO2H).

The highly enantioenriched (enantiomeric excess (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) &#8805; 98&#8201;%) &#945;-hydroxyphosphonates obtained are important pharmaceutical building blocks in themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;-aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogs became easily accessible from the same &#945;-oxo-phosphonates using deuterated formic acid (DCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecules that Turn Themselves Inside&#8208;Out: Tuning in/out Equilibria and Homeomorphic Isomerization in Macrobicyclic Dibridgehead Diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P Newly Accessible by Earth&#8208;Abundant&#8208;Metal Templates</title>

It&#8242;s not sorcery. Certain molecules can turn themselves inside out, akin to many articles of clothing, thus displaying two distinct external surfaces. Rates and equilibria for the title diphosphines, as well as greatly improved syntheses, are described. This provides the first in&#8208;depth mapping of such phenomena as a function of ring size for any series of aliphatic macrobicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX.







Abstract
Photolyses of trans&#8208;Fe(CO)3(P((CH2)n)3P) (n=10 (a), 12 (b), 14 (c), 16 (d), 18 (e)) in the presence of PMe3 provide the first economical and scalable route to macrobicyclic dibridgehead diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P (1). These are isolated as mixtures of in,in/out,out isomers that equilibrate with degenerate in,out/out,in isomers at 150&#8201;&#176;C via pyramidal inversion at phosphorus. For the entire series, VT 31P NMR data establish or bound Keq, rates, and activation parameters for a variety of phenomena, many of which involve homeomorphic isomerizations, topological processes by which certain molecules can turn themselves inside out (e.&#8201;g., in,in&#8652;out,out). This provides the first detailed mapping of such trends in homologous series of aliphatic bicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX with any type of bridgehead. Isomeric diborane adducts 1&#8201;a,d&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2BH3 are also characterized. Crystal structures of out,out&#8208;1&#8201;a and in,in&#8208;1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2BH3 aid isomer assignments and reveal unusual cage conformations.

         <title>Binding Properties of Small Electrophilic Anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I): Activation of Small Molecules Based on &#960;&#8208;Backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small electrophilic anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I) can bind and activate N2 and CO by performing &#960;&#8208;backdonation. This bond type is predicted by energy decomposition analysis and experimentally observed by the red shift of the bound N2/CO stretching frequency.







Abstract
Superelectrophilic anions constitute a special class of molecular anions that show strong binding of weak nucleophiles despite their negative charge. In this study, the binding characteristics of smaller gaseous electrophilic anions of the types [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (with X=Cl, Br, I) were computationally and experimentally investigated and compared to those of the larger analogues [B12X11]&#8722;. The positive charge of vacant boron increases from [B6X5]&#8722; via [B10X9]&#8722; to [B12X11]&#8722;, as evidenced by increasing attachment enthalpies towards typical &#963;&#8208;donor molecules (noble gases, H2O). However, this behavior is reversed for &#963;&#8208;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules. [B6Cl5]&#8722; binds most strongly to N2 and CO, even more strongly than to H2O. Energy decomposition analysis confirms that the orbital interaction is responsible for this opposite trend. The extended transition state natural orbitals for chemical valence method shows that the &#960;&#8208;backdonation order is [B6X5]&#8722;&gt;[B10X9]&#8722;&gt;[B12X11]&#8722;. This predicted order explains the experimentally observed red shifts of the CO and N2 stretching fundamentals compared to those of the unbound molecules, as measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. The strongest red shift is observed for [B6Cl5N2]&#8722;: 222&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Therefore, strong activation of unreactive &#963;&#8208;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules (commonly observed for cationic transition metal complexes) is achieved with metal&#8208;free molecular anions.

         <title>Initial Quenching Efficiency Determines Light&#8208;Driven H2 Evolution of [Mo3S13]2&#8722; in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven H2 evolution at water&#8208;liposomes interfaces with molecular catalyst and photosensitizer is determined by the properties of the lipid bilayer. Initial light&#8208;driven charge transfer at room temperature depends upon the local lipid environment, with the highest efficiency at the transition temperature of the lipid bilayer.







Abstract
Nature uses reactive components embedded in biological membranes to perform light&#8208;driven photosynthesis. Here, a model artificial photosynthetic system for light&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution is reported. The system is based on liposomes where amphiphilic ruthenium trisbipyridine based photosensitizer (RuC9) and the H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalyst [Mo3S13]2&#8722; are embedded in biomimetic phospholipid membranes. When DMPC was used as the main lipid of these light&#8208;active liposomes, increased catalytic activity (TONCAT ~200) was observed compared to purely aqueous conditions. Although all tested lipid matrixes, including DMPC, DOPG, DPPC and DOPG liposomes provided similar liposomal structures according to TEM analysis, only DMPC yielded high H2 amounts. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements using Pd microsensors revealed an induction period of around 26 minutes prior to H2 evolution, indicating an activation mechanism which might be induced by the fluid&#8208;gel phase transition of DMPC at room temperature. Stern&#8208;Volmer&#8208;type quenching studies revealed that electron transfer dynamics from the excited state photosensitizer are most efficient in the DMPC lipid environment giving insight for design of artificial photosynthetic systems using lipid bilayer membranes.

         <title>A Methoxylation&#8208;Promoted CPET Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methoxylation reaction at the ligand backbone promoting a CPET reaction oxidizing central metal ion has been disclosed. Notably, the demethoxylation induced reduction has also been realized. Hither&#8208;to&#8208;unknown such reactions have been achieved on a cobalt(II) high spin complex containing a redox non&#8208;innocent 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone derivative.







Abstract
The manuscript discloses a methoxylation reaction to an aromatic carbonyl function that carries out a CPET reaction oxidizing a transition metal ion. Spontaneous methoxylation of a redox non&#8208;innocent fragment coordinated to a high spin cobalt(II) ion, promoted concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction oxidizing cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) in air and subsequent demethoxylation induced reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II) producing H2O2 are authenticated. The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is &#8722;0.27&#8197;V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple. However, in presence of MeOH the reduction potential decreases to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V due to CPET involving MeOH proton. In CH2Cl2/CHCl3 spontaneous demethoxylation occurs giving back the original complex and reactive methoxyl radical that reacts with O2 producing H2O2. Overall one molecule of MeOH produces one molecule of H2O2. To analyze the involvement of the proton, the rate constants of the CPET reactions in CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CH2Cl2&#8208;CD3OD (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and the demethoxylation reaction in CHCl3 at 330&#8197;K were determined by time drive UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.

Dimer contest: A combined matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic and theoretical study provides unprecedented insight into isolated dimers of two constitutional benzoacridine isomers and the differences to dimeric structures in the crystalline solid state.







Abstract
In this work, matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas&#8208;phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid&#8208;state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.

         <title>Charge Transfer in Be&#8722;Ru Compounds</title>

Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 are novel structural prototypes featuring an inhomogeneous 2D intergrowth of Fe2P&#8208; and U3Si2&#8208;type motifs. Chemical bonding analysis reveals the presence of polar multi&#8208;atomic bonds and charge transfer. Topological analysis of electron density in the Be&#8722;Ru compounds demonstrates non&#8208;linear change in the atomic volumina and complex variation of QTAIM atomic charges with composition.







Abstract
During the investigation of the binary system Be&#8722;Ru two new phases &#8211; Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 &#8211; with similar compositions (63.6 at. % Be and 63.2 at. % Be, respectively), are discovered. They both represent new structural prototypes. The phases are located between Be2Ru (Fe2P&#8208;type structure) and Be3Ru2 (U3Si2&#8208;type structure) in the phase diagram. This explains why their crystal structures, solved and refined from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data, are described as 2D intergrowth of Fe2P and U3Si2 motives. The calculated electronic density of stats (DOS) reveals pronounced minima in the vicinity of the Fermi level for both compounds. Position&#8208;space analysis of chemical bonding exhibits the formation of three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic polar bonds, involving both, Ru and Be, atoms, and a strong charge transfer from Be to the more electronegative Ru.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing Heteromerous Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes: Structural Effects on Thermodynamic Stability and Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) are compounds that exhibit various conformational isomers. In this study, heteromerous BAEs were synthesized by incorporating different tricyclic structures into a homomerous boron&#8208;containing BAE. The thermodynamic stability of the heteromerous BAEs could be modulated by the flexibility of the introduced structures. Additionally, photoreactivity was observed, resulting in the preparation of compounds with helicity.







Abstract
Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) have several conformations such as twisted and anti&#8208;folded conformers, and their stereochemistry and chromism have been studied in earnest. In this study, boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs having various tricyclic structures were synthesized and their photophysical properties investigated. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the introduction of a rigid fluorene unit resulted in a twisted conformer, whereas the introduction of flexible units such as thioxanthene and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene units resulted in an anti&#8208;folded conformer. The absorption spectra of the heteromerous BAEs were dependent on the introduced tricyclic structures, suggesting the immense impact of the tricyclic structures on the electronic structures of BAEs. DFT calculations revealed the large effect of the flexibility of the tricyclic structures on the thermodynamic stability of the conformers. In addition, the boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs underwent photocyclization reactions, indicating their potential application as precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and helical aromatic materials.

The unstable 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene is successfully studied via matrix isolation, employing its pyridine adduct as a precursor for sublimation. A photoinduced isomerization process leads to the formation of the unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct between the BN&#8208;aryne and dinitrogen. Introduction of tert&#8208;Bu groups on the other hand reduces reactivity, effectively preventing N2 fixation.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Azaborinines are the BN analogues of arynes through exchange of the formal CC triple bond by an isoelectronic BN bond. The BN&#8208;arynes are an underexplored class of reactive intermediates. Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine (10,9&#8208;BN&#8208;phenanthryne) 1 was inferred as reactive intermediate by trapping reactions. Here it is shown that 1 can be generated in the gas phase by thermolysis from the pyridine adduct of 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene by cleavage of the dative bond with pyridine and dinitrogen extrusion. The ionization potential of 1 is 8.2&#8197;eV with ionization resulting from the &#960; HOMO. Under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene photolysis results in isomerization to the dinitrogen adduct of 1 without involvement of a triplet borylnitrene intermediate. Photochemical nitrogen extrusion from 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N2 is not possible and nitrogen fixation is irreversible under cryogenic conditions. In contrast, 2,4,7,9&#8208;tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine can be photogenerated from the corresponding azidoborole precursor under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, and nitrogen fixation is precluded due to steric hindrance. The BN stretching vibration at about 1750&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is much weaker than in typical linear diaryl iminoboranes.

&lt;p&gt;The unstable 9-azido-9-borafluorene is successfully studied via matrix isolation, employing its pyridine adduct as a precursor for sublimation. A photoinduced isomerization process leads to the formation of the unique Lewis acid-base adduct between the BN-aryne and dinitrogen. Introduction of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-Bu groups on the other hand reduces reactivity, effectively preventing N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,2-Azaborinines are the BN analogues of arynes through exchange of the formal CC triple bond by an isoelectronic BN bond. The BN-arynes are an underexplored class of reactive intermediates. Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine (10,9-BN-phenanthryne) &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was inferred as reactive intermediate by trapping reactions.

         <title>An Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework Modified with Thioamide Groups for Selective Extraction of Palladium from Strong Acid Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust covalent organic framework (COF) functionalized with thioamide groups exhibits remarkable selectivity and high adsorption capacity for palladium from 4&#8197;M nitric acid, underscoring the highly promising potential of COFs for environmental remediation under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400&#8197;kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent reusability in 4&#8197;M nitric acid. Moreover, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.

         <title>A Prato Tour on Carbon Nanotubes: Raman Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using Prato reaction and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition has been studied. The results support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectroscopy are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing different reaction types.







Abstract
The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non&#8208;covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.

Carborane integrated immunoliposome was prepared by host exchanging reaction as a boron agent for BNCT.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising modality for cancer treatment because of its minimal invasiveness. To maximize the therapeutic benefits of BNCT, the development of efficient platforms for the delivery of boron agents is indispensable. Here, carborane&#8208;integrated immunoliposomes were prepared via an exchanging reaction to achieve HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted BNCT. The conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER&#8208;2 antibody to carborane&#8208;integrated liposomes successfully endowed these liposomes with targeting properties toward HER&#8208;2&#8208;overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells (SK&#8208;OV3); the resulting BNCT activity toward SK&#8208;OV3 cells obtained using the current immunoliposomal system was 14&#8208;fold that of the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex, which is a clinically available boron agent. Moreover, the growth of spheroids treated with this system followed by thermal neutron irradiation was significantly suppressed compared with treatment with the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex.

         <title>Rational Design of a Multifunctional Benzothiadiazole Derivative in Organic Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A careful rational design of a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was carried out. This compound was synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, that allows to increase the yields and reduce the reaction times. The desired compound showed multifunctional character with application in organic photonics as red optical waveguide and in organic electronics as p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8722;2&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8722;1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).

This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p-type semiconductor in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field-effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capture&#8208;SELEX of DNA Aptamers for Sulforhodamine B and Fluorescein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the capture&#8208;SELEX method, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex DNA aptamer for sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was isolated with a Kd of 1&#8197;&#956;M. Aptamer binding induced fluorescence enhancement of SRhB. Using fluorescein as a target, the same method yielded an aptamer with a much lower affinity, suggesting that structural features of target molecules are critical for aptamer binding.







Abstract
While many dye binding aptamers have been reported, most of them were for light&#8208;up aptamers that can significantly enhance the quantum yield of fluorophores. Sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was used as a target previously to select both DNA and RNA aptamers, and the DNA aptamer was a G&#8208;quadruplex that can bind to a number of rhodamine analogs. In addition, the previous selections were performed by immobilizing the target molecules. In this work, the library immobilization method was used to respectively select aptamers for SRhB and fluorescein. The SRhB aptamer has a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex structure with a Kd of 1.0&#8197;&#956;M measured from isothermal titration calorimetry. Upon titration of the aptamer, the fluorescence of SRhB increased 2.5&#8208;fold, and this aptamer does not require Mg2+ for binding. Rhodamine&#8197;B has even tighter binding suggesting binding through the xanthene moiety of the dyes. No binding was detected for fluorescein. For the fluorescein selection, a dominant aptamer sequence with a Kd of 147&#8197;&#956;M was obtained. This study provides two new aptamers for two important fluorophores that can be used to study aptamer&#8208;based separation, dye detection and catalysis. Comparison of these aptamers also provides insights into the effect of functional groups on aptamer binding.

         <title>Interrelations between Linkage Isomers of an Efficient Square&#8208;planar Nickel(II) Nitrite Photoswitch in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient square&#8208;planar nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch is reported and used as a model case to study the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization mechanism in the solid state. Based on combined experimental and theoretical studies the nitro&#8594;exo&#8208;nitrito&#8594;endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.







Abstract
An efficient nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch, with the 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyimino&#8208;3&#8208;[(2&#8217;&#8208;dimethylamino)ethyl]imino&#8208;1&#8208;propanone moiety used as the ancillary ligand, is reported. In the ground&#8208;state (&#8216;dark&#8217;) crystal structure, the studied compound exists predominantly as the nitro&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;N(O)2) isomer, however, traces of the exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;nitrito&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;ONO) forms are detected both at 100&#8197;K (4&#8211;5&#8201;% each) and under ambient conditions (~9&#8201;% each). When excited with the 405&#8211;530&#8197;nm LED light, the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization takes place. The total conversion exceeds 90&#8201;%. The exo&#8208;nitrito linkage isomer constitutes the dominant photo&#8208;generated form, whereas the relative population of both nitrito species depends on temperature. The reaction is fully reversible and reproducible. The photo&#8208;products are stable up to 200&#8197;K. The system constitutes a good model case for the reaction mechanism studies. Thus, experimental and theoretical investigations on the photo&#8208;isomerism were conducted and are presented in detail. Eventually, the nitro&#8594;exo&#8208;nitrito&#8594;endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Anchored and &#8208;Linked Bilayer Photocathode for Water Reduction</title>

NiO Substrate &amp; Co. A photocathode has been prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption and photochemical stability in aqueous solution and is applied in water reduction into hydrogen under irradiation in photo&#8208;electrochemical cells.







Abstract
The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photo&#8208;electrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and require the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts; they suffer from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Here, a compact bilayer photocathode has been prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved, with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible&#8208;light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few picoseconds. The integration of the organic photosensitizer with pyridine anchoring and linking groups is expected to provide a simple method for the fabrication of stable and efficient photocathodes.

Diaryl [5]helicene derivatives demonstrate well&#8208;defined reversible photocyclization reactions with turn&#8208;off mode fluorescent photoswitching behaviors upon photochromic reaction.

Abstract
Photoinduced tuning of aromaticity and correlative molecular properties has attracted enormous interest in recent years both for modulating photochromism properties and designing novel photochromic materials. Here, we report the synthesis and photochemical characterization of diaryl[5]helicene&#8208;based diarylethene molecular switches. 3,4&#8208;Bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 1&#8201;a showed no photochromic reaction, whereas 3,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 2&#8201;a and 3,4&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylthiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 3&#8201;a exhibited reversible photochromism in different aprotic solvents with specific light irradiation. Meanwhile, the diarylethene compounds 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a underwent turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitching together with photoisomerization upon light irradiation. Remarkably, the photoinduced changes in the aromaticity of [5]helicene as a central ethene bridge along with the relative smaller activation energy and higher frequency factor facilitated the thermal bleaching rates of diarylethene switches 2 and 3 in solution. This research provides new insight for designing aromatic diarylethene photoswitches for reversible fluorescence switching, photoinduced changes in aromaticity and further fast thermal back reactions.

Bartering a halide for two electrons: We describe the first halide&#8208;coupled double electron transfer reactions between a diborane and an organic substrate, leading to diborylated dienamines.







Abstract
The ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(&#956;&#8208;hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidinate) acts as a stable surrogate of the elusive dication [B2(hpp)2]2+, being both electrophilic (vacant boron p orbitals) and nucleophilic (filled B&#8722;B bond orbital). This combination of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane chemistry, with Lewis &#963;&#8208;basic and &#960;&#8208;acidic substrates being bound and reduced at the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction type within this general theme, in which double electron transfer from the diboron unit to the boron&#8211;bound organic substrate is coupled with halide transfer in the other direction. Novel diborylated dienamines are synthesized in this way. The scope of this unprecedented reaction motif and the reaction pathways are elucidated.

         <title>Nitrene C&#8722;H Bond Insertion Approach to Carbazolones and Indolones, and a Reactivity Departure for 7&#8208;Membered Analogues

2&#8208;Arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 2&#8208;arylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones can be converted in a facile 2&#8208;step, 1&#8208;pot manner to 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. These azides can be smoothly cyclized to carbazolones and indolones with catalytic Rh2(O2CC7H15)4. Although 3&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;phenylcyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one could be readily prepared from 2&#8208;phenylcycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, by contrast the Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization gave an azirine in preference to the indole. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
A modular platform for facile access to 1,2,3,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones (H4&#8208;carbazolones) and 3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones (H2&#8208;indolones) is described. The requisite 6&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered 2&#8208;arylcycloalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2&#8208;arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the ortho C&#8722;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H4&#8208;carbazolones and H2&#8208;indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of N&#8208;decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8722;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;kopsihainanine A. With 2&#8208;phenylcycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones in comparison to the 7&#8208;membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.

         <title>Transformation of Highly Hydrophobic Triarylphosphines into Amphiphiles via Staudinger Reaction with Hydrophilic Trichlorophenyl Azide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic triarylphosphines into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction with a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide is reported. The obtained amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr3) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr3 is still required. Herein, a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr3 into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction is reported. By simply mixing PAr3 and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.&#8201;e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05&#8197;mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60&#8197;h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron&#8208;withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.

&lt;p&gt;Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is still required. Herein, a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction is reported. By simply mixing PAr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.&#8201;e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide-based amphiphiles were remarkably water-soluble, enabling their spontaneous self-assembly into 2&#8197;nm-sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05&#8197;mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60&#8197;h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron-withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls into Chiral Conjugated Polycycles Incorporating Epoxycyclooctadiene: a Two&#8208;Step Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel approach to synthesize chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety, a key fragment found in the natural products. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on innovative reactions involving hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved through a concise two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles have garnered increasing attention due to versatile applications in optoelectronic materials and biological sciences. In this study, we report the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating a chiral epoxycyclooctadiene moiety. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on the novel reactions of hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved in two&#8208;step manner. Firstly, the TSS is regio&#8208;selectively transformed into its ortho&#8208;quinone form. Subsequently, the nucleophilic addition reactions of TSS ortho&#8208;quinone by phenylethynides are metal ion&#8208;dependent. When utilizing (phenylethynyl)magnesium bromide as the nucleophile, two phenylethynyls are furnished onto the edged benzene ring of TSS. When the nucleophile is (phenylethynyl)lithium, a cascade of nucleophilic addition, intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer, ring&#8208;opening, and tetradehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (TDDA) reactions occur sequentially in one&#8208;pot, ultimately affording chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles featuring the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety as an integral part of their backbones. This work represents a step forward in the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles using TSS as synthon.

         <dc:description>
The fully functionalized A&#8722;F ring system of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C suitable for coupling to the I&#8722;M fragment of the natural product, has been synthesized from a simple glucal derivative. A six&#8208;step sequence that features ring&#8208;closing metathesis and stereoselective palladium&#8208;mediated allylation has been deployed in an iterative manner to construct the medium&#8208;sized D and E rings.







Abstract
The fully functionalized A&#8722;F fragment of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C has been synthesized from a derivative of D&#8208;glucal, which serves as the B&#8208;ring. Rings A and C were introduced to either side of ring B by ring&#8208;closing diene and enyne metathesis (RCM). The seven&#8208;membered D&#8208;ring and eight&#8208;membered E&#8208;ring were assembled by iterative use of a six&#8208;step reaction sequence in which RCM was used for ring construction and Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation was employed for subsequent stereoselective functionalization. The nine&#8208;membered F&#8208;ring was formed by use of an RCM reaction and bears the functionality required for attachment of the I&#8722;M fragment and subsequent closure of rings G and H.

         <title>Anion Tuned Structural Modulation and Nonlinear Optical Effects of Metal&#8208;Ion Directed 310&#8208;Helix Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups was demonstrated in constructing diverse silver&#8208;coordinated networks. Further, the non&#8208;linear optical effects of these silver coordinated peptide networks was studied.







Abstract
Metals play an important role in the structure and functions of various proteins. The combination of metal ions and peptides have been emerging as an attractive field to create advanced structures and biomaterials. Here, we are reporting the anion&#8208;influenced, silver ion coordinated diverse networks of designed short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups. The short peptides adopted classical right&#8208;handed, left&#8208;handed and 310EL&#8208;helical conformations in the presence of different silver salts. The peptides have displayed conformational flexibility to accommodate different sizes and interactions of anions to yield a variety of metal&#8208;coordinated networks. The complexes of metal ions and peptides have shown different porous networks, right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical polymers, transformation of helix into superhelix and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 metal&#8208;peptide macrocycles. Further, the metal&#8208;peptide crystals with inherent dipoles of helical peptides gave striking second harmonic generation response. The optical energy upconversion from NIR to red and green light is demonstrated. Overall, we have shown the utilization of short 310&#8208;helices for the construction of diverse metal&#8208;coordinated helical networks and notable non&#8208;linear optical effects.

We report an efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. The sulfonyl carbamimidic azide cyclizes in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole, which can also be synthesized directly without isolating the sulfonyl carbamimidic azide.







Abstract
Herein, we report an operationally simple and efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. Initially, the carbamimidic azide is formed, which cyclizes only in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole in very good yields. The sulfonyl aminotetrazole can also be synthesized directly without isolating the carbamimidic azide in the presence of base. The sulfonyl azide is anticipated to generate nitrene and reacts with isocyanide to produce carbodiimide. Subsequent addition of azide (TMS&#8208;N3) to carbodiimide results in the formation of carbamimidic azide.

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, Electronic Ground State, and Electron Spin Relaxation of Seven Lanthanide Ions Bound to Lanmodulin and the Bioinspired Chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO)</title>

         <dc:description>
EPR spectroscopy has never been applied to small&#8208;molecule or protein complexes of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd3+. Here, the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions with the protein, lanmodulin, and the small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO), are investigated. The study shows differences in spectrum and relaxation properties that are dependent on both metal ion and coordination and motivates wider investigation of the EPR of lanthanides.







Abstract
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd3+, bound to small&#8208;molecule and protein chelators, are uncharacterized. Here, the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions bound to the natural lanthanide&#8208;binding protein, lanmodulin (LanM), and the synthetic small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO) (&#8220;HOPO&#8221;), were systematically investigated. Echo&#8208;detected pulsed EPR spectra reveal intense signals from ions for which the normal continuous&#8208;wave first&#8208;derivative spectra are negligibly different from zero. Spectra of Kramers lanthanide ions Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, and non&#8208;Kramers Tb3+ and Tm3+, bound to LanM are more similar to the ions in dilute aqueous:ethanol solution than to those coordinated with HOPO. Lanmodulins from two bacteria, with distinct metal&#8208;binding sites, had similar spectra for Tb3+ but different spectra for Nd3+. Spin echo dephasing rates (1/Tm) are faster for lanthanides than for most transition metals and limited detection of echoes to temperatures below ~6 to 12&#8197;K. Dephasing rates were environment dependent and decreased in the order water:ethanol&gt;LanM&gt;HOPO, which is attributed to decreasing librational motion. These results demonstrate that the EPR spectra and relaxation times of lanthanide(III) ions are sensitive to coordination environment, motivating wider application of these methods for characterization of both small&#8208;molecule and biomolecule interactions with lanthanides.

         <title>On the Number of &#960;&#8208;Electrons Involved in Stepwise Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All these electrons. Many recently disclosed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions utilize cycloaddends which are benzofused. Are the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the appended aromatic ring acting as &#8220;spectator electrons&#8221; in higher&#8208;order cycloadditions, or do they exert an influence on the reaction?







Abstract
The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher number of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.

         <title>Differentiating between Label and Protein Conformers in Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping on the straight and narrow: The dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif does not require a histidine&#8208;null background construct and enables label and protein conformers to be differentiated in pulsed dipolar EPR experiments. Here, we show that &#945;&#8208;helix 14 of YopO adopts only a straight conformation in the absence of actin.







Abstract
Pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site&#8208;directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via rather long and flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label copper(II)&#8208;nitrilotriacetic acid [Cu2+(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and yields narrow distance distributions, which can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71&#8197;kDa Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, that is, pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and relaxation&#8208;induced dipolar modulation enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif; this result suggests that the &#945;&#8208;helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA) label preferentially binds to the target double histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. Our results therefore suggest that the generation of a His&#8208;null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.

         <dc:description>
A special feature of the small metal&#8208;free electrophilic anion [B6X5]&#8722; is nitrogen activation through &#960;&#8208;backbonding. The &#960;&#8208;backbonding predicted by EDA ETS&#8208;NOCV and detected by IR spectroscopy as a red shift of the bound N2 vibrational frequency is shown as a cartoon &#8220;boxing match&#8221; between N2 (blue glove, &#963;&#8208;donation) and [B6Cl5]&#8208; (red gloves, &#960;&#8208;backdonation). The measured spectrum is shown on the outer surface of the boxing ring. Further information, including interaction with CO and H2O and comparison with [B12X11]&#8722;, can be found in the Research Article by J. Warneke and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302247).

         <title>Front Cover: Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogs of Aminocarboxylic Acids (Chem. Eur. J. 72/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its great potential for the synthesis of 1&#8208;chiral phosphonates, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) and deuteration (ATD) of 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates are poorly studied reactions. Like in a pinball machine, one can aim at a variety of different target structures and combine many different pathways in a robust and reliable way. The bonuses to be collected on this synthetic high&#8208;speed line towards 1&#8208;aminophosphonic acids include high enantiomeric excesses, yields and degrees of deuteration. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Pallitsch and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302171).

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we present a concise overview of recent breakthroughs in photochemical C&#8722;H methylation. These advancements encompass a variety of methodologies, including transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, and various metal&#8208;free approaches, such as electron donor&#8208;acceptor &#8208;enabled processes.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H, C(sp2)&#8722;H, and C(sp)&#8722;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether, TsOMe, N&#8208;(acetoxy)phthalimide, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8722;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.

         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 72, December 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a summary of strategies for achieving the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids. In many cases, the isolated enantiomers display unique chiroptical properties, features that reflect their extensive &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation pathways and unique metal complexation features. As a class, expanded porphyrinoids are expected to play a crucial role in the future production of chiral functional materials.







Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrinoids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrinoids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons&#160;Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets;&#160;a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2'&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5'&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicularitated on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8208;700 nm) with coefficient of 4.400 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02 min&#8208;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal, Solution, and Computational Study of the Structure of Ortho&#8208;Lithium N,N&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;P,P&#8208;Diphenylphosphinothioic Amide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first crystal structure of an ortho&#8208;lithium phosphinothioic amide complexed with tetramethylethylenediamine 12 is reported.

         <title>Water&#8208;soluble triazolium covalent cages for ATP sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble organic cages are attractive targets for their molecular recognition and sensing features of biologically relevant molecules. Here, we have successfully designed and synthesized a pair of water&#8208;soluble cationic cages employing click reaction as the fundamental step followed by the N&#8208;methylation of the triazole rings. The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent 3D hydrophobic cavity, positively charged surface, H&#8208;bonding triazolium rings, and excellent water solubility empower both cages to exhibit a superior affinity and selectivity for binding with adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) compared to cyclophanes and other macrocyclic receptors. Both cage molecules (PCC&#183;Cl and BCC&#183;Cl) can bind a highly emissive dye HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) to form non&#8208;fluorescent complexes. The addition of ATP resulted in the stronger cage&#204;ATP complexes with the retention of HPTS emission upon its displacement. The resultant indicator&#8208;displacement assay system can efficiently sense and quantify ATP in nanomolar detection limits in buffer solutions and human serum matrix. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of &#960;&#215;&#215;&#215;&#960; stacking interaction between the aromatic moiety of the cationic cages and the adenine moiety of ATP, as well as the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interaction between the phosphate anion of ATP and triazole protons of cages, played the pivotal roles in the sensing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(III) O^N^O Complexes as Water&#8208;tolerant and Environmentally Benign Catalysts for Polyurethane Foam Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyurethanes are synthesized on industrial scale by the reaction of diisocyanates with diols in the presence of catalysts which are commonly based on tin complexes and amines. However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III) complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable to hydrolysis as predicted by computations and observed experimentally. The O^N^O pincer scaffold is vital to the activity of these catalysts, simultaneously ensuring increased solubility in the reaction medium as well as providing a stable framework upon dissociation of co&#8208;ligands in the catalytic cycle. In silico mechanistic investigations for urethane formation show that the stabilization of active species in square&#8208;planar geometries enabled by these O^N^O ligands permit simultaneous coordination of alcohol and isocyanate in suitable configuration at the metal center.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Low Temperature Activity with Low N2O Emission of Stabilized Al&#8208;rich Zeolite Beta for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the use of liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment, Fe&#8208;containing beta zeolite catalysts show improved NOx conversions at low temperature regions and better hydrothermal stability while maintaining high selectivity due to the reorganization of Al framework. (FB: Fe&#8208;beta, &#8208;st: stabilized sample).







Abstract
The low temperature activity of Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites as selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) catalysts is a critical drawback for practical application. Here, we found unexpected improvement of low temperature activity by our proposed post&#8208;synthetic treatment. An Al&#8208;rich zeolite beta (Si/Al=5) is employed as the catalyst support, and the parent sample is dealuminated for higher hydrothermal stability, followed by the liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment and impregnation. It is found that stabilized samples feature excellent low temperature activity and high N2 selectivity even for a long&#8208;term operation, along with the ability to maintain high NOx conversion after aging. The improved SCR activity should be attributed to abundant acid sites in Al&#8208;rich framework and better stabilization of monomeric iron species after the stabilization treatment. Furthermore, the low yield of side product N2O is probably due to the absence of the generation of NH4NO3 during NH3&#8208;SCR catalyzed by Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites.

         <title>Aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization by Consecutive Paired Electrolysis: Dibromination of Aryl Amines with Dibromoethane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;pot bromination protocol for aryl amines has been developed under metal and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions employing constant current electrolysis at room temperature. The developed methodology uses electrically generated bromine from dibromoethane and carried out regioselective bromination of a wide range of aryl amines without the help of any additional activator.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a facile and efficient electrochemical method for the dibromination of aryl amines by double functionalization of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H (both para and ortho) under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions at room temperature for the first time. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to dibrominate a wide range of N&#8208;substituted aryl amines in a simple setup with C(+)/Pt(&#8722;) electrodes under mild reaction conditions. This transformation proceeds smoothly with a broad substrate scope affording the valuable and versatile N&#8208;substituted 2,4&#8208;dibromoanilines in moderate to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. In this paired electrolysis, cathodic reduction of 1,2&#8208;DBE followed by anodic oxidation generates bromonium intermediates, which then couple with anilines to furnish the dibrominated products. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The versatility of the electrochemical ortho&#8208;, para&#8208;dibromination was reflected by unique regioselectivities for challenging aryl amines and gram&#8208;scale electrosynthesis without the use of a stoichiometric oxidant or an activating agent.

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed to employ covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as nanocarriers to obtain 177Lu radiolabeled nanoparticles with reliable cancer theranositic functions. The effective tumor targeting and impressive antitumor efficacy of as&#8208;synthesized theranostic agents (177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs) were demonstrated by systematic in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo anticancer investigations: a) 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs were equipped with excellent capacity of bonding with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS); b) notable accumulation of 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs at tumor site in 4T1 tumor bearing model was revealed by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution; c) 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation (177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs) for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in&#8197;vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in&#8197;vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90&#8197;days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of 177Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.

&lt;p&gt;We proposed to employ covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as nanocarriers to obtain &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu radiolabeled nanoparticles with reliable cancer theranositic functions. The effective tumor targeting and impressive antitumor efficacy of as-synthesized theranostic agents (&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs) were demonstrated by systematic &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; anticancer investigations: a) &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs were equipped with excellent capacity of bonding with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS); b) notable accumulation of &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs at tumor site in 4T1 tumor bearing model was revealed by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution; c) 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 3&#8197;months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation (&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs) for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; anticancer investigations demonstrate that &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; biodistribution based on &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTA-PEG-CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90&#8197;days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anode Reaction Control for a Single&#8208;Compartment Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reactor with a Surface&#8208;Activated Diamond Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated anode reaction control for a membrane&#8208;free single&#8208;compartment carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) flow reactor with a boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrode. Fluorinated polymer coatings over an IrO2 electrode improved the selectivity of anode reactions. The use of a halogen free electrolyte and the activation of BDD cathode improved the CO2R reaction selectivity and achieved a Faradaic efficiency of formic acid of over 70&#8201;%.







Abstract
The electrochemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aqueous electrolyte solutions is attracting increasing attention for sustainable chemical production. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have been previously shown to be very effective for the stable electrochemical production of formic acid from CO2. Typically, the electrochemical production of formic acid by CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction is performed with a dual&#8208;compartment flow reactor equipped with a membrane separator. The problems caused by the membrane separator, such as scaling&#8208;up, complicated operational control and materials costs can be solved using a membrane free single&#8208;compartment reactor. Here we demonstrate anode reaction control for a single&#8208;compartment CO2R flow reactor using a surface&#8208;activated BDD cathode and achieve a Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production of over 70&#8201;%.

         <title>Neutral Chromium Complex with a Cr&#8801;Si Triple Bond: Synthesis and Photoinduced H&#8722;H and Benzene C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si bond was synthesized via dehydrogenation from a silylene complex with (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety. Its monomeric structure was revealed by XRD and DFT calculations. Irradiation of the chromium complex with H2 using LED light let to H2 activation to reproduce the (H)Cr=Si(H) complex. The chromium complex performed benzene C&#8722;H bond activation across the Cr&#8801;Si bond to afford 1,2&#8208;C&#8722;H addition product under irradiation.







Abstract
A neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si triple bond was prepared by dehydrogenation of a chromium silylene complex with Cr&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, and was isolated as monomeric crystals, unlike dimeric forms of its tungsten and molybdenum congeners. The strong Cr(&#948;&#8722;)&#8722;Si(&#948;+) bond polarity was revealed by the reaction with MeOH and DFT calculations. The chromium silylyne complex reacted with H2 under LED (365&#8197;nm) irradiation to reproduce the precursor silylene complex with a (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety, as a result of 1,2&#8208;H&#8722;H addition across the Cr&#8801;Si triple bond. Similarly, the chromium silylyne complex reacted with benzene under irradiation to afford an 1,2&#8208;addition product with a (H)Cr=Si(Ph) moiety, via benzene C&#8722;H bond activation accompanied by Si&#8722;C bond forming.

         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes, Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When benzoyl triflate was used as a catalyst on acyloxymethylcubane, a ring expansion of one carbon atom proceeded, resulting in the efficient production of acyloxymethylhomocubane. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane resulted in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. Similarly, 2&#8208;acyloxymethylcuneane can also be converted into acyloxycuneane. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol and homocuneanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;bis(acyloxymethl)cubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.

         <title>Annulation of a Methylenecyclopropane with Cyanoalkenes Catalyzed by Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare intermolecular annulation of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes with alkenes has been developed by using a methylenecyclopropane (MCP) and acyl cyanoalkenes to give dihydrofurans or furans. The dihydrofurans were synthesized in the presence of a catalytic amount of the base and were readily converted to the furans by using a stoichiometric amount of the base. A 1H&#8197;NMR study revealed that the ring&#8208;opened MCP reacts with the alkenes.







Abstract
The annulation of a methylenecyclopropane with acyl cyanoalkenes by using DABCO or quinuclidine as a catalyst to give 2,3&#8208;dihydofurans has been developed. A stoichiometric amount of the Lewis bases promoted the isomerization of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans to furans. 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of the reaction in&#8197;situ revealed that the methylenecyclopropane is opened by the Lewis base to form a reaction intermediate that is added to the cyanoalkenes.

A &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR study revealed that the ring-opened MCP reacts with the alkenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annulation of a methylenecyclopropane with acyl cyanoalkenes by using DABCO or quinuclidine as a catalyst to give 2,3-dihydofurans has been developed. A stoichiometric amount of the Lewis bases promoted the isomerization of 2,3-dihydrofurans to furans. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectra of the reaction in&#8197;situ revealed that the methylenecyclopropane is opened by the Lewis base to form a reaction intermediate that is added to the cyanoalkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Juggling Optoelectronics and Catalysis: The Dual Talents of Bench Stable 1,4&#8208;Azaborinines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench stable 1,4&#8208;azaborinine PAHs with an anthracene or ladder&#8208;type pentacene scaffold have been prepared, characterised and proven to be efficient catalysts for hydroboration of carbonyls and imines.







Abstract
Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs) have established a strong foothold in the realm of organic electronics. However, their catalytic potential remains largely untapped. In this study, we synthesise and characterise two bench stable B,N&#8208;doped PAH derivatives based on a 1,4&#8208;azaborinine motif. Most importantly, the anthracene derived structure is an efficient catalyst in the reduction of various carbonyls and imines. These results underscore the potential of B,N&#8208;PAHs in catalytic transformations, setting the stage for deeper exploration in this chemical space.

         <title>Conformer aggregates exhibit dual wavelength emissions on chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylenes and acetone detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene derivatives were synthesized, characterized by the distorted structures with local conjugation&#8208;induced rigidity, thus allowing excellent dual state emission. Upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, likely resulting in the dual wavelength emission peaks. Furthermore, acetone detection could be achieved in both aqueous and organic phases.







Abstract
The study on structure&#8208;property relationship has been a significant focus in the field of organic molecular luminescence. In the present work, three chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene (HTPE) derivatives were prepared through condensation reactions. Despite their similar structures, these compounds exhibited distinct luminescent properties. Diphenylmethane&#8208;derived HTPE displayed dual&#8208;state emissions, characterized by dual&#8208;wavelength emissions which were insensitive to the polarity of solvents. The dual emissions in solution state could be attributed to the different locally excited (LE) excitons. However, upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, probably leading to different emission peaks. In contrast, dibenzocycloheptadiene&#8208;derived HTPE aggregates showed only a single emission peak. Surprisingly, fluorene&#8208;derived HTPE exhibited obvious luminescence in neither solution nor aggregate states due to inherent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These conclusions were substantiated by X&#8208;ray analysis, spectroscopic analysis, and theory calculations. Application studies demonstrated that fluorescence on/off switches could be achieved through exposure to acetone. More importantly, trace amounts of acetone could be detected using luminescent materials in both organic and aqueous phases with a detection limit of 0.08&#8201;%. Thus, this work not only presents a strategy for designing chiral triphenylethylene fluorophores but also provides valuable information for dual wavelength emissions resulting from two stable conformations.

         <title>Post&#8208;device Dimethylamine Treatment Enables Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethylamine (DMA) is introduced as a post&#8208;treatment vapor to modify perovskite solar cells by a controlled low&#8208;dimensional perovskite formation process, thus reduce interface defects, hinder ion migration, provide a protective layer to inhibit invasion of water, suppress the escape of volatile ingredients. This DMA post&#8208;treatment enables the enhancement of both efficiency and stability of devices.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic ligands via post&#8208;device treatment is an effective strategy to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although the active area is protected by metal electrode under post&#8208;treatment, the aggression of post&#8208;treatment ligands into active area cannot be avoided thoroughly. Unfortunately, the size of long&#8208;chain amines is too large, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite cannot maintain its 3D perovskite structure once the cation substitution occurs during the post&#8208;treatment. Despite that the low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites are beneficial to stability, long&#8208;chain amines are harmful to carrier transport in PSCs. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA), a slightly oversized cation that can be doped into 3D perovskite structure, for post&#8208;device treatment to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. After exposure to DMA gas, the inactive area of Cs/FA/MA mixed cation perovskite device that is not covered by metal electrode is converted into LD perovskite, passivating the defects of 3D perovskite in the active region, suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination and ion migration. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.29&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis and better stability after DMA post&#8208;treatment, which is much higher than that (20.40&#8201;%) of the control device.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions such as coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and steric repulsion of substituents strongly affect the halogen&#8208;lithium exchange process. Here we present the manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums. The increase of the size of the &#8220;buttressing&#8221; substituent strongly affects the conformation of a NMe2 group, forcing it to hinder ortho&#8208;bromine and thus slowing down the exchange. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, this suppresses regioselectivity of the reaction. The &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; forces formed aryllithiums to deaggregate, thus boosting their reactivity. This facilitates the decomposition via protolisys by ethereal solvents even at low temperatures and in some cases initiates fast Wurtz&#8208;Fittig coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;state sensitive light&#8208;induced dynamics of Ruthenium&#8208;4H&#8208;Imidazole complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidized molecular states are key intermediates in photo&#8208;induced redox reactions, e.g., intermolecular charge transfer between photosensitizer and catalyst in photoredox catalysis. The stability and longevity of the oxidized photosensitizer is an important factor in optimizing the respective light&#8208;driven reaction pathways. In this work the oxidized states of Ruthenium(II)&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazole dyes are studied. The Ruthenium complexes constitute benchmark photosensitizers in solar energy interconversion processes with exceptional chemical stability, strong visible light absorption, and favourable redox properties. To rationalize the light&#8208;induced reaction in the oxidized Ruthenium(III) systems, we combine UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman, and transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) with time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Three complexes are compared, which vary with respect to their coordination environment, i.e., combining an 4H&#8208;imidazole with either 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 2,2';6'2"&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) coligands, and chloride or isothiocyanate ligands. While all oxidized complexes have similar steady state absorption properties, their excited state kinetics differ significantly; the study thus opens the doorway to study the light&#8208;driven reactivity of oxidized molecular intermediates in intermolecular charge transfer cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC &#183; BH2ER2 (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E = P, As; R2 = Me2, Ph2,tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC &#183; BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal ruthenium catalysts for selective quinaldine hydrogenation: Ligand and solvent effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal Ru nanoparticles (NP) display interesting catalytic properties for the hydrogenation of (hetero)arenes as they proceed efficiently in mild reaction conditions. In this work, a series of Ru based materials was used in order to selectively hydrogenate quinaldine and assess the impact of the stabilizing agent on their catalytic performances. Ru nanoparticles stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 1&#8208;adamantanecarboxylic acid (AdCOOH) allowed to obtain 6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinaldine with a remarkable selectivity in mild reaction conditions by choosing the suitable solvent. The presence of a carboxylate ligand on the surface of the Ru NP led to an increase in the activity when compared to Ru/PVP catalyst. The stabilizing agent had also an impact on the selectivity, as carboxylate ligand modified catalysts promoted the selectivity towards 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinaldine, with bulky carboxylate displaying the highest ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Cerium oxide catalyzed disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide: a closer look at the reaction intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have recently gained increasing interest as redox enzyme&#8208;mimetics to scavenge the intracellular excess of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Despite the extensive exploration, there remains a notable discrepancy regarding the interpretation of observed redshift of UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy due to H2O2 addition and the catalase&#8208;mimicking mechanism of CNPs. To address this question, we investigated the reaction mechanism by taking a closer look at the reaction intermediate during the catalase mimicking reaction. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that in aqueous solutions, H2O2 adsorption at CNP surface triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as cerium&#8208;peroxo (Ce&#8208;O22&#8208;) and/or cerium&#8208;hydroperoxo (Ce&#8208;OOH&#8208;) complexes as resolved by Raman scattering and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy. Polymer coating presents steric hinderance for H2O2 accessibility to the solid&#8208;liquid interface limiting further intermediate formation. We demonstrate in depth that the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the H2O2 disproportionation reaction increases with the Ce(III)&#8208;fraction and decreases in the presence of polymer coatings. The developed approach using UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy for the characterization of the surface peroxide species can potentially serve as a foundation for determining the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the disproportionation of H2O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical N&#8208;Aroylation of Sulfoximines by Using Benzoyl Hydrazines with H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developed here is an electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine with the evolution of N2 and H2 as innocuous by&#8208;products, which can be utilized as a clean energy source. This approach features mild, operational simplicity, and remarkable scope of complex and sensitive pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Developed here is a robust electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine via concomitant cleavage and formation of C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds with the evolution of H2 and N2 as innocuous by&#8208;products. This sustainable protocol avoids the use of toxic reagents and occurs at room temperature. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an aroyl and a sulfoximidoyl radical via anodic oxidation under constant current electrolysis (CCE), affording N&#8208;aroylated sulfoximine. The strategy is applied to late&#8208;stage sulfoximidation of L&#8208;menthol, (&#8722;)&#8208;borneol, D&#8208;glucose, vitamin&#8208;E derivatives, and marketed drugs such as probenecid, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ciprofibrate, and sulindac. In addition, the present methodology is mild, high functional group tolerance with broad substrate scope and scalable.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Special Synergy of Bimetallic Site in Co/MoC Catalyst to Promote N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced Co atom does not directly participate in binding with intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. DFT results reveal that by maintaining the good activity of N&#8722;N bond cleavage and the stability of intermediates on &#945;&#8208;MoC(0001) surface, the formation of NHx species is promoted by reducing the migration barrier of H atom after introducing Co atom.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanisms of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the pristine and Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) surfaces were explored by density functional theory calculations. The results show that the preferred pathway is that a direct N&#8801;N cleavage occurs first, followed by continuous hydrogenations. The production of second NH3 molecule is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step on both systems with kinetic barriers of 1.5 and 2.0&#8197;eV, respectively, indicating that N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation on bimetallic surface is more likely to occur. The two components of the bimetallic center play different roles during NRR process, in which Co atom does not directly participate in the binding of intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. This special synergy makes Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) have superior activity for ammonia synthesis. The introduction of Co not only facilitates N2 dissociation, but also accelerates the migration of H atom due to the antibonding characteristic of Co&#8722;H bond. This study offers a facile strategy for the rational design and development of efficient catalysts for ammonia synthesis and other reactions involving the hydrogenation processes.

         <title>A pseudo&#8208;Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Built upon Layered Double Hydroxides with Self&#8208;Strengthening Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) hydrogels, possessing a pseudo&#8208;double&#8208;network, have been constructed on the basis of dynamic covalent bonds, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The as&#8208;prepared nanocomposite hydrogels can retain more than 99&#8197;wt.% of water and exhibit a self&#8208;strengthening phenomenon, which originates from the inherent dynamic interactions, after mechanical training.







Abstract
While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross&#8208;linkers to construct self&#8208;strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8722;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8722;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8722;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9&#8197;wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90&#8201;% of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.

The as-prepared nanocomposite hydrogels can retain more than 99&#8197;wt.% of water and exhibit a self-strengthening phenomenon, which originates from the inherent dynamic interactions, after mechanical training.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross-linkers to construct self-strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non-covalent interactions within a &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt; double-network system. The &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt; first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris-modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8722;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non-covalent interactions between Tris&#8722;LDHs and poly(acrylamide-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-2-acrylamido-2-methyl&#8722;propanesulfonate) (&lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;(AM-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as-prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9&#8197;wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90&#8201;% of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self-strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non-covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Contemporary Applications of Thioamides and Methods for their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substitution of amide bonds with thioamides can have a beneficial influence on the stability of peptides towards proteolysis and affect folding among other effects. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for modification of peptides and natural products as well as new frontiers in the introduction of thioamide functionalities into proteins.







Abstract
Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of amide bonds in which the chalcogen atom of the carbonyl is changed from oxygen to sulfur. This substitution gives rise to altered nucleophilicity and hydrogen bonding properties with importance for both chemical reactivity and non&#8208;covalent interactions. As such, thioamides have been introduced into biologically active compounds to achieve improved target affinity and/or stability towards hydrolytic enzymes but have also been applied as probes of protein and peptide folding and dynamics. Recently, a series of new methods have been developed for the synthesis of thioamides as well as their utilization in peptide chemistry. Further, novel strategies for the incorporation of thioamides into proteins have been developed, enabling both structural and functional studies to be performed. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for peptide modification and study of protein function.

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of asymmetric amine ethers proceeds via efficient transesterification. Two tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfates are prepared in high yields and applied as intermediates of transesterification to synthesize asymmetric amine ethers, which has significant advantages over the conventional process.







Abstract
A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ethers is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.

         <title>Study on the epoxidation of chain olefins using biquaternary ammonium phosphotungstic acid phase transfer catalysts under no&#8208;solvent condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phase transfer catalyst comprising phosphotungstic acid and biquaternary ammonium cation salt is synthesized for the epoxidation of long carbon chain olefins under solvent&#8208;free conditions, which exhibits high selectivity for epoxides. Different methods are used to characterize the fundamental structure and catalytic mechanism of this catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we have developed a novel catalyst synthesized by phosphotungstic acid and a gemini quaternary ammonium cation salt. This quaternary ammonium salt not only reduces the interfacial tension between olefins and hydrogen peroxide but also forms a notably stable structure with phosphotungstic acid. Dodecene was successfully epoxidized to epoxy dodecane with a selectivity of 82.9&#8201;%. The impact of initial conditions was systematically investigated such as molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the catalytic performance. Characterization of the catalyst morphology was performed by SEM, TEM and SAXS. Raman spectra, FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra were employed to perform the catalyst transformation during the epoxidation reaction. This catalytic mechanism study could provide the industrial application in the epoxidation of long&#8208;chain olefins.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds in the Ebselen Class of Antioxidants&#160;Probed by X&#8208;ray Quantum Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic bonds are essential structural ingredients of dynamic covalent chemistry that involve reversible cleavage and formation of bonds. Herein, we explore the electronic characteristics of Se&#8722;N bonds in the organo&#8208;selenium antioxidant ebselen and its derivatives for their propensity to function as dynamic covalent bonds by employing high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography and complementary computational studies. An analysis of the experimentally reconstructed X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveals the salient electronic features of the Se&#8722;N bonds with very low electron density localized at the bonding region and a positive Laplacian value at the bond critical point. Bond orders and percentage covalency and ionicity estimated from the X&#8208;ray wavefunctions, along with localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses show that the Se&#8722;N bond is unique in its closed shell&#8208;like features, despite being a covalent bond. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations simulate the cleavage of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen in the excited state, further substantiating their nature as dynamic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral NHC Ligands for Enantioselective Gold(I) Catalysis Under Aerobic Conditions: the Importance of Conformational Flexibility and Steric Hindrance of NHC Ligand on Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I) catalysis has been recognized as a valuable tool for the unique transformation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Enantioselective &#960;&#8208;catalysis based on gold(I) complexes is, however, still underdeveloped due to lack of privileged ligands. Herein, we present an accessible method to a new family of stable yet catalytically active chiral NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;Cl complexes. The key to preserving a simultaneous fine balance between reactivity and stability in this newly developed family appears to be sterically hindered, but conformationally flexible NHC ligands. These could be easily accessed on a multigram scale by merging sterically hindered anilines with commercially available amino alcohols and amines via a four&#8208;steps synthetic sequence without the need for chromatographic purification. Further investigations of the catalytic activity of NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl complexes identified the OH functionality incorporated into the NHC core as crucial for the level of enantioselectivity as well as the TsO&#8208; anion responsible for the activation of NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;Cl. Finally, NMR studies and X&#8208;ray investigations revealed for the first time that the widely accepted ion metathesis (NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl to NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;OSO2R) responsible for the activation of NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl complexes does not take place (or it is very slow) in commonly used MeNO2 in contrast to DCM.</dc:description>

         <title>Template Assisted Formation of 32 and 34&#960; Octaphyrins Embedded with Dithienopyrrole Cores: A New Scaffold to Unravel Proton Coupled Redox Switching and (Anti)Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin is 32p antiaromatic and undergoes proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34p aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and F&#8208;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH&#8208;dependent bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pillar[5]arene as a protecting group. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization of a rotaxane building block is very efficient owing to steric effects limiting the access of the nucleophilic reagents to the second reactive carbonyl group. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes or axles in high yields.







Abstract
Detailed investigations into the stepwise bis&#8208;functionalization of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing rotaxane building block have been carried out. Upon a first stopper exchange, the pillar[5]arene moiety of the mono&#8208;acylated product is preferentially located close to its reactive pentafluorophenyl ester stopper, thus limiting the accessibility to the reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagents. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization is thus very efficient. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes with different amide stoppers. Moreover, when dethreading is possible upon the second acylation, the pillar[5]arene plays the role of a protecting group allowing the synthesis of dissymmetrical axles that are particularly difficult to prepare under statistical conditions. Finally, detailed conformation analysis of the rotaxanes revealed that the position of the pillar[5]arene moiety on its axle subunit is mainly governed by polar interactions in nonpolar organic solvents, whereas solvophobic effects play a major role in polar solvents.

         <title>A Nickel Anchored Covalent Organic Framework as Unimolecular Metallaphotocatalyst for Visible Light Driver C&#8722;P Bond Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;anchored COF (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) represents a unimolecular heterogeneous metallaphotocatalysis system, adept at efficient C&#8722;P bond construction. The synthesized photocatalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield. Furthermore, it exhibits a broad substrate scope and tolerance for various functional groups. Notably, this metallaphotocatalytic system has been found to process aryl bromides seamlessly, yielding products previously unreported in similar systems.







Abstract
The urgent need to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing organophosphine compounds is underscored by their extensive applications in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and photoelectric materials. Metalated covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which seamlessly integrate the inherent photo properties of COF with the catalytic capabilities of metal ions, offer an optimal material for efficient transformation of organics sustainably. In this study, we introduce a simple COF with nickel anchorages (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) as a unimolecular metallaphotocatalytic system for effective C&#8722;P bond formation. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving yields of up to 95&#8201;%, and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and functional group reactivity. Notably, the metallaphotocatalytic system has demonstrated the capability to process aryl bromides to produce the desired product, a feat not previously reported. Finally, the production and reusability test at the gram scale attests to its superior practicality for designing future organic cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Multielectron Redox Afforded by a Pincer Ligand Promoting Kumada Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalysed sp2&#8208;sp2 cross&#8208;coupling, that involves redox non&#8208;innocence of a NNN pincer ligand backbone is described.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;active nature of a pincer has been exploited to conduct C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions. A nickel complex with a NNN pincer was dimeric in the solid state, and the structure displayed a Ni2N2 diamond core. In the dimeric structure, both ligand backbones house an electron, in the iminosemiquinonate form, to keep the metal's oxidation state at +2. In the presence of an aryl Grignard reagent, only 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading the nickel complex generates a Kumada cross&#8208;coupled product in good yield from a wide variety of aryl&#8208;X (X= I, Br, Cl) substrates. That the ligand&#8208;based radical remains responsible for promoting such a coupling reaction following a radical pathway is suggested by TEMPO quenching. Furthermore, a radical&#8208;clock experiment along with tracing product distribution unambiguously supported the radical's involvement through the catalytic cycle. A series of thorough mechanistic probation, including computational DFT analysis, disclosed the cooperative action of both redox&#8208;active pincer ligand and the metal centre to drive the reaction.

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst with a dynamic configuration has been successfully synthesized and subsequently resolved. Both experimental and DFT studies show that the stereogenic rhodium center preserves its chiral information. Furthermore, the resolved complex provides enantiomeric ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the catalytic Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. These findings highlight its immense potential in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The unique dynamic configuration of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;Stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydrogenation of primary and secondary silanes and germanes via a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative process affords base&#8208;stabilized silylene and germylene complexes that can serve as synthons of free &#8220;:ER2&#8221; (E=Si, Ge).







Abstract
Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L=&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217;=2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8722;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes=mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tetrylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E=Si: R=Mes, H, 2; R=Et, 5; E=Ge: R=Ph, 6; R=tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E=Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing :ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.

         <title>Controlling pH&#8208;Sensitive Chemical Reactions Pathways with Light &#8208; a Tale of Two Photobases: an Arrhenius and a Br&#248;nsted</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interplay between two photobases, a hydroxide&#8208;releasing Arrhenius&#8208;type and a proton&#8208;accepting Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type, can result in a reversible change of pH upon tandem irradiation at two wavelengths. This system can control the direction of chemical reactions. In this study, the reaction direction of Alizarin Red S can be controlled in this manner.







Abstract
Light&#8208;gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH&#8208;sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light&#8208;triggered and reversible pH control. We show an application of this method in directing the pH&#8208;dependent reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S simply by switching between different wavelengths of light, i.&#8201;e., irradiating each photobase separately. The concept of a light&#8208;controlled system shown here of a sophisticated interplay between two photobases can be integrated into various smart functional and dynamic systems.

         <title>Autocatalysis in Eschenmoser Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piecing the puzzle together. Mass spectrometry reveals the autocatalytic behavior of the Eschenmoser coupling reaction. Combining the results from ESI&#8208;MS coupled with various add&#8208;on methods, such as IR spectroscopy, ion mobility, or flow chemistry, leads to a comprehensive view of the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The Eschenmoser coupling reaction (ECR) of thioamides with electrophiles is believed to proceed via thiirane intermediates. However, little is known about converting the intermediates into ECR products. Previous mechanistic studies involved external thiophiles to remove the sulfur atom from the intermediates. In this work, an ECR proceeding without any thiophilic agent or base is studied by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry. ESI&#8208;MS enables the detection of the so&#8208;far elusive polysulfide species Sn, with n ranging from 2 to 16 sulfur atoms, proposed to be the key species leading to product formation. Integrating observations from ion mobility spectrometry, ion spectroscopy, and reaction monitoring via flow chemistry coupled with mass spectrometry provides a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and uncovers the autocatalytic nature of the ECR reaction.

The reaction of isocyanates and oximes undergoes N&#8208;selective carbamoylation, directly generating nitrones. Sequential reactions with dipolarophiles give isoxazolidines. The combination of the three components provides diversity in the yields of isoxazolidines.







Abstract
N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94&#8201;%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>gamma&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of g&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric g&#8208;CD such as a g&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous g&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a g&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three-component aza-Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of g-cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N-phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric g-CD such as a g-cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge-like macroporous g-cyclodextrin-based cryogel (GCDC), and a g-cyclodextrin-based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco-friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances&#160;in&#160;the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi&#160;Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidomimetics&#160;have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve&#160;pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles&#160;could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many&#160;efforts have been made to synthesize various&#160;peptidomimetics. Among them,&#160;the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of&#160;the&#160;condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear&#160;peptidomimetic. In order to&#160;obtain&#160;other&#160;linear,&#160;cyclic or polycyclic&#160;peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations.&#160;This review covers the years from 2018&#8208;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually&#160;followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions,&#160;and metal&#8208;free reactions&#160;toward peptidomimetics&#160;are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the potential of carbon dots as a fluorescent probe in the determination of heavy ions and as an electrochemical biosensor. It also discusses how carbon dots can be introduced into the Fricke solution to potentially serve as an ionizing radiation sensor. The study presents a novel tissue equivalent dosimeter carbon dots&#8208;based as an ionizing radiation sensor. The methodology for the synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon Dots N&#8208;CDs and the characterization of the material are described. The results show that the N&#8208;CDs have a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and can be used as a dosimeter for radiation detection. The study also discusses the limitations and challenges of using carbon dots as a dosimeter for ionizing radiation. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of carbon dots in different fields and highlights the importance of further research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Determination of Organic Cages by Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size matters: In a systematic study, a series of organic cages was synthesized, and their molecular size and mass were determined by diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). Specific effects of window size and rigid exohedral functionalization revealed insight into structure&#8208;diffusion relationships, which could be transferred to literature&#8208;known cages and aid for the precise structure elucidation and property prediction of future cages.







Abstract
Reliable structure elucidation of covalent organic cage compounds remains challenging as routine analysis might leave ambiguities. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows insight into the molecular size and mass of the species present in solution, but a systematic evaluation of the diffusion behavior for cage assemblies is rarely considered. Here we report the synthesis of four series of covalent organic cages based on tribenzotriquinacenes and diboronic acids with varying geometry and exohedral substituents. We provide a guideline for the consistent measurement of diffusion coefficients from 1H&#8208;DOSY&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, which was utilized to study the diffusion behavior for the whole set of cages and selected examples from the literature. For structurally similar cages, a linear correlation between the solvodynamic volume and the molecular mass allows precise size determination. For more complex systems, multiple parameters, such as window size or rigid exohedral functionalization. further modulate cage diffusion in solution.

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2 Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes based on MACHO ligand scaffolds produce in their activated amido form stable CO2 adducts, which comprise a 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;O} metallacyclic core. The CO2 adducts generally exhibit a reactivity tamed down as compared to the parent complexes. As masked forms of the catalytically competent amido species, these adducts may have important implications as off&#8208;loop species in carbon dioxide conversion.







Abstract
Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2 to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R=isopropyl&gt;adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.

         <title>Unlocking same&#8208;sign CPL: solvent effects on spectral form and racemisation kinetics in nine&#8208;coordinate chiral europium(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the importance and role of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) transitions in their emission profile. It is key to investigate the effect of these fundamental physical and environmental factors on the shape, sign and magnitude of CPL active luminescent transitions. Increased understanding of this could lead to novel, bright europium(III) complexes with monosignate individual CPL transitions to be designed for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Understanding the factors that shape the circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) emission profiles of europium(III)&#8208;based CPL emitters to have specific sign properties, e.&#8201;g. monosignate individual CPL transitions, is key to design novel complexes for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging. In order to correlate structure and spectral characteristics, a photophysical and kinetic investigation has been conducted on a series of coordinatively saturated nine&#8208;coordinate europium(III) systems based on 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane. We highlight that lanthanide emission is sensitive to changes in the ligand field by showing the linear dependence of total emission intensity ratios as a function of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying an internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state. This sensitivity increases by a factor of 20 when studying changes in CPL spectra, rendering these complexes accurate probes of local polarity. Solvent polarity, solvent&#8208;specific effects, and the nature of the chromophores&#8217; coordinating donor atoms strongly influence the kinetic stability of europium(III) complexes with respect to enantiomer interconversion. Notably, we show that the choice of donor groups to coordinating to europium(III) and the nature and polarity of the solvent affects the rate of racemisation, leading to systems with very long half&#8208;lives at room temperature in non&#8208;polar media.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Electron Fluctuation&#8208;Induced P+/C&#8722; Ambiphilic Interaction for Intramolecular CAr&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected C&#8722;H bond activation promoted us to re&#8208;visit the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole, and further theoretical studies led to finding that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of a transient P+/C&#8722; ambiphilic species, which responsible for the C&#8722;H bond activation. This work provides mechanistic insights into the previously reported regioselective [4+2] cycloadditions with 2H&#8208;phosphindoles also.







Abstract
Herein, we describe how computational mechanistic understanding has led directly to the discovery of new 2H&#8208;phosphindole for C&#8722;CAr bond activation and dearomatization reaction. We uncover an unexpected intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation with a 2H&#8208;phosphindole derivative. This new intriguing experimental observation and further theoretical studies led to an extension of the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole. Through DFT calculations, we confirm that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of an electrophilic phosphorus atom (P+) and a nucleophilic carbon atom (C&#8722;). This kinetically accessible ambiphilic phosphorus/carbon couple is spatially separated by geometric constraints, and their reactivity is modulated through structural resonance.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Silylated Vinylboronates by a Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction and Their Application to Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrasubstituted silylated pinacol vinylboronates and trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates was synthesized by using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. By using this protocol, the boryl and the silyl groups can be directly and highly stereoselectively incorporated into the olefin&#8216;s anti&#8208;position. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling of the silylated vinyl boronates allows access to several all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, anticancer drug Tamoxifen, and AIEgen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.







Abstract
The highly stereoselective synthesis of a series of tetrasubstituted mono&#8208; as well as disilylated vinylboronates is reported by using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. The condensation between acylsilanes and gem&#8208;diborylalkanes gave the desired tetrasubstituted olefins in good to excellent yield and high stereoselectivity. Also, a series of trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates was synthesized by using the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction followed by a transesterification reaction. This methodology allows direct incorporation of B(pin) and TMS groups in the anti&#8208;position of the olefin in a highly stereoselective manner. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling reaction with the silylated vinyl boronic esters generated all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, which have been applied in the total synthesis of the anticancer drug Tamoxifen and aggregation&#8208;induced luminogen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.

         <title>trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes as Scavengers of Bromine Involved in Catalytic Bromination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group was developed to retard non&#8208;catalyzed reactions in bromination using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide by capturing in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated bromine (Br2), which was revealed to cause background reactions. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity and as a probe to investigate the involvement of Br2 in catalytic bromination.







Abstract
Scavengers that capture reactive chemical substances are used to prevent the decomposition of materials. However, in the field of catalysis, the development of scavengers that inhibit background pathways has attracted little attention, although the concept will open up an otherwise inaccessible reaction space. In catalytic bromination, fast non&#8208;catalyzed background reactions disturb the catalytic control of the selectivity, even when using N&#8208;bromoamide reagents, which have a milder reactivity than bromine (Br2). Here, we developed a trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group to efficiently retard background reactions by capturing Br2 in bromocyclization using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. The use of less than a stoichiometric amount of the TCO was sufficient to inhibit non&#8208;catalyzed reactions, and mechanistic studies using the TCO revealed that in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Br2 provides non&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathways based on a chain mechanism. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving enantioselectivity and regioselectivity in catalytic reactions. Cooperative systems using the TCO with selective catalysts offer an alternative strategy for optimizing catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity during bromination. Moreover, it also served as an indicator of Br2 involved in catalytic reaction pathways; thus, the TCO was useful as a probe for mechanistic investigations into the involvement of Br2 in bromination reactions of interest.

         <title>Organometallic Bridge Diversification of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20 hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Hierarchically Porous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous crystalline materials. The pores in HOFs are usually non&#8208;covalent extrinsic pores constructed through the formation of the framework. Supramolecular macrocycles with intrinsic pores in their structures are good candidates for constructing HOFs with intrinsic pores from the macrocycles themselves, thus leading to hierarchically porous structures. Combining the macrocycle and HOFs will endow these hierarchically porous materials with enhanced properties and special functionalities. This review summarizes recent advances in macrocycle&#8208;based HOFs, including the macrocycles used for constructing HOFs, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically HOFs porous structures. This review provides insights for future research on macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous HOFs and the appropriate applications of the unique structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of&#160;Oligorotaxanes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide&#160;Macrocycles through Threaded Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and selective organic synthetic approaches for complex molecules has garnered significant attention due to the need for precise control over molecular structures and functions. Rotaxanes, a type of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have shown promising applications in various fields including sensing, catalysis, and material science. However, the highly selective synthesis of oligo[n]rotaxanes (mostly n &#8805; 3) through controlling host&#8208;guest complexation and supramolecular threading assembly process still remains an ongoing challenge. In particular, the utilization of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) macrocycles with structural shape&#8208;persistency for the synthesis of oligo[n]rotaxanes is rare. In this concept, research on cooperatively threaded host&#8208;guest complexation with hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and selective synthetic protocols of oligo[n]rotaxanes has been summarized. The high efficiency and selectivity in synthesis are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of macrocycles within the unique supramolecular structure of threaded host&#8208;guest complexes and rotaxanes. This review focuses on the latest progress in the concepts, synthesis, and properties of H&#8208;bonded aramide macrocycle&#8208;based oligorotaxanes, and presents an in&#8208;depth outlook on challenges in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Four Ring Units&#8208;Containing Zeolites: Synthesis, Structural Modification and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In zeolite frameworks, double four&#8208;ring (d4r) configurations are among the most frequent composite building units. The composition variations in d4r units greatly influence the energy and structural modifiability of the zeolitic framework. The introduction of germanium, with a larger ionic radius than silicon or aluminum, not only reduces the energy constraints of d4r in the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolites, but also opens a new window for constructing novel crystalline structures, especially with large or extra&#8208;large pores and channels. Ge&#8208;enriched d4r units endow germanosilicates with structure diversity readily for post treatments. Promising catalytic materials have been gradually developed and increasingly studied by direct synthesis or post&#8208;synthetic isomorphous substitution for Ge. This review focuses on the recent progress in the synthesis, modification, and catalytic application of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites, including germanosilicates, aluminosilicates, and silicates.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Star&#8208;shaped meso&#8208;substituted Fluorescent Porphyrins with Fluorenyl&#8208;containing Arms Designed for Two&#8208;photon Oxygen Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: In the continuation of previous studies on carbon&#8208;rich meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins featuring 2,7&#8208;fluorene units at their periphery, the effect of changing the peripheral dendritic arms for linear arms on . their oxygen&#8208;photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties is now analyzed. Thus, starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units were isolated and studied. More precisely, a series of five new free&#8208;base porphyrins featuring fully conjugated arms incorporating an increasing number of fluorenyl groups connected via 1,2&#8208;alkenyl spacers were synthesized, along with their Zn(II) complexes. Upon excitation in the arm&#8208;centred&#160;band, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the peripheral fluorenyl units to the central porphyrin core, leading to intense red&#8208;light emission and oxygen photosensitization by the latter. More interestingly, while the linear optical properties of these porphyrins were only slightly improved compared to those of their dendrimer analogues for photodynamic therapy (PDT) or fluorescence imaging, their 2PA cross&#8208;sections were much more significantly boosted, evidencing the key role played by different structures on nonlinear optical properties. Finally, by comparison with other porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;photon photosensitizers reported in the literature, we show that these new &#8220;semi&#8208;disconnected&#8221; starburst systems exhibit a remarkable trade&#8208;off between intrinsic 2PA, fluorescence and oxygen photosensitization.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution at Phosphorus Centres &#8211; Old and Recent Studies and a Final Solution of Mechanistic and Related Stereochemical Problems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among many problems of a fundamental value in the heteroatom chemistry the mechanism and stereochemistry of nucleophilic substitution reaction at the phosphorus and other heteroatom centres have attracted a great attention of phosphorus chemists already in the middle of the last century. This review, which does not have a comprehensive character, summarizes the selected original contributions aimed at solution of the mechanism of SN2&#8208;P reaction and its relationship with stereochemistry. The breakthrough in these studies has the Westheimer concept and his rules presented at the beginning of this article. Next, a series of papers is presented where the stereochemistry of substitution at phosphorus was investigated in cyclic five&#8208;, four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring phosphorus compound. The majority of these reactions have been found to occur with retention of the P&#8208;configuration. In the third part of this account, the selected examples of substitution reactions at phosphorus in acyclic compounds are discussed. As the results of all the investigations discussed did not allow to ascribe undoubtedly the mechanism (SN2 or A&#8208;E) to the investigated reactions, in the last part the SN&#8208;P reactions are presented the mechanism of which has been established by combination of the stereochemical and DFT&#8208;studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe and Cu Intercalations Enhance SERS of MoO3 through Different Mechanistic Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a molecular&#8208;specific analytical technique with various applications. Although electromagnetic (EM) and chemical (CM) mechanisms have been proposed to be the main origins of SERS, exploring highly sensitive SERS substrates with well&#8208;defined mechanistic pathways remains challenging. Since surface and electronic structures of substrates were crucial for SERS activity, zero&#8208;valent transition metals (Fe and Cu) were intercalated into MoO3 to modulate its surface and electronic structures, leading to unexceptional high enhancement factors (1.0 &#215; 10^8 and 1.1 &#215; 10^10 for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3, respectively) with decent reproducibility and stability. Interestingly, different mechanistic pathways (CM and EM) were proposed for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 according to mechanistic investigations.

Although electromagnetic (EM) and chemical (CM) mechanisms have been proposed to be the main origins of SERS, exploring highly sensitive SERS substrates with well-defined mechanistic pathways remains challenging. Since surface and electronic structures of substrates were crucial for SERS activity, zero-valent transition metals (Fe and Cu) were intercalated into MoO3 to modulate its surface and electronic structures, leading to unexceptional high enhancement factors (1.0 &#215; 10^8 and 1.1 &#215; 10^10 for Fe-MoO3 and Cu-MoO3, respectively) with decent reproducibility and stability. Interestingly, different mechanistic pathways (CM and EM) were proposed for Fe-MoO3 and Cu-MoO3 according to mechanistic investigations. The distinct mechanistic pathways were further rationalized by the electronic structures of the intercalated Fe(0) and Cu(0), which modulates the surface and electronic structures of Fe-MoO3 and Cu-MoO3 to differentiate their mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Selective cleavage of unstrained (sp3) C&#8208;C/ C&#8208;N bonds under mild conditions is highly challenging due to the higher bond dissociation energy. A visible light mediated metal free oxidative dehomologation of aryl acetonitriles, primary alcohols and diols to carboxylic acids via organophotocatalysed C(sp3)&#8208;CN, C(sp3)&#8208;C(OH) bond cleavage is reported. Notably, this methodology was further extended towards selective synthesis of aldehydes via deamination of both primary as well as secondary amines. This mild protocol features wide array of substrate variation with excellent functional group tolerance, preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, and operational simplicity. Possible mechanisms for these transformations were demonstrated through a series of control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Fluorescence in Both Solution and Solid States Induced by Imine Cage Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing luminescent materials that exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid phases is highly desirable and challenging. Herein, we report imine&#8208;bond directed formation of a rigid organic cage (TPE&#8208;cage) that was synthesized by [2 +4] imine condensation of a TPE&#8208;cored tetra&#8208;aldehyde (TPE&#8208;TA) with a clip&#8208;like diamine (XA) to illustrate confinement&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement. Compared to the non&#8208;emissive TPE&#8208;TA (&#632;F = 0.26%) in the dichloromethane (DCM) solution, the TPE&#8208;cage achieved a remarkable (~520&#8208;fold) emission enhancement (&#632;F = 70.38%). In contrast, a monomeric tetra&#8208;imine model compound (TPE&#8208;model) showed only a minor enhancement (&#632;F = 0.56%) in emission compared to the parent tetra&#8208;aldehyde TPE&#8208;TA. The emission of TPE&#8208;cage was further enhanced by ~1.5&#8208;fold (&#632;F = 80.96%) in the aggregated state owing to aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE). This approach establishes the potential for synthesizing luminescent materials with high emission in both solution and solid&#8208;state by employing a single&#8208;step imine condensation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Short&#8208;Process Regeneration of Highly Stable Spherical LiCoO2 Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Carbonate Precipitation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficacy recycling of spent lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) batteries is one of the key tasks in realizing a global resource security strategy due to the rareness of lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co) resources. However, it is of great significance to develop the innovative recycle methods for spent LiCoO2, simultaneously realizing the efficient recovery of valuable elements and the regeneration of high&#8208;performance LiCoO2. Herein, a novel strategy of regenerating LiCoO2 cathode is proposed, which involves the preparation of micro&#8208;spherical aluminum (Al)&#8208;doped lithium&#8208;lacked precursor (Li2xCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yAl2/3yCO3, remarked as &#8220;PLCAC&#8221;) via ammonium bicarbonate coprecipitation. The comprehensive conditions affecting particle growth kinetics, morphology and particle size the has been investigated in detail by physical characterizations and electrochemical measurements. And the optimized Al&#8208;doped LiCoO2 materials with high&#8208;density sphericity (LiCo1 &#8208;yAl2/3yO2, remarked as &#8220;LCAO&#8221;) shows a high initial specific capacity of 161 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C and excellent capacity retention of 99.5% within 100 cycles at 1 C in the voltage range of 2.8 to 4.3 V. Our work provides valuable insights into the featured design of LiCoO2 precursors and cathode materials from spent LiCoO2 batteries, potentially guaranteeing the high&#8208;efficacy recycling and utilization of strategic resources.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylimidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted Nitronyl Nitroxides and Their Mononuclear Cu(II) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel synthetic approach has been employed to synthesize a series of new nitronyl nitroxides: 2&#8209;(1&#8208;propyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208; (Ln&#8208;Pr), 2&#8208;(1&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208; (Li&#8208;Pr) and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;oxide&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (Ln&#8208;Bu). The reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with LR in a 1:2 ratio yields mononuclear heterospin complexes [Cu(hfac)2(LR)2] (LR=&#160;Ln&#8209;Pr, Li&#8209;Pr, Ln&#8208;Bu), which have a similar crystal structure to the &#8220;jumping&#8221; crystals [Cu(hfac)2(LMe)2] that exhibit chemomechanical activity. It was shown that an increase in the alkyl substituent R leads to changes in the crystal packing of the molecules and the absence of chemomechanical activity. Furthermore, it was found that two polymorph modifications of the heterospin complex [Cu(hfac)2(Ln&#8208;Pr)2] can be obtained, and magnetic properties of [Cu(hfac)2(Ln&#8208;Pr)2] strongly depend on the angle between the planes of the paramagnetic fragment O&#8212;N&#8208;C=N&#8594;O and the imidazole ring in Ln&#8208;Pr.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Safe and high&#8208;performance secondary batteries using for all&#8208;climate conditions with different temperatures are highly required. Here, we develop a three&#8208;dimensional ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode material for magnesium&#8208;ion (Mg&#8208;ion) batteries. After cycling 300 times, the capacity maintains 111.7 mAh g&#8208;1, while Coulombic efficiency stabilizes at about 100%. Under temperatures of 45 &#176;C and &#8210;5 &#176;C, the capacities remain stable after 200 cycles. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance tests, the capacity keeps quite stable. It is ascribed to the ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion, which has been verified by constant&#8208;current intermittent titration technology. It is believed that the good performance enables the Mg&#8208;ion batteries to have a all&#8208;climate capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Unmasking the Electrochemical Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers on Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers are transforming electrocatalysis and biosensor design via their increased performance and stability. Despite their increasing use in electrochemical systems, the integrity of the NHC monolayer during voltage perturbations remains largely unknown. Herein, we deploy surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to measure the stability of two model NHCs on gold in ambient conditions as a function of applied potential and under continuous voltammetric interrogation. Our results illustrate that NHC monolayers exhibit electrochemical stability over a wide voltage window (&#8208;1 V to 0.5 V vs Ag|AgCl), but they are found to degrade at strongly reducing (&lt; &#8208;1 V) or oxidizing (&gt; 0.5V) potentials. We also address NHC monolayer stability under continuous voltammetric interrogation between 0.2 V and &#8208;0.5 V, a commonly used voltage window for sensing, showing they are stable for up to 43 hours. However, we additionally find that modifications of the backbone NHC structure can lead to significantly shorter operational lifetimes. While these results highlight the potential of NHC architectures for electrode functionalization, they also reveal potential pitfalls that have not been fully appreciated in electrochemical applications of NHCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Starfruit&#8208;shaped&#160;Zirconium Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks: From 3D intermediates to 2D Nanosheet Petals with Enhanced Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the fabrication of a novel starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and Tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers. The SMOF exhibits a unique morphology with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals. Our investigation unravels a captivating transformation process, wherein three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shuttle&#8208;shaped MOFs form initially and subsequently evolve into 2D nanosheet&#8208;based SMOF structures. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. This discovery of the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transition growth pathway unlocks exciting opportunities for exploring novel strategies in advanced MOF nanostructure development, not only for catalysis but also for various other applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in cells and living systems has equipped scientists with a toolbox to study biological processes and release drugs on demand. Thus far, an impressive scope of reactions has been performed in these settings, but many are yet to be introduced. Nitrene transfer presents a rather unexplored new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The reaction products are frequently encountered motifs in pharmaceuticals, presenting opportunities for the controlled, intracellular synthesis of drugs. Hence, we explored the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation reaction in water for future in vivo application. Two Cu(I) complexes containing trispyrazolylborate ligands (Tpx) were selected, and the catalytic system was evaluated with the aid of three fitness factors. The excellent nitrene transfer reactivity and high chemoselectivity of the catalysts, coupled with good biomolecule compatibility, successfully enabled the sulfimidation of thioethers in aqueous media. We envision that this copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfimidation reaction could be an interesting starting point to unlock the potential of nitrene transfer catalysis in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Substitution Regulates High Temperature Dielectric Switch in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a pair of 1D lead&#8208;free hybrid metal halides: (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP=3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2) exhibit high temperature triggered structural phase transition and dielectric switching properties. By halogen substitution in the inorganic framework, the dielectric switch temperature of 2 increased about 20&#8197;K, compared with 1.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) based phase transition materials have received widespread attention due to their excellent performance and potential applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, ferroics, and actuators. Nevertheless, effectively regulating the properties of phase transitions is still a thorny problem. In this work, two chiral lead&#8208;free HMHs (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP=3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2) were synthesized. By replacing the halide ions in the inorganic skeleton, the phase transition temperature of 2 changes with an increase of about 20&#8197;K, compared with 1. Meanwhile, both compounds display reversible dielectric switching properties. Through crystal structure analysis and Hirshfeld surface analysis, their phase transitions are ascribed to the disorder of the cations and deformation of the inorganic chains.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Oligomers of Naphthalenediimides in Bulk and on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides were synthesized and found to assemble into lamellar morphologies in bulk and at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The results show that both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization condition play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering and raise the question of the trade&#8208;off between synthetic efforts and novel properties of molecularly perfect materials.







Abstract
Here, we report on the synthesis of discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and study their molecular nanostructures both in bulk, in solution, and at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. Via an iterative synthesis method, multiple NDI cores were bridged with short and saturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (C3 and C12) or long and unsaturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (u2C33 to u8C100) at their imide termini. The strong intermolecular interaction between the NDI cores was observed by probing their photophysical properties in solution. In bulk, the discrete NDI oligomers preferentially ordered in lamellar morphologies, irrespective of whether a saturated or unsaturated spacer was employed. Moreover, both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization conditions play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering. The long unsaturated alkyl chains lead preferably to folded&#8208;chain conformations while their saturated analogues form stretched arrangements. At the solution&#8208;solid interface, well&#8208;defined lamellar regions were observed. These results show that precision in chemical structure alone is not sufficient to reach well&#8208;defined structures of discrete oligomers, but that it must be combined with precision in processing conditions.

         <title>Breaking Radial Dipole Symmetry in Planar Macrocycles Modulates Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Edge Packing and Disrupts Cofacial Stacking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the direction of one of three triazole dipoles by just 40&#176; modulated all modes of self&#8208;assembly. While changes in the relative stability of 2D polymorphs on graphite surfaces was expected, disruption of face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking in 1D was not. These findings revealed the role of long&#8208;range dipole repulsions between stacked macrocycles.







Abstract
Dipolar interactions are ever&#8208;present in supramolecular architectures, though their impact is typically revealed by making dipoles stronger. While it is also possible to assess the role of dipoles by altering their orientations by using synthetic design, doing so without altering the molecular shape is not straightforward. We have now done this by flipping one triazole unit in a rigid macrocycle, tricarb. The macrocycle is composed of three carbazoles (2 Debye) and three triazoles (5 Debye) defining an array of dipoles aligned radially but organized alternately in and out. These dipoles are believed to dictate edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge tiling and face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. We modified our synthesis to prepare isosteric macrocycles with the orientation of one triazole dipole rotated 40&#176;. The new dipole orientation guides edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge contacts to reorder the stability of two surface&#8208;bound 2D polymorphs. The impact on dipole&#8208;enhanced &#960; stacking, however, was unexpected. Our stacking model identified an unchanged set of short&#8208;range (3.4&#8197;&#197;) anti&#8208;parallel dipole contacts. Despite this situation, the reduction in self&#8208;association was attributed to long&#8208;range (~6.4&#8197;&#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;&#8208;stacked macrocycles. This work highlights our ability to control the build&#8208;up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>A Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Substituted Benzotriazinyl Tetraradical
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical with a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state, high thermal stability, and reversible redox waves has been prepared by using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a triiodo&#8208;derivative of benzotriazinyl radical with a gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of an efficient catalytic system: Pd2(dba)3/MeCgPPh.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic tetraradicals with significant intramolecular exchange interactions have high potential for advanced technological applications and fundamental research, but those synthesized to date possess limited stability and processability. In this work, we have designed a tetraradical based on the Blatter's radical and nitronyl nitroxide radical moieties and successfully synthesized it by using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a triiodo&#8208;derivative of the 1,2,4&#8208;benzotriazinyl radical with gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of a newly developed efficient catalytic system. The molecular and crystal structure of the tetraradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The tetraradical possesses good thermal stability with decomposition onset at &#8764;150&#8201;&#176;C under an inert atmosphere and exhibits reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.54 and 0.45&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl. The magnetic properties of the tetraradical were characterized by SQUID magnetometry of polycrystalline powders and EPR spectroscopy in various matrices. The collected data, analyzed by using high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations, confirmed that the tetraradical has a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state. The unique high stability of the prepared triazinyl&#8208;nitronylnitroxide tetraradical is a new milestone in the field of creating high&#8208;spin systems.

         <title>A Primer on 2D Descriptors in Selectivity Modeling for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates are highlighted in this brief review. Two&#8208;dimensional descriptors offer the advantage of lower cost and higher speed in calculations than quantum chemical parameters. We provide an overview of a typical quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship workflow, including model building and validation techniques, as well as applications of these methodologies in the design of asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of the design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on a physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and the electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using the 2D structures of catalysts and substrates. While these have a less explicit mechanistic connection to the modeled property, 2D descriptors, such as topological indices, molecular fingerprints, and fragments, offer the tremendous advantages of low cost and high speed of calculations. This makes them optimal for the in&#8208;silico screening of large amounts of data. We provide an overview of common quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship workflow, model building and validation techniques, applications of these methodologies in asymmetric catalysis design, and an outlook on improving the understanding of 2D&#8208;based models.

         <title>Cu(II) Promoted C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation in Unactivated Cycloalkanes: Oxo&#8208;Alkylation of Styrenes to Synthesize &#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
Various &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketone derivatives are synthesized from styrenes via oxo&#8208;alkylation of unactivated cycloalkanes. Anhydrous CuCl2 acts as a catalyst in presence of TBHP oxidant and 1&#8208;methylimidazole base. A wide range of olefinic arenes as well as broad range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates are well tolerated in this protocol.







Abstract
We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.&#8201;g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.

Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl derivatives is described. The methodology, using ethyl diazoacetate, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes as a mixture of easily separable diastereoisomers in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from 2&#8208;substituted allylic derivatives is reported. Using ethyl diazo acetate, the reaction, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex (Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox), furnished the corresponding easily separable cis and trans cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (32&#8208;97&#8201;%) and excellent ee (86&#8208;99&#8201;%). This approach significantly extends the portfolio of accessible enantioenriched cyclopropanes from an underexplored class of olefins. DFT calculations suggest that an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism is operative in this system.

&lt;p&gt;The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from 2-substituted allylic derivatives is reported. Using ethyl diazo acetate, the reaction, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex (Ru(II)-Pheox), furnished the corresponding easily separable &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (32-97&#8201;%) and excellent ee (86-99&#8201;%). This approach significantly extends the portfolio of accessible enantioenriched cyclopropanes from an underexplored class of olefins. DFT calculations suggest that an outer-sphere mechanism is operative in this system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immobilizing Bimetallic RuCo Nanoalloys on Few&#8208;Layered MXene as a Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ice and fire: The ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloy&#8208;coupled exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) has been constructed by ice&#8208;templated and high&#8208;temperature activation approaches, which provide a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting.







Abstract
Doping Co atoms into Ru lattices can tune the electronic structure of active sites, and the conductive MXene can adjust the electrical conductivity of catalysts, which are both favorable for improving the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst for water splitting. Here, ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloys coupled with exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) have been constructed by ice&#8208;templated and thermal activation. Due to the strong interaction between the RuCo nanoalloys and conductive MXene, RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx not only exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential and Tafel slope (60&#8197;mV, 34.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 52&#8197;mV, 38.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH), but also good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte (266&#8197;mV, 111.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH). The assembled RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx||RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx electrolyzer requires a lower potential (1.56&#8197;V) than does the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A boosted catalytic HER activity from immobilizing the RuCo nanoalloys on MXene was unveiled by density functional theory calculations. This study provides a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>Chalcogen and Hydrogen Bond Team up in Driving Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Anion Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

The H&#8208;selenite anion (HSeO3&#8722;) can act as donor and acceptor of both hydrogen bond and chalcogen bond; the resulting anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion self&#8208;assembly forms uncommon and structurally different infinite chains featuring an unprecedented Janus&#8208;type team up between the two interactions.







Abstract
H&#8208;selenite anions (HSeO3&#8722;) form in the solid unprecedented anionic supramolecular chains wherein single units are assembled via alternating short Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O contacts. Crystallographic analyses and computational studies (the quantum theory of &#8220;atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules&#8221;, QTAIM, and the noncovalent interaction plot, NCIPlot) consistently prove the attractive nature of these chalcogen bonds (ChBs) and hydrogen honds (HBs), the Janus&#8208;type character of HSeO3&#8722; anions which act as both donors and acceptors of ChB and HB, and the possible stability of anion dimers in solution. The effectiveness of the ChBs herein described may lead to consider the HSeO3&#8722; moiety as a new entry in the toolbox of crystal engineering based on ChB.

         <title>Computational Design of &#945;&#8208;Conotoxins to Target Specific Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subtypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FoldX was benchmarked as the best energy prediction method, and seven accurate molecular models of &#945;&#8208;conotoxin/nAChRs were developed as surrogates for the experimental complexes. The combined use of FoldX and these molecular models emerged as an effective approach to predict &#945;&#8208;conotoxins with improved pharmaceutical properties. Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin variants designed by this method were successfully validated by experimental assay.







Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are drug targets for neurological diseases and disorders, but selective targeting of the large number of nAChR subtypes is challenging. Marine cone snail &#945;&#8208;conotoxins are potent blockers of nAChRs and some have been engineered to achieve subtype selectivity. This engineering effort would benefit from rapid computational methods able to predict mutational energies, but current approaches typically require high&#8208;resolution experimental structures, which are not widely available for &#945;&#8208;conotoxin complexes. Herein, five mutational energy prediction methods were benchmarked using crystallographic and mutational data on two acetylcholine binding protein/&#945;&#8208;conotoxin systems. Molecular models were developed for six nAChR subtypes in complex with five &#945;&#8208;conotoxins that were studied through 150 substitutions. The best method was a combination of FoldX and molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a predictive Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 (85&#8201;% accuracy). Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin mutants designed using this method were successfully validated by experimental assay with improved pharmaceutical properties. This work paves the way for the rapid design of subtype&#8208;specific nAChR ligands and potentially accelerated drug development.

         <title>Affinity of Telluronium Chalcogen Bond Donors for Lewis Bases in Solution: A Critical Experimental&#8208;Theoretical Joint Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized, and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. DFT and ab&#8208;initio methods reveal the driving role of coulombic and dispersion interactions in the formation of [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base).







Abstract
Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized, and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of Lewis bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. Structural X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 21 different salts revealed the electrophilicity of the Te centers in their interactions with anions. Telluroniums&#8217; propensity to form Lewis pairs was investigated with OPPh3. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy suggested that telluroniums can bind up to three OPPh3 molecules. Isotherm titration calorimetry showed that the related heats of association in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane depend on the electronic properties of the substituents of the aryl moiety and on the nature of the counterion. The enthalpies of first association of OPPh3 span &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Study of the affinity of telluroniums for OPPh3 by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT and ab&#8208;initio methods revealed the dominant Coulombic and dispersion interactions as well as an entropic effect favoring association in solution. Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar2MeTe]+ cations and OPPh3 are deemed insufficient on their own to ensure the cohesion of [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base). Comparison of Grimme's and Tkatchenko's DFT&#8208;D4/MBD&#8208;vdW thermodynamics of formation of higher [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes revealed significant molecular size&#8208;dependent divergence of the two methodologies, with MBD yielding better agreement with experiment.

Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeTe]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and OPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are deemed insufficient on their own to ensure the cohesion of [Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes in solution (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;=Lewis base). Comparison of Grimme's and Tkatchenko's DFT-D4/MBD-vdW thermodynamics of formation of higher [Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes revealed significant molecular size-dependent divergence of the two methodologies, with MBD yielding better agreement with experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of Luminescent Mononuclear Three&#8208;Coordinate CuI Complexes by Two Distinct Cavity&#8208;Shaped Diphosphanes Obtained from a Single &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Precursor</title>

Two for the price of one! Depending on the experimental conditions, two dramatically different diphosphanes can be obtained from diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. The metal confining properties of the cavity&#8208;shaped ligands have been exploited to produce luminescent chelate [CuX(PP)] complexes (X=Cl, Br, I).







Abstract
Slightly different reaction conditions afforded two distinct cavity&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes from the same starting materials, namely diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8211;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. Thanks to their metal&#8208;confining properties, the two diphosphanes form only mononuclear [CuX(PP)] complexes (X=Cl, Br, or I) with the tricoordinated metal ion located just above the center of the cavity. The two series of CuI complexes display markedly different luminescence properties that are both influenced by the electronic properties of the ligand and the unique steric environment provided by the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity. The excited state lifetimes of all complexes are significantly longer than those of the cavity&#8208;free analogues suggesting peculiar electronic effects that affect radiative deactivation constants. The overall picture stemming from absorption and emission data suggests close&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT, XLCT) and triplet ligand&#8208;centered (LC) excited states.
