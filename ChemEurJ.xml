         <title>In Situ Built ZnS/MXene Heterostructure by a Mild Method for Inhibiting Polysulfide Shuttle in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With high specific surface area, excellent polysulfide conversion activity, and fast electron/ion transfer at the interface, MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures can be employed as catalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries to accelerate sulfur redox kinetics and suppress shuttle effect. However, the preparation of MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures often requires high&#8208;temperature reactions, which can easily lead to the oxidation of MXene and sacrifice the electrical conductivity. Herein, a catalytic two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure (ZnS/MXene) was successfully synthesized via a mild method. The MXene skeleton retains the original nanosheet structure without oxidation. The in situ&#8208;grown ZnS nanospheres prevent the restacking of MXene nanosheets, which not only increases the active sites, but also guarantees channels for the fast passage of lithium ions. The interfacial built&#8208;in electric field further promotes electron/ion migration, thereby expediting the polysulfide conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the batteries using ZnS/MXene modified separators exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1230 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C and a low decaying rate of 0.082% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work offers a reference for the fabrication of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust, practical, and sustainable isomerization&#8208;suppressed peptide bond formation via acyl sulfonamide, a twisted amide, is disclosed. Tosyl isocyanate and pentafluorobenzyl bromide were applied in combination to activate the peptide C&#8208;terminus, which then reacted with an amine to yield an elongated peptide with high stereochemical purity. Careful analysis of NMR spectra of the active intermediate revealed the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond, suggesting that the hydrogen bond suppressed C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during amidation. The isomerization suppression by the intramolecular hydrogen bond is expected to be effective even under high dilution conditions, making the present method a powerful tool for the synthesis of complex macrocyclic peptides. In addition to peptide synthesis, the developed synthetic entry to twisted amides can be applied to the investigation of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed N&#8211;C bond activation. Moreover, the application to the N&#8211;C bond activation returned insight into peptide synthesis, leading to the use of sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid that can be orthogonally removed in the presence of other conventional protecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Centered Oligoynes Capped by Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dyes and Their Thin&#8208;Film Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the Nobel prize winning discovery that polyacetylene could act as a semiconductor, there has been tremendous efforts dedicated to understanding and harnessing the unusual properties of &#120587;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Much of this research has focused on the preparation of oligoynes and polyynes with well&#8208;defined numbers of repeating alkyne units as models for carbyne. These studies are usually hampered by a structure&#8208;property relationship where the stability of the resulting materials decrease with the incorporation of additional alkyne units. Here, we describe a series of oligoynes, with up to 12 alkyne units, where electron&#8208;rich [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units are incorporated into the center of oligoyne backbones which are capped by electron&#8208;poor BF2 formazanate dyes. These compounds exhibit excellent stability and solubility, panchromatic absorption, and redox activity characteristic of their structural components. These traits facilitated thin&#8208;film studies of extended oligoyne materials, where it is shown that incorporating [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units leads to smoother films, decreased conductivity on the microscale, and increased conductivity on the nanoscale when compared to metal&#8208;free analogs. Remarkably, our oligoynes have superior conductivity compared to the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) semiconductor.</dc:description>

         <title>Insoluble Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Type Receptors Capture Iodine from the Vapor Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear energy makes large contributions toward meeting global energy needs, but societal concerns remain high given the impacts of the intended release of radioactive materials including 129I and 131I. In this paper we explore the use of a homologous series of acyclic CB[n] type hosts (H1 &#8211; H4) as adsorbents of iodine from the vapor phase. We find that H2 &#8211; H4, but not H1 &#8211; perform well in this application with uptake capacities of 2.2 g g&#8208;1, 1.5&#160;g g&#8208;1, and 1.9&#160;g g&#8208;1, respectively. The chemisorptive uptake process involves partial oxidation of catechol walled H2 to quinone walled host and capture of I3&#8208; and I5&#8208;. Solid H2 can be regenerated by treatment with Na2S2O4 and reused at least five times. The x&#8208;ray crystal structure of H2 is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Hexadentate Pyclen&#8208;based Chelating Agent for Mild Radiofluorination in Aqueous Solution at Room Temperature with a Ga&#8208;18F Ternary Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used in oncology for tumor diagnosis, commonly relying on fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) emission detection. The conventional method of 18F incorporation on to probes by covalent bonding is harsh for sensitive biomolecules, which are nonetheless compounds of choice for the development of targeted probes. This study explores gallium&#8208;18F (Ga18F) coordination, a milder alternative method occurring in aqueous media at the final stage of radiosyntheses. Pyclen&#8208;based chelating agents were proposed to capture (GaF) species at room temperature and pH &#8805; 5 making the radiofluorination process compatible with heat&#8208; and acid&#8208;sensitive biomolecules. Highly promising results were obtained with the PC2A&#8208;based chelating agent LH2 derived from the new bifunctional PC2A&#8208;OAE&#8208;NCS compound. The solid&#8208;state structure of GaF(L) was elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and revealed an unconventional heptacoordination of Ga(III). A high radiochemical conversion (RCC) of 86% was achieved at room temperature, in water at pH 5 within 20 minutes. Stability studies showed the robustness of the GaF(L) complex in aqueous media for at least one day and at least one hour for the radiolabeled analog Ga18F(L). These findings demonstrated that PC2A&#8208;based compounds are chelating agents of choice for (Ga18F) species, suggesting a real technological breakthrough for PET imaging and precision medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>The many facets of RuII(dppe)2 acetylide compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character&#160; essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light&#8208;harvesting applications or non&#8208;linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection of Guanine Quadruplexes by Raman Optical Activity and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Interpretation of the Spectra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplexes formed by guanine derivatives or guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids are involved in metabolism and genetic storage of many living organisms, they are used in DNA nanotechnologies or as biosensors. Since many quadruplex geometries are possible the determination of their structures in aqueous solutions is difficult. Raman optical activity (ROA) can make it easier: For guanosine monophosphate (GMP), we observed a distinct change of the spectra upon its condensation and quadruplex formation. The vibrational bands become more numerous, stronger, and narrower. In particular, a huge ROA signal appears below 200 cm&#8208;1. The aggregation can be induced by high concentration, low temperature, or by a metal ion. We focused on well&#8208;defined quadruplexes stabilized by potassium, where using molecular dynamics and density functional theory the spectra and particular features related to GMP geometric parameters could be understood. The simulations explain the main experimental trends and confirm that the ROA spectroscopy is sensitive to fine structural details, including guanine base twist in the quadruplex helix.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzodihydrofurans Bearing Axial and Central Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of chiral compounds containing multiple stereogenic elements via a single catalytic step is a challenging process. In the presence of &#945;&#8208;chloronitrostyrenes and a chiral squaramide catalyst, C&#8211;C or C&#8211;N pro&#8208;axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthol substrates, featuring low barriers to enantiomerization, underwent a remote diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective domino Michael/O&#8208;alkylation. It provided the desired benzodihydrofurans bearing two stereogenic carbon atoms and a configurationally stable C&#8211;C or a C&#8211;N bond, thanks to a high increase of the barrier to rotation upon dihydrofurannulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Pd(II) Nanofiber Promoting Electron Transfer of g&#8208;C3N4 for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons is very important for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Here, chiral induced spin selectivity effect (CISS effect) was developed to accelerate electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. A chiral and achiral racemic supramolecular Pd(II) complex nanofiber was fabricated via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of chiral L&#8208;Py or its racemes with Pd(II) and used to modify carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). The obtained chiral photocatalyst L&#8208;Py&#8208;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4 and achiral photocatalyst Rac&#8208;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4, show enhanced photocatalytic activities with hydrogen evolution rates of 2476 and 1339 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, while that of pure g&#8208;C3N4 is 30.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Chiral photocatalyst has 85% higher activity than achiral one and is 82.5&#8208;fold of pure g&#8208;C3N4, due to better suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs in the interface of g&#8208;C3N4 contact with chiral molecule. Spectral tests and photoelectrochemical tests proved that the chiral supramolecular Pd(II) complex can act both as an electron spin filter and hydrogen reduction catalytic center to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. This work offers a new route to facilitate electron transfer by the CISS effect for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of low&#8208;toxicity antimicrobial polycarbonates bearing lysine residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibiotic resistance has been threatening public health for a long period, while the COVID pandemic aggravated the scenario. To combat antibiotic resistance strains, host defense peptides (HDPs) mimicking molecules have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported a series of polycarbonates bearing cationic lysine amino acid residues that could mimic the mechanism of action of HDPs and possess broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity. Moreover, those polymers had negligible toxicity toward red blood cells and mammalian cells. The membrane&#8208;disruption mechanism endows the lysine&#8208;containing polycarbonates with low possibility of resistance development and the fast killing kinetics, making them promising candidates for antimicrobial development.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Luminescence Vapochromism of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic vapochromic materials which undergo a drastic change in their photophysical properties upon exposure to vapors or gases are attracting growing scientific attention because of their low price and wide range of possible applications. In this work, luminescence vapochromism of carbazole&#8208;pyridinium&#8208;based organic salts with a general structure of (CzPy)X (CzPy+ = 2,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridinium ion; X = Cl, Br or I) is reported. It was found that (CzPy)X compounds form J&#8208;aggregates, which rearranged back to monomeric form upon exposure to methanol, ethanol, acetone, and water vapors. In contrast, acetonitrile was found to promote the J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds by occupying the voids in their crystal lattice and pushing cations closer together. It was further demonstrated that the efficiency of J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds depends on the size of the anion, which was employed to realize dynamic luminescence vapochromism, with vapochromic response times ranging from a couple of minutes in (CzPy)Cl to more than an hour in (CzPy)I. In addition, (CzPy)X compounds exhibited high melting points of about 250 &#176;C and excellent thermal stability. (CzPy)Cl and (CzPy)Br have also shown good photoluminescence quantum yields at room temperature in a solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Study of PtM (M=Cu, Zn, Ga, Mn, Fe, In, Ce) Bimetals on Zincosilicate for Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicoaluminate zeolites have relatively strong Br&#246;nsted (B) acid properties that can easily lead to deep cracking reactions, making them less favourable as carriers for propane dehydrogenation. Here, we utilise zincosilicate zeolite with less B&#8208;acid produced by the introduction of the heteroatom Zn into the framework as a carrier, followed by simultaneous ion exchange (IE) of M monometallic or PtM bimetallic (M = Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). The optimized PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 exhibits a superior propane dehydrogenation performance over PtCu/Zn&#8208;4 and PtGa/Zn&#8208;4, which can achieve a propane conversion of about 30% in a pure propane atmosphere at 550 &#176;C and can be operated for at least 168 h without significant deactivation. Characterization techniques such as spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy with different gas adsorptions are used to investigate these PtM@zeolite catalysts in order to deepen the understanding of acid site identification, promoter effect and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination and hydrodefluorination of aryl fluorides promoted by solvated electrons.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling reactions for constructing C&#8208;N bonds represent a pivotal advancement in chemical science. Traditional methodologies, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, have limitations concerning aryl scope, reliance on toxic and costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and issues related to atom economy and waste generation from ligands and additives. In this work, we introduce a novel method for aminating neutral, electron&#8208;rich, and electron&#8208;deficient aryl halides, eliminating the need for transition metals. Our approach involves the activation of aryl halides using solvated electrons generated from granulated lithium and sonication. This serves as a sustainable source of reducing power, facilitating the efficient formation of C&#8208;N bonds under near ambient conditions. Competitive selectivity studies between halide and ester functionalities were explored. Reaction scope and conducted mechanistic studies support the proposed radical&#8208;nucleophilic substitution (SRN1) mechanism for the reaction. Notably, the developed reaction has a highly competitive reductive dehalogenation pathway during the C&#8208;N coupling reaction, and this mechanistic divergency was thoroughly explored. This work not only broadens the scope of C&#8208;N coupling reactions which typically employs aryl bromides and iodides and rarely aryl fluorides which is also equally abundant, but also introduces a new way to do C&#8208;N coupling reactions using solvated electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cycloparaphenylene Acetylene as Potential Precursor for an Armchair Carbon Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a long&#8208;standing goal in synthetic chemists. Producing CNTs with defined lengths and diameters would render these materials and thus their fascinating properties accessible in a controlled way. Inspired by a recently reported synthesis of armchair graphene sheets that relied on a benzannulation and Scholl oxidation of a poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene), the same strategy is applied on a cyclic substrate with a short, but well defined CNT as target structure. Herein we report the synthesis of a derivatized [12]cyclo&#173;para&#173;phenylene acetylene ([12]CPPA) that was accessible employing a Sonogashira macro&#173;cyclization. The obtained macrocycle is the largest [n]CPPA reported to date and displays bright turquoise fluorescence with a large quantum yield of 77%. The [12]CPPA can be transformed by a 12&#8208;fold benzannulation that converts each alkyne to a naphthalene and therefore allows formation of an armchair [12,12] CNT precursor. The final 72&#8208;fold Scholl oxidation to the [12,12] CNT turned out to be challenging and its optimization requires an improved synthetic strategy to produce large quantities of the final precursor. The developed approach poses a potential break through strategy for the production of CNTs and certainly incentivizes synthetic chemists to apply the same methodology for various conjugated macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Molecular Textiles: Synthesis and Characterization of Molecular Patches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This works describes a new step into the assembly of molecular textiles by the use of covalent templating. To establish a well&#8208;founded base and to tackle pre&#8208;mature obstacles, expected during the fabrication of the desired 2D&#8208;material, we opted to investigate the in&#8208;solution synthesis of molecular patches e.g. cut&#8208;outs of a textile. A bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped monomer was designed, synthesized and was in&#8208;detail characterized by means of 1H&#8208;NMR and chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopy. In addition, x&#8208;ray structure crystallography was used to assess the absolute configuration. The monomer was used in an in&#8208;solution oligomerization to assemble the molecular patches via imine condensation, which revealed the formation of predominately dimeric patches. &#160;The imine&#8208;oligomer mixtures were further analyzed by reduction and cleaved to investigate the conditions required post mono&#8208;layer assembly. All reaction stages were followed by FT&#8208;IR and 1H&#8208;NMR analysis. Finally, we address the adsorption of the cross&#8208;shaped monomer onto a Au(111) surface, via high vacuum electrospray deposition. The subsequent annealing of the interface induced the on&#8208;surface imine condensation reaction, leading to unidimensional oligomers co&#8208;adsorbed with clusters of cyclic&#8208;dimers. Nc&#8208;AFM analysis revealed the tridimensional molecular structures, and together with electrospray deposition technique showed to be a promising pathway to investigate potential monomer candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirocyclopropanes and Substituted Furans by Controlling Reactivity of 1,3&#8208;Enynoates: &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;Addition of Phosphines to Conjugate Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>In the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction, a nucleophile undergoes &#946;&#8208;addition to activated alkenes or alkynes, forming reactive intermediates for subsequent carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;hetero bond formation. By using a &#960;&#8208;conjugated acceptor, however, an unprecedented reactivity of 1,3&#8208;enynoates and indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones was uncovered in the presence of phosphines. When&#160;indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were used,&#160;&#947;&#8208;addition of phosphines to 1,3&#8208;enynoates was observed for the first time; moderate to good yields were obtained for 14 substances containing the prominent spirocyclopropane scaffold with 100% retention of (Z)&#8208;alkene. When 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were used, di(tri)&#8208;substituted furans were produced through the &#948;&#8208;addition pathway, with 20 substances and a yield of up to 88% being achieved.

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels from Nanodiamonds and a Self&#8208;Assembling Tripeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the successful assembly of a tripeptide in the presence of nanodiamonds (NDs) into nanocomposite hydrogels. The presence of NDs does not hinder peptide self&#8208;assembly and gelation, whilst improving the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels. Gelation kinetics are not affected by NDs, while the elastic moduli of the peptide hydrogels are significantly increased by the NDs. Increased resistance of the gels against applied stress can also be attained depending on the amount of NDs loaded in the nanocomposite. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy and TEM confirmed the presence of NDs on the surface, and not in the interior, of peptide nanofibers. Peptide&#8208;ND non&#8208;covalent interactions are also probed by Raman and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopies. Overall, this work enables the embedding of NDs into nanocomposite hydrogels formed through the self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide at physiological pH, and it provides key insights to open the way for their future applications in biomaterials, for instance exploiting their luminescence and near&#8208;infrared responsiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in Isoelectronic Analogues of Benzene, Carborazine and Borazine, from Electronic Structure and Magnetic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carborazine (B2C2N2H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are isoelectronic analogues of benzene (C6H6). The aromatic character of borazine have basically reached a consensus after a long period of controversy, but the related properties of carborazine are even rarely reported. In this work, we systematically investigated the geometric structure, charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital characteristics, bonding, electronic delocalization, magnetic shielding effect, and induced ring current of carborazine and borazine, and compared the studied characteristics with those of benzene to determine the aromatic character of the two analogues. The combination of multiple properties shows that although they are isoelectronic, carborazine is evidently aromatic, while borazine only exhibits rather weak aromaticity. The C atom acting as a connecting bridge between B and N atoms in carborazine reduces the electronegativity difference on the molecular backbone and enhances the electronic delocalization over the conjugated path, which is the essence of the distinct disparity of aromaticity between carborazine and borazine.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using formate salts as the reductant was developed. A wide range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into aniline products in a transition metal free fashion. Mechanistic studies revealed that radical species (carbon dioxide radical anion and thiol radical) are key intermediates for the transformation. We anticipate that this method will provide a valuable and green strategy for the reduction of nitrobenzenes.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Glycosylation&#8208;Induced Pathologic Protein Conformations as a Tool to Guide the Selection of Biologically Active Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic model for the prediction of ligand residence times in protein targets, taking explicitly into account normal vs. pathologic conformations of chaperone Grp94, is developed and tested. Analysis of binding site and ligand stereoelectronic properties unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities of ligands. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting pathologic Grp94 conformations.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications such as protein N&#8208;glycosylation, significantly influence cellular processes. Dysregulated N&#8208;glycosylation, exemplified in Grp94, a member of the Hsp90 family, leads to structural changes and the formation of epichaperomes, contributing to pathologies. Targeting N&#8208;glycosylation&#8208;induced conformations offers opportunities for developing selective chemical tools and drugs for these pathologic forms of chaperones. We here demonstrate how a specific Grp94 conformation induced by N&#8208;glycosylation, identified previously via molecular dynamics simulations, rationalizes the distinct behavior of similar ligands. Integrating dynamic ligand unbinding information with SAR development, we differentiate ligands productively engaging the pathologic Grp94 conformers from those that are not. Additionally, analyzing binding site stereoelectronic properties and QSAR models using cytotoxicity data unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting specific Grp94 conformations induced by abnormal glycosylation, selectively disrupting pathogenic protein networks while sparing normal mechanisms.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Topological Supramolecular Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (SPs) perfectly integrated the dynamic nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. The HBP&#8208;based SPs with fascinating topologies have aroused tremendous attention due to their structural novelty and attractive applications. This concept overviews the current progress on the construction and self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The dynamic or reversible nature of SPs endows them unique physical and chemical properties, such as self&#8208;adaptive and stimuli&#8208;response abilities. The topological structures of SPs play an important role in determining the physicochemical properties and functionality. Hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) are highly branched 3D macromolecules with linear, dendritic, and terminal units, which makes them versatile candidates for the construction of SPs with fascinating architectures. The resultant HBP&#8208;based SPs perfectly integrated the dynamic/reversible nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. To date, various types of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies have been constructed, and their potential applications have been explored as well. This article overviews the current progress on self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs. The strategies for construction of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies are discussed. Typical potential applications of the assemblies of HBP&#8208;based SPs are also introduced.

We designed seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives by considering previous machine&#8208;learning study indicating that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of DBTs exhibit hole mobilities of up to 0.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Inspired by the previous machine&#8208;learning study that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors, seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives 1&#8201;a&#8211;g (NHBA=5) were designed and synthesized by one&#8208;step functionalization from a common precursor. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses confirmed that the molecular arrangements of 1b (the diethyl and ethylthienyl derivative) and 1c (the di(n&#8208;propyl) and n&#8208;propylthienyl derivative) in the crystal are classified into brickwork structures with multidirectional intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer integrals, as a result of incorporation of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of 1b and 1c had hole mobilities of 0.16 and 0.029&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>The Hydronaphthalide Monoanion: Isolation of the &#8220;red transient&#8221; Birch Intermediate from liquid Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the isolation and full characterisation of a reactive intermediate from the Birch reduction which was first observed in 1939.The historically as transient described compound was isolated as an organic salt from the reaction of naphthalene, sodium, and tetramethylammonium chloride in liquid ammonia. The trapped intermediate demonstrates a tamed reduction potential enabling higher reaction control compared to stronger reducing agents.







Abstract
Birch reactions employing alkali metals in ammonia have been a well&#8208;established method for the reduction and functionalisation of aromatic compounds for nearly 100&#8197;years. Speculations regarding intermediates in the reaction pathway have been discussed since the beginning. We hereby report the isolation of NMe4(HNaph) (1), a kinetically trapped intermediate of the Birch reaction of naphthalene and sodium in liquid ammonia. 1 has been fully characterised and has been shown to continue to react to 1,2/1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene &#8211; the Birch product of the reduction of naphthalene. The reactivity of 1 was investigated towards activity as an electron and hydride transfer agent with both, elements and small organic molecules. 1 demonstrates a tamed reduction potential which allows for controlled reactions such as the selective formation of hexasulphide and hexaselenide anions.

         <title>Steric Effect and Intrinsic Electrophilicity and Nucleophilicity from Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Information&#8208;Theoretic Approach as Quantitative Probes of Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using charge fluctuation descriptors, the intrinsic reaction coordinate is partitioned into three regions which are called Pre&#8208;TS, TS and Post&#8208;TS respectively. For 37 organic and inorganic reactions, linear correlations are found within the three regions between the total energy difference and the steric or charge transfer descriptors. The use of charge fluctuation instead of global reactivity descriptors gives clearer separation of the reaction path which is further justified via energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Appreciating reactivity in terms of physicochemical effects for chemical processes is one of the most important undertakings in chemistry. While transition state (TS) theory provides the framework enabling the reliable calculation of the barrier height for a given elementary step, analytical tools are necessary to gain insight into key factors governing the different processes during chemical reactions. In this contribution, we partition the potential energy surface of an elementary step along the intrinsic coordinate into three segments, the so&#8208;called Pre&#8208;TS, TS, and Post&#8208;TS regions, and then determine the most important factors dictating each segment. This analysis is based on the use of both reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and concepts from the information&#8208;theoretic approach in density functional theory. We found that in both Pre&#8208;TS and Post&#8208;TS regions, steric effects are the dominant factors, whereas in the TS region, it is the intrinsic electrophilic and nucleophilic propensity of the transition state structure that governs the reactivity. The wide applicability of our approach is shown by a validation for a total of 37 organic and inorganic reactions. Different partition approaches from density functional theory, energy decomposition analysis and wavefunction&#8208;based resonance theory are employed to support our main conclusions.

         <title>Tuning Energetics of 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2H+ PCET Properties with Model Ru&#8208;bisamido Complexes</title>

Fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures allows control over energetic parameters in a family of complexes that undergo multi&#8208;redox 2e&#8722;/2H+ processes. The orbital overlap gives structural energy stabilization for potential inversion.







Abstract
Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&#8722; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&#8722;/1H+ reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&#8722;/2H+ redox changes. Complexes [(X2bpy)RuII(en*)2](PF6)2 and [(X2bpy)RuIV(en*&#8208;H)2](PF6)2 have been synthesized with bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;subtitutions X=&#8722;NMe2, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;Me, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3; and en*=2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV&#8208;vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, pKa&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in the en* ligands. The average BDFEs for the overall 2e&#8722;/2H+ PCET span over 5&#8197;kcal/mol. Notably, these complexes all show marked potential inversion over an extended range, &#916;pKa&gt;25&#8197;units and &#916;E0&gt;1.4&#8197;V. Potential inversion remains despite the electronic influence of bpy's substitutions which regulate N&#8722;H properties several bonds apart by trans&#8208;effect over d&#960;&#8208;molecular orbitals at the Ru center. The experimental and computational results presented in this work support the presence of strong coupling between electrons and protons, for modelling insights of 2e&#8722;/2H+ transfer reactivity.

         <title>A Highly Selective Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Activity in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of a highly selective fluorescent probe for the transmembrane thyroid hormone transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). The halogen bond forming ability of the iodine atoms with the transporter and the presence of a free carboxylic acid group are essential for the MCT8 selectivity.







Abstract
Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a trans&#8208;membrane transporter, which mediates the cellular delivery of thyroid hormones, L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3&#8242;&#8208;triiodo&#8208;L&#8208;thyronine (T3). In humans, the MCT8 protein is encoded by the SLC16A2 gene and mutations in the transporter cause a genetic neurological disorder known as Allan&#8208;Herndon&#8208;Dudley Syndrome (AHDS). MCT8 deficiency leads to impaired transport of thyroid hormones in the brain. Radiolabelled T4 and T3 or LC/MS&#8208;MS methods have been used to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. Herein, we developed a fluorescent based assay to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. A dansyl&#8208;based fluorescent probe having L&#8208;thyroxine moiety is found to be highly selective towards MCT8 in living cells. The high selectivity of the probe towards MCT8 can be attributed to the halogen bond&#8208;mediated recognition by the transporter protein. The presence of a free carboxylic acid group is essential for the specificity of the probe towards MCT8. Additionally, the selectivity of the probe for MCT8 is abolished upon esterification of the carboxylic group. Similarly, MCT8 does not recognize the probe when it contains a free amine group.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pyridylation of Alkynamides with Pyridylboronic Acids: A Route to Functionalized Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids under rhodium catalysis has been developed, providing a practical approach to the stereoselective synthesis of valuable alkenylpyridines with amide group using readily available reagents and a commercial catalyst. Further applications of pyridylation product from Weinreb amide to construct &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and aldehyde were demonstrated, offering a practical route to synthesizing diverse functionalized alkenylpyridines.







Abstract
The catalytic direct hydroarylation of alkynamides is a highly efficient approach for accessing functionalized trisubstituted arylalkenes with amide groups. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids, producing a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary enamides with high yields (up to 94&#8201;%). This reaction demonstrates broad tolerance towards various alkyl and aryl functional groups, providing convenient access to a diverse array of alkenylpyridine derivatives. To demonstrate potential applications in late&#8208;stage hydropyridylation, we synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aldehydes, and esters with high yields from the pyridylation product of Weinreb amides. This indirect expansion of the substrate scope enhances the practicality of this strategy. Additionally, the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone obtained can be further reduced to yield a chiral alcohol with a 99&#8201;% ee, further demonstrating the versatility and potential utility of this approach.

Adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene derivative leads to the reversal of supramolecular chirality of the SAMN through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule.







Abstract
The understanding of supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) on surfaces generates a lot of interest because of its relation to the production of chiral sensors, reactors, and catalysts. We herein report the adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (cDBA) derivative. Through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule, the supramolecular chirality of the SAMN is switched: the cDBA exclusively forms a counter&#8208;clockwise pore through co&#8208;adsorption of the solvent molecule in prochiral 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, while in 1&#8208;phenyloctane it produces the opposite chiral, clockwise pore. The prochirality recognition of the solvent molecule in the chiral SAMN pores is attributed to the adaptable conformational changes of the chiral chains of the cDBA molecule.

         <title>Improving Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance of High&#8208;Density Polyethylene Grades by Comonomer Addition and Nanocomposite Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study aims to assess how polymer density, influenced by comonomer content and nanosilica addition, impacts the mechanical and ESCR of HDPE. Results showed varying tensile properties and ESCR based on comonomer content. Additionally, incorporating chemically modified nanosilica improved ESCR by 40&#8201;%, as revealed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and NCI plots.







Abstract
The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of polymer density, correlated to the comonomer content, and nanosilica addition on the mechanical and Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR) characteristics of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE). In this regard, five HDPE samples with similar Melt Flow Index (MFI) and molar mass but various densities were acquired from a petrochemical plant. Two polymerization reactors work in series and differ only in the amount of 1&#8208;buene comonomer fed to the second reactor. To ascertain the microstructure of the studied samples, GPC and SSA (successive self&#8208;nucleation and annealing) analyses were accomplished. All samples resulted having similar characteristics but slightly various SCB/1000&#8197;C=7.26&#8211;9.74 (SCB=Short Chain Branching). Consequently, meanwhile studied HDPEs reveal similar notched impact and stress at yield values, the tensile modulus, stress&#8208;at&#8208;break, and elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break tend to demonstrate different results with the SCB content. More significantly, ESCR characteristic varied considerably with SCB/1000&#8197;C extent, so that higher amount of SCB acknowledged advanced ESCR. Notably, blending HDPE sample containing higher amount of SCB/1000&#8197;C, with 3&#8197;wt.% of chemically modified nanosilica enhanced ESCR characteristic by 40&#8201;%. DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations unveiled the role of the comonomer, quantitatively by binding energies and qualitatively by Non Covalent Interaction (NCI) plots.

         <title>Concentration Controlling of Carboxylic Ester&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Low Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of moderate concentrations of LiDFOB and FEC has established a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF. This effectively suppresses side reactions between the electrolyte and lithium metal and promotes the desolvation process of Li+. Li/LCO batteries using this electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Low temperature has been a major challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to maintain satisfied electrochemical performance, and the main reason is the deactivation of electrolyte with the decreasing temperature. To address this point, in present work, we develop a low&#8208;temperature resistant electrolyte which includes ethyl acetate (EA) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as solvent and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) as the primary lithium salt. Due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB and FEC, a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF is formed on the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, contributing to higher stability and rapid desolvation of Li+ ions. The batteries with the optimized electrolyte can undergo cycling tests at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a capacity retention of 83.9&#8201;% after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent compatibility with both LCO cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes, enabling a Gr/LCO battery to maintain a capacity retention of 90.3&#8201;% after multiple cycles at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C. This work proposes a cost&#8208;effective electrolyte that can activate potential LIBs in practical scenarios, especially in low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Robust and Irreversible Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation by Empolyment of Sarkosyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sarkosyl significantly enhances sortase&#8208;mediated ligation by promoting substrate solubility, sorting motif accessibility and rendering reaction irreversibility, thereby leading to excellent ligation yields. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, offering a powerful approach for conjugating aggregation&#8208;prone substrates in peptide and protein chemistry.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a widely used method for peptide and protein ligation due to ease of substrate preparation and fast enzymatic kinetics. But there are drawbacks that limit broader applications. Sorting motif in substrates may not be exposed to sortase efficiently due to folding or aggregation. In addition, the ligation is reversible under transpeptidation equilibrium that restricts ligation yield. Here we report a simple but robust method to overcome such limitations. By employment of sarkosyl, the detergent alters substrate conformation to raise sorting motif accessibility for sortase catalysis. Moreover, transpeptidation becomes irreversible presumably by formation of micelle to shield ligation products from sortase. In consequence, excellent yields were achieved from sortase variants with different substrate specificity. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), presenting a powerful approach for the conjugation of aggregation&#8208;prone substrates. Therefore, we believe the sarkosyl&#8208;enhanced SML could be widely applied in peptide and protein chemistry and the unique irreversible transpeptidation mechanism offers an insight to detergent&#8208;driven equilibrium.

Designed high&#8208;voltage electrolytes with stabilities of up to 7 Volt by incorporation of fluoroether linkers into pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated, pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids (FDILs) as high&#8208;performance electrolytes in energy storage devices have been prepared, displaying unprecedented electrochemical stabilities (up to 7&#8197;V); thermal stability (up to 370&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport (up to 1.45&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). FDILs were designed with a fluorinated ether linker and paired with TFSI/FSI counterions. To comprehensively assess the impact of the fluorinated spacer on their electrochemical, thermal, and physico&#8208;chemical properties, a comparison with their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts was conducted. With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the impact of the Li&#8208;salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage energy storage systems.

&lt;p&gt;Novel fluorinated, pyrrolidinium-based dicationic ionic liquids (FDILs) as high-performance electrolytes in energy storage devices have been prepared, displaying unprecedented electrochemical stabilities (up to 7&#8197;V); thermal stability (up to 370&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport (up to 1.45&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). FDILs were designed with a fluorinated ether linker and paired with TFSI/FSI counterions. To comprehensively assess the impact of the fluorinated spacer on their electrochemical, thermal, and physico-chemical properties, a comparison with their non-fluorinated counterparts was conducted. With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next-generation high-voltage lithium-ion batteries, the impact of the Li-salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next-generation high-voltage energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition State Stabilizing Effects of Oxygen and Sulfur Chalcogen Bond Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition stabilizing effects of chalcogen bonding interactions of oxygen and sulfur were studied using molecular rotors. The transition stabilizing effects of sulfur and oxygen chalcogen bonds were quantitatively measured and compared. Their strengths strongly correlated with the calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) on the surface of the chalcogen atoms in contact with the chalcogen bond donor.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bond (ChB) interactions have found utility in many fields, including catalysis, organic semiconductors, and crystal engineering. In this study, the transition stabilizing effects of ChB interactions of oxygen and sulfur were experimentally measured using a series of molecular rotors. The rotors were designed to form ChB interactions in their bond rotation transition states. This enabled the kinetic influences to be assessed by monitoring changes in the rotational barriers. Despite forming weaker ChB interactions, the smaller chalcogens were able to stabilize transition states and had measurable kinetic effects on the rotational barriers. Sulfur stabilized the bond rotation transition state by as much as &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol without electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The key was to design a system where the sulfur 

&#963;

 ${\sigma }$



&#8208;hole was aligned with the lone pairs of the chalcogen bond acceptor. Oxygen rotors also could form transition state stabilizing ChB interactions but required electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For both oxygen and sulfur ChB interactions, a strong correlation was observed between transition state stabilizing abilities and electrostatic potential (ESP) of the chalcogen, providing a useful predictive parameter for the rational design of future ChB systems.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach for Enhanced CO2 Capture with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ru catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 are not easily obtained through simple ligand modification. However, adopting an active descriptor that is obtained from the simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) is demonstrated as an efficient strategy to understand the catalytic activity.







Abstract
To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and utilize CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly the ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8722;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8722;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8722;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel ruthenium complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.

         <title>Symmetric Aromatic Amidoalkylations of Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amidoalkylation method of triphenylene derivatives is reported leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric compounds in good yields. The reaction takes place in the hindered bay regions of the compound for which very few functionalization methods are known in the literature.







Abstract
Triphenylene derivatives are highly investigated for their electronic, supramolecular and photophysical properties, but the direct modification of the central aromatic core is particularly challenging especially in the internal positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12. Herein we present an efficient alkylation method of 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexasubstituted triphenylene derivatives leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric derivatives in good yields using N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)carboxamide or N&#8208;(alkoxylmethyl)carboxamide alkylating agents.

A series of titanium &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3) reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M=Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K consist of a &#956;2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na contains a T&#8208;shape &#956;3&#8208;nitrido ligand with the sodium cation interacting with the aryl substituent.







Abstract
A series of titanium &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiCl] (1&#8208;Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M=Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 2&#8208;Li, 2&#8208;Na, and 2&#8208;K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K contain a &#956;2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na includes a &#956;3&#8208;nitrido ligand as part of a T&#8208;shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (3&#8208;M) (M=Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy&#8208;N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-nitrido complexes M[(Xy-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N)Ti=N-Ti(Xy-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N)] (&lt;b&gt;2-M&lt;/b&gt;; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of &lt;b&gt;2-Li&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2-Na&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2-K&lt;/b&gt; revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While &lt;b&gt;2-Li&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2-K&lt;/b&gt; contain a &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, &lt;b&gt;2-Na&lt;/b&gt; includes a &#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-nitrido ligand as part of a T-shape Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Xy-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N)] (&lt;b&gt;3-M&lt;/b&gt;) (M=Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N)H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy has afforded a molecular necklace from two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, and four Zn2+ ions, in an overall yield of 69&#8201;% over three steps (assembly, imine reduction, and amine protonation).







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate an &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy for assembling interlocked molecules through dynamic imine formation, &#8220;establishing&#8221; the host recognition sites in&#8197;situ. Using Zn2+ ions to template the assembly of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycle with semidumbbell&#8208;shaped triazole&#8208;containing aldehyde and amine derivatives, we obtained the corresponding [2]rotaxane in high yield (85&#8201;%) after subsequent imine reduction (NaBH4) and amine protonation (NH4PF6). We performed the same three steps (assembly, reduction, protonation) to prepare a stable and highly symmetrical [5]molecular necklace ([5]MN) from 12 components (two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, four Zn2+ ions) in an overall yield of 69&#8201;%.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Centred, Zirconocene&#8208;Bridged Tetraradical: Synthesis, Structure and Application as Molecular Double Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical linked to a zirconocene fragment is presented, which can act as a molecular switch both in solution and in the solid state. This new hybrid switch was used to switch H2 addition on and off, which can be controlled photochemically.







Abstract
Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, rac&#8208;(ebthi)ZrCl2 (rac&#8208;(ebthi)=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl), two cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zirconcene&#8208;bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (5) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#8197;nm), this tetraradical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five&#8208;membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane 5&#8201;h. Upon irradiation at 415&#8197;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully recovering tetraradical 5. Through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD. The switching under the influence of light and the activation of molecular hydrogen were analysed in solution using NMR and UV spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of one or two equivalents of molecular hydrogen can be switched on and off by light.

         <title>Building 3D Crosslinked Graphene&#8208;MXene Nanoarchitectures Decorated with MoS2 Quantum Dots Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust co&#8208;assembly method is developed to the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;MXene nanoarchitectures decorated with MoS2 quantum dots, which possess superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Although MoS2 quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom&#8208;up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene frameworks decorated with MoS2 quantum dots (MQD/RGO&#8208;MX) via a convenient co&#8208;assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO&#8208;MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso&#8208; and macropores, well&#8208;dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45&#8197;mV, a small Tafel slope of 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS2 quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Photosynthesis is a complex multi&#8208;step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the utilization of solar energy. In order to improve the utilization of sunlight, researchers have developed a variety of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems to simulate photosynthesis in nature. Here, we report a supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution. Since &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) has a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface, we adopt &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) as the host molecule and use adamantane as the guest molecule. At the same time, we modified &#946;&#8208;CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects. By using fluorescent molecules with AIE, the self&#8208;quenching effect caused by aggregation in aqueous solution can be effectively avoided. Due to the host&#8208;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD and adamantane, nanoparticles with stable structure and uniform size can be spontaneously assembled in water. Because of the close distance and strong spectral overlap between naphthalimide and tetraphenylethylene, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was realized, and artificial light&#8208;harvesting system was successfully constructed in aqueous solution. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for constructing artificial light&#8208;harvesting system, and the artificial light&#8208;harvesting system shows broad application prospects in aqueous solutions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis is a complex multi-step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the utilization of solar energy. In order to improve the utilization of sunlight, researchers have developed a variety of artificial light-harvesting systems to simulate photosynthesis in nature. Here, we report a supramolecular artificial light-harvesting system in aqueous solution. Since &#946;-cyclodextrin (&#946;-CD) has a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface, we adopt &#946;-cyclodextrin (&#946;-CD) as the host molecule and use adamantane as the guest molecule. At the same time, we modified &#946;-CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effects. By using fluorescent molecules with AIE, the self-quenching effect caused by aggregation in aqueous solution can be effectively avoided. Due to the host-guest interaction of &#946;-CD and adamantane, nanoparticles with stable structure and uniform size can be spontaneously assembled in water. Because of the close distance and strong spectral overlap between naphthalimide and tetraphenylethylene, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was realized, and artificial light-harvesting system was successfully constructed in aqueous solution. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for constructing artificial light-harvesting system, and the artificial light-harvesting system shows broad application prospects in aqueous solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Syntheses of Diarylmethanes Via an Oxidative Benzylic Functionalization of P&#8208;Alkyl Phenol Derivatives Under Quaternary Ammonium Hypoiodite Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Two oxidative quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;catalyzed strategies for the syntheses of diarylmethanes starting from simple p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives have been successfully implemented.







Abstract
We herein report two strategies for the quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;mediated oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives. By using either dibenzoylperoxide or H2O2 in hexafluoroisopropanol in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide gives access to activated intermediates which can then be coupled with electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds. Overall, this sequential two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot procedure gives access to diversely decorated diarylmethane derivatives straightforwardly. Furthermore, the suitability of these products to undergo further oxidation reactions was successfully demonstrated.

A unique high&#8208;valent formal Cu(III) iodide complex was prepared from tris(trifluoromethyl)copper pyridine adduct by weak Lewis base addition and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Pyridine adduct undergoes ligand substitution with tridentate pincer ligands to give formally octahedral Cu(III)(CF3)3 species, with high potential for applications.







Abstract
Copper(III) iodide and bromide complexes representing a unique combination of highly&#8208;coordinated metal and soft polarizable anions were synthesized and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Uncovering Factors Controlling Reactivity of Metal&#8208;TEMPO Reaction Systems in the Solid State and Solution</title>

The reactivity of Et(Cl)Zn with TEMPO is explored as a novel platform for systematic studies on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on the O&#8208; vs N&#8208;radical scavenger TEMPO mode. The reported in&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical studies revealed how the electronic, conformational and steric effects act synergistically in turning the coordinated TEMPO molecule from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical scavenger.







Abstract
Nitroxides find application in various areas of chemistry, and a more in&#8208;depth understanding of factors controlling their reactivity with metal complexes is warranted to promote further developments. Here, we report on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on both the distribution of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;centered spin density in 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and turning TEMPO from the O&#8208; to N&#8208;radical mode scavenger in metal&#8208;TEMPO systems. We use Et(Cl)Zn/TEMPO model reaction system with tuneable reactivity in the solid state and solution. Among various products, a unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct of Cl2Zn with the N&#8208;ethylated TEMPO was isolated and structurally characterised, and the so&#8208;called solid&#8208;state &#8242;slow chemistry&#8242; reaction led to a higher yield of the N&#8208;alkylated product. The revealed structure&#8208;activity/selectivity correlations are exceptional yet are entirely rationalised by the mechanistic underpinning supported by theoretical calculations of studied model systems. This work lays a foundation and mechanistic blueprint for future metal/nitroxide systems exploration.

         <title>The Quest for Stable Borozene Core in Main&#8208;Group Capped Inverse Sandwich Complexes, [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8722; (E=B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl)</title>

         <dc:description>
Orbital Engineering helps to design ideal caps to stabilize {B6H6} core in inverse sandwiches using group 13 elements as caps. Optimal ring&#8208;cap overlap makes AlH and GaH as nearly ideal caps for B6H6 ring. Estimates of aromaticity of HEB6H6EH using NICS is comparable to that of benzene, justifying the borozene nomenclature.







Abstract
The ubiquitous chemistry of benzene led us to explore ways to stabilise analogous borozene, by capping them with appropriate groups. The mismatch in overlap of ring&#8208;cap fragment molecular orbitals in [(HB)2B6H6]2&#8722; is overcome by replacing the two BH caps with higher congeners of boron. We calculated the relative energies of all the polyhedral structural candidates for [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8722; (E=Al&#8722;Tl) and found hexagonal bipyramid (HBP) to be more stable with Al&#8722;H caps. A global minimum search also gives HBP as the most stable structure for [Al2B6H8]2&#8722;. The capped B6H6 ring in [(HAl)2B6H6]2&#8722; has aromaticity comparable to that of benzene.

         <title>Front Cover: Uncovering Factors Controlling Reactivity of Metal&#8208;TEMPO Reaction Systems in the Solid State and Solution  (Chem. Eur. J. 54/2024)</title>

Who's pulling the strings? The Front Cover shows the structures of two TEMPO complexes with Et2Zn and Et(Cl)Zn in two different conformations. The first hinders the attack of the Et radical; the second facilitates it. Steric hindrance is highlighted by green umbrellas. The hands visible in the image symbolise the collaboration of experimental and theoretical work on the analysis of the studied reaction systems. The curtains, on the other hand, show that so far the picture of reactivity of the metal&#8208;TEMPO reaction system has not been fully elucidated, although our work has, at least partially, unveiled it. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kubas, J. Lewinksi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401968).

         <title>Cover Feature: Clathrate Hydrates as a Kind of Promising Ice Nanoreactors (Chem. Eur. J. 54/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clathrate hydrates (CHs) are promising nanoreactors that can convert CO2 to HCOOH under the function of H&#8208;bonds including the confinement effect and proton pumping, and trapped electrons. The seagulls flying to and getting caught in the water cages illustrate the confinement effect of CHs on CO2. The seaweed carried by the seagulls represents the trapped electrons, which interact with CO2. The ocean currents show protons in H&#8208;bonds. The dolphins in the sea mean HCOOH that is converted from CO2. Because CHs are widely distributed in the sea, so the cover image is set against a blue ocean background. More information can be found in the Review by Y. Bu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402197).

Redox reactions involving net 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ processes are key in chemistry. Molecular models are crucial for studying parameters related to these reactions. Newly reported ruthenium complexes modulate the thermochemistry of 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ transfers. This image illustrates how the electrons&#8217; and protons&#8217; crossing of the bridge could be affected by the electron&#8208;withdrawing strength of the X&#8208;substituent on the bipyridine ligand.

         <dc:description>
A novel design of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes with stabilities of up to 7&#8197;V through the incorporation of fluoroether linkers into pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids is reported. Site&#8208;specific fluorination allows a high ionicity to be reached, and thus the performance of those novel electrolytes is improved. This synergetic effects lead to thermally stable and nonflammable ionic liquid electrolytes. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Marinow, W.&#8197;H. Binder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402004).

         <title>Carbon Dots in Photodynamic Therapy: The Role of Dopant and Solvent on Optical and Photo&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to outstanding optical properties and biocompatibility, carbon dots (CDs) have been extensively gaining attention as a photo&#8208;responsive inducer for cancer photodynamic therapy. This review summarizes the synthesis and modification techniques of CDs that offer red&#8208;shift properties toward stronger fluorescence emission and deeper penetration of light&#8208;responsive reactive radical species generated at the laser&#8208;directing site that cause specific cell damage. The strategies summarized in this review could contribute to addressing the challenges in targeted cancer therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are novel carbon&#8208;based luminescent materials with wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing, bioimaging, drug transportation, optical devices, and beyond. Their advantageous attributes, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, antioxidant activity, photostability, small particle size (&lt;10&#8197;nm), and strong light absorption and excitation across a broad range of wavelengths, making them promising candidates in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as photosensitizers (PSs). Further enhancements in functionality are imperative to enhance the effectiveness of CDs in PDT applications, notwithstanding their inherent benefits. Recently, doping agents and solvents have been demonstrated to improve CDs&#8217; optical properties, solubility, cytotoxicity, and organelle targeting efficiency. These improvements result from modifications to the CDs&#8217; carbon skeleton matrices, functional groups on the surface state, and chemical structures. This review discusses the modification of CDs with heteroatom dopants, dye dopants, and solvents to improve their physicochemical and optical properties for PDT applications. The correlations between the surface chemistry, functional groups, the structure of the CDs, and their optical characteristics toward quantum yield, redshift feature, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, have also been discussed. Finally, the progressive trends for the use of CDs in PDT applications are also addressed in this review.

         <title>Clathrate Hydrates as a Kind of Promising Ice Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clathrate hydrates possess a variety of unique features, including the confinement effect of H&#8208;bonding nanocages, H&#8208;bond catalysis and proton/hydrogen sources, ability to enhance molecules&#8217; electron&#8208;binding and stabilizing the trapped electrons, which make clathrate hydrate promising nanoreactors.







Abstract
Since their discovery, clathrate hydrates (CHs) have received great attention both from theoretical and experimental aspects due to their great potential for gas storage and prospective applications as icy crystal materials. However, there has been limited research on the decomposition, reduction or other reactions of gases enclosed in CHs. Thanks to their unique hydrogen bonding network and cavity structures, CHs can serve as the promising nanoreactors to achieve chemical conversions, e.&#8201;g. reducing greenhouse gases. In this review&#8208;type article, we characterize the potential performance of such CHs nanoreactors by discussing their multiple functions including important roles of hydrogen bonds in CHs, e.&#8201;g. the confinement effect and proton source, and then discuss the enhanced electron&#8208;binding ability of guest molecules and the structures and properties of trapped electrons in the stacked nanocages, which contribute to our understanding of chemical reactions occurring in CHs. Finally, we provide detailed analyses of representative reaction mechanisms underwent in CH nanoreactors and effective calculational and molecular dynamics simulation methods. This review&#8208;type article aims to provide a detailed summary about the functional characteristics of CHs and reactivity in CHs, which make CHs a kind of promising icy nanoreactors.

         <title>Waste Valorization in a Sustainable Bio&#8208;Based Economy: The Road to Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important developments, over the last five decades, towards realization of sustainable chemicals manufacture, are discussed. They include the use of waste biomass and CO2 as a raw material, renewable electricity as the energy source and chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis, with whole cells or cell&#8208;free enzymes, including the use of electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis, as the facilitators.







Abstract
The development of sustainable chemistry underlying the quest to minimize and/or valorize waste in the carbon&#8208;neutral manufacture of chemicals is followed over the last four to five decades. Both chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis have played an indispensable role in this odyssey. in particular developments in protein engineering, metagenomics and bioinformatics over the preceding three decades have played a crucial supporting role in facilitating the widespread application of both whole cell and cell&#8208;free biocatalysis. The pressing need, driven by climate change mitigation, for a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, has precipitated an energy transition based on decarbonization of energy and defossilization of organic chemicals production. The latter involves waste biomass and/or waste CO2 as the feedstock and green electricity generated using solar, wind, hydroelectric or nuclear energy. The use of waste polysaccharides as feedstocks will underpin a renaissance in carbohydrate chemistry with pentoses and hexoses as base chemicals and bio&#8208;based solvents and polymers as environmentally friendly downstream products. The widespread availability of inexpensive electricity and solar energy has led to increasing attention for electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis which in turn is leading to myriad innovations in these fields.

         <title>The Strategies Towards Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 54, September 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical generation of aryl radicals from various precursors has attracted significant attention due to their high reactivity in forming multiple chemical bonds. This review summarizes recent advancements by categorizing the aryl radical precursors into five key types: (1) aryl diazonium salts, (2) aryl halides, (3) aryl (sulfonyl)hydrazines, (4) aryl quaternary arylammonium salts, and (5) other aryl radical precursors.







Abstract
The advancement in electrochemical techniques has unlocked a new path for achieving unprecedented oxidations and reductions of aryl radical precursors in a controlled and selective manner. This approach facilitates the construction of aromatic carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds. In light of the green merits and the growing importance of this technique in aryl radical chemistry, this review aims to provide an overview of the recent advance in the electrochemical generation of aryl radicals organized by the aryl radical precursor type, with a focus on the substrate scope, limitation, and underlying mechanism, thereby inspiring future work on electrochemical aryl radical generation.

Merging of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis has attracted increasing attention as they offer new catalytic processes to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. This review summarizes the recent achievements of NHC/transition metal dual catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial metallonucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic agent. This review introduces concepts core to this area such as DNA structure, AMN design, and cleavage mechanisms. We also describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities.







Abstract
Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as DNA molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic with high clinical potential. This review provides a primary level of exploration on the concepts key to this area including an introduction to DNA structure, function, recognition, along with damage and repair mechanisms. Building on this foundation, we describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide molecular scissors with enhanced or sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities. As this research field continues to evolve, understanding the applications of AMNs along with synthetic conjugation strategies can provide the basis for future innovations, particularly for designing new artificial gene editing systems.

         <title>Applications of Electrophotocatalysis in C&#8722;H Functionalization of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry and photochemistry join forces in the booming field of electrophotocatalysis. Electrophotocatalytic activation is suitable to engage even previously inaccessible compounds in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herin we provide an overview of recent developments in this field.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) has evolved as a new scientific discipline around the boundary of highly active fields: electrochemistry and photocatalysis. EPC allows us to combine the energy of light and electric potential to activate previously inaccessible compounds via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Herein, we review the most essential applications of EPC to the C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules. This work discusses mechanisms that can be encountered when designing such processes and analyzes technical aspects of performing EPC reactions in the laboratory.

         <title>Ca/Li Synergetic&#8208;Doped Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to Realize P2&#8208;O2 Phase Transition Suppression for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxide Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is considered as a promising cathode for advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the P2&#8208;type cathode suffers severe P2&#8208;O2 phase transition during cycling process, resulting unsatisfactory cyclic stability and rate capability. Herein, a Ca/Li co&#8208;doped P2&#8208;type Na0.62Ca0.05Ni0.33Mn0.57Li0.10O2 (NCNMLO) cathode material was synthesized through a simple sol&#8208;gel method. With the synergistic effect of Ca&#8208;doping at Na sites and Li substitution at transition metal (TM) sites, the cathode achieves an excellent electrochemical performance due to the inhibited P2&#8208;O2 phase transition and improved ion diffusion with Na+/vacancy disordering arrangement. The NCNMLO cathode exhibits a good cyclic stability with 70.8% of capacity retention at 1 C after 200 cycles and excellent rate capability with 40.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C. The dual sites doping strategy provides an effective and simple approach for designing high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;dependent Metallosupramolecular Polymerization Regulated by Ligand Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding structure/property correlations in self&#8208;assembly is a key but challenging requirement for developing functional materials. Herein, we explore the importance of ligand geometry to tune photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited states) and self&#8208;assembly pathways in metallosupramolecular polymerization. To this end, we have designed two hydrophobic Pt(II) complexes, 1 and 2, containing a &#960;&#8208;extended bidentate bipyridine ligand with different substitution pattern, resulting in different molecular geometries (linear vs V&#8208;shaped). Detailed comparative studies revealed significant differences for both complexes in terms of their photophysical properties and self&#8208;assembly pathways in non&#8208;polar media. The V&#8208;shaped topology of 1 enables facile face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking with a certain curvature leading to luminescent spherical assemblies exhibiting MMLCT states and short Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt contacts via a single&#8208;step cooperative pathway. On the other hand, the higher preorganized linear topology of complex 2 induces a two&#8208;step competitive self&#8208;assembly process leading to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers with slipped packing and MLCT&#8208;originated emission. Our findings broaden the monomer scope for supramolecular polymerization and provide design guidelines for the realization of luminescent supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Synthesis of C20&#8208;epi&#8208;Isothiocyanato&#8208;Salinomycin and Its Thiourea Derivatives as Potential Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salinomycin, a naturally occurring polyether ionophore antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus, has been demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity against a variety of cancer cell lines. In particular, it exhibits selective targeting of cancer stem cells. However, systemic toxicity, drug resistance and low bioavailability of the drug significantly limit its potential applications. In this study, the C20&#8208;epi&#8208;isothiocyanate of salinomycin was designed and synthesized, and then reacted with amines as a versatile synthon to assemble a series of salinomycin thiourea derivatives, which improved the druggability of salinomycin. The antiproliferative activities of the compounds were evaluated in vitro against A549, HepG2, Hela, 4T1, and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines using the CCK&#8208;8 assay. The pharmacological results showed that some salinomycin thiourea derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested tumor cells and high selectivity. Further mechanistic studies showed that compound 9f, containing a 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzyl moiety, could directly induce apoptosis, probably by increasing caspase&#8208;9 protein expression and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase in a concentration dependent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Crystalline Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Surfactant Complex with Chiral Supramolecular Structure and Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal with a helical structure and tunable CPL was fabricated by a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation. This material exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and a helical structure without inherent chirality. Chiral solvation imparts TPE&#8208;DHAB with a preferred handedness, enabling tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) when using a chiral solvent.







Abstract
A novel room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal of tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;DHAB) was synthesized using an ionic self&#8208;assembly strategy. The TPE&#8208;DHAB complex exhibits typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties and a unique helical supramolecular structure. Moreover, the generation and handedness inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) can be achieved through further chiral solvation, providing a facile approach to fabricate room&#8208;temperature liquid crystalline materials with controllable supramolecular structures and tunable CPL properties through a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation process.

         <title>Inhibition of Lysosomal Cathepsin A and Neuraminidase 1 Interaction by Anti&#8208;Obesity Cyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stylissatin A and its analogs are shown to inhibit the interaction between mature protective protein cathepsin A and neuraminidase 1 in lysosomes, which caused irregular proteolysis of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation in adipocytes. This PPI&#8208;modulating effect is promising to develop anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drug leads.







Abstract
Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novel small molecules targeting adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation offer potential for new anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drugs. Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein&#8211;protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Active Lone Pairs Induced Second Harmonic Generation Responses and Electrocatalytic Activity in Hybrid Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid material, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8901;H2O was successfully synthesized. Both theoretical analysis and experimental data have confirmed the crucial role of the 4s lone pair electrons of the Ge atom in inducing SHG response and electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable s2 lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis. While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional material incorporating Ge with 4s2 lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8208;H2O (MeHDabco=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1). Driven by the stereochemically active lone pair electrons on the Ge2+, 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21 at room temperature and exhibits good second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Interestingly, 1 also shows electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the existence of lone pair electrons on Ge2+ cations. The electrochemical experiment combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the lone pair electrons act as both an active site for proton adsorption and facilitate the ionization of water. This work not only emphasizes the important role of lone pair electrons in material properties and functions but also provides new insight for designing novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid materials.

&lt;p&gt;A novel Ge-based multifunctional hybrid material, (MeHDabco)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[GeBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was successfully synthesized.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis. While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic-inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic-inorganic hybrid multifunctional material incorporating Ge with 4&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[GeBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (MeHDabco=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;).

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and characterized by their anti&#8208;amyloid potential. We investigated compound structure relationship for inhibiting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down the A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Structural Deformations in Cucurbit[n]urils: Analysis, Host&#8208;Guest Dependence, and Automated Ellipticity Measurements Using ElliptiCB[n]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We report development and use of ElliptiCB[n], which provides automated measurements of cucurbituril ellipticities. We also include a detailed analysis of all prior crystallographically characterized CB[5,6,7,8,10] hosts







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are cyclic macrocycles with rich host&#8208;guest chemistry. In many cases, guest binding in CB[n]s results in host structural deformations. Unfortunately, measuring such deformations remains a major challenge, with only a handful of manual estimations reported in the literature. To address this challenge, we have developed the public program ElliptiCB[n], which is available on GitHub, that provides a robust and automated method for measuring the elliptical deformations in CB[n] hosts. We outline the development and validation of this approach, apply ElliptiCB[n] to measure the ellipticity of the 1113 available CB[n] structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and directly investigate the structural deformations of CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10] hosts. We also report the general landscape of accessible CB[n] elliptical deformations and compare ellipticity distributions across CB[n] hosts and host&#8208;guest complexes. We found that in almost all cases guest binding significantly impacts the distribution of host ellipticity distributions and that these distributions are dissimilar across host&#8208;guest complexes of differently sized CB[n]s. We anticipate that this work will provide a useful approach for understanding of the flexibility of CB[n] hosts and will also enable future measurement and standardization of ellipticity measurements of CB[n]s.

         <title>N&#8208;Halosuccinimide&#8208;CeCl3 Transient Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes as Semi Heterogeneous Photocatalyst in Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>

In this work, photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride formed a transient charge&#8208;transfer complex with NXS (X=Br, I) in acetonitrile, acting as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. This facilitated Ce(III) ion light absorption, creating halide radicals that converted N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes. Experiments confirmed a single electron transfer pathway. The CeCl3 was reusable with minimal decomposition.







Abstract
In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.

         <title>Magnetic Chitosan/ZrO2 Composites for Vanadium(V) Adsorption while Concurrently being Transformed to a Dual Functional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composite material (MZT) adsorbent for V(V) adsorption. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole and enhanced natural photocatalytic degradation Rhodamine B. The study proposes a resourceful, effective method for repurposing waste via natural photocatalytic reactions leveraging clean energy, potentially contributing to environmental preservation and presenting innovative avenues for spent adsorbent recovery.







Abstract
Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, yielding up to 89.7&#8201;%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3&#8201;% and 97.4&#8201;% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251&#8197;nm and 561&#8197;nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;Earth Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The graphic depicts RE&#8208;CU&#8208;45, a rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic framework, which features 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid linkers and hexanuclear RE(III) clusters (RE(III)=Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III), Yb(III), Lu(III), and Y(III)). The MOF linker can be excited at 290&#8197;nm and, through the antenna effect, promote energy transfer to the RE(III) ions, leading to emission in the visible and/or near&#8208;infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.







Abstract
In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE=Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesize new push&#8211;pull compounds characterized by naphthalimide as electron acceptor and by different electron donors such as tetraphenylethylene, triphenylamine and phenothiazine. Our time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic results show that TADF is occurring in the yellow and orange&#8211;red ranges of the visible. Fluorescence quantum yields are surprisingly large, triggered by the conjugation enhancement achieved through the synthetic effort.







Abstract
In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film. The weight of the Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) is greatly enhanced when these fluorophores are used as guests in solid&#8211;state host matrices. TADF is interestingly revealed in the orange&#8211;red region of the visible. Such long wavelength emission is here observed with surprisingly large fluorescence quantum yields, thanks to the conjugation enhancement achieved in these newly synthesized structures relative to previous studies. Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural parameters are known to govern covalent polymer mechanochemistry, but the complexity increases when chemically different chains are linked by covalent bonds, as in block copolymers (BCPs). This review highlights studies trying to define structure&#8208;activity relationship in the mechanochemistry of BCPs in various states, with an emphasis on the influence of their morphologies.







Abstract
Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8722;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.

         <dc:description>
A mild and facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite leading to organic nitrate esters has been developed at room temperature in air. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds smoothly to afford the corresponding organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air the green oxidant.







Abstract
A simple and efficient strategy has been developed for the synthesis of organic nitrate esters via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite under open air atmosphere. This transformation could be conducted under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions to provide a number of organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air as the green oxidant.

(&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers are prepared as a new motif from tosylate 3. The motif has a preferred &#8216;propellar&#8217; conformation which can adopt left or right handed twists. LogP's are lower than tert&#8208;butyl analogues. Interactions between TFNP groups in the solid state are shown to also anchor supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
A route is developed to (&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8722;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their neopentyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Oxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides and oxamates yields N&#8208;aryloxamates in moderate to excellent yields, especially when oxamates bear bulky tertiary alkyl groups. These oxamates are hydrolyzed to oxamic acids, then converted into urethanes using PIDA or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Chemically Programmed Amphiphiles into Aqueous Nanotubes with a Lipophilic Lumen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel nanotubes of ca. 4&#8197;nm in diameter self&#8208;assembled in water from custom&#8208;tailored amphiphiles are able to selectively encapsulate apolar molecules within their lipophilic lumen.







Abstract
The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.

         <dc:description>The alkylation of 3&#8208;/4&#8208;bromo&#8208; and &#8208;iodopyridine with methyl triflate smoothly affords the corresponding&#160;N&#8208;methylpyridinium triflate salts. An anion exchange with NaI or [PPh4]Y (Y = Cl, Br, I) yields the corresponding halide salts. Most of them could be structurally characterized and their strong halogen bonds were investigated. While the halogen atom of 4&#8208;halogenopyridinium is susceptible to nucleophilic substitution, 3&#8208;halogenopyridinium ions are far more stable against nucleophilic attacks. Due to the comparable interaction strength of halogen bonds and hydrogen bonds, the latter of which is widely used in chromatography, the potential of 3&#8208;halogenopyridinium moieties for an application in chromatography is obvious and was&#160;successfully employed in affinity chromatography of different&#160;proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Sugars to Lactic Acid using homogeneous Niobium&#8208;substituted Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic conversion of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals is an increasing field of research. This study uniquely investigates the use of various Keggin&#8208;type heteropoly salts (HPS) for the chemical conversion of sugars into lactic acid under mild conditions of 160&#176;C and 20 bar N2. In the first phase, Nb&#8208; and V&#8208;substituted HPSs were employed to synthesize lactic acid from dihydroxyacetone, an intermediate in the conversion of sugars to lactic acid. Results indicated that increasing the Nb content within the Keggin structure enhances the yield of lactic acid while reducing the formation of the byproduct acetaldehyde. A correlation was established between the redox activity of the HPS and the catalytic performance. The most active catalyst, Na5[PNb2Mo10O40], (NaNb2) achieved a lactic acid yield of 20.9% after 1 h of reaction. In the second phase of the study, NaNb2 was applied for the conversion of different sugars including glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose, xylose, and cellobiose. It was demonstrated that the catalyst remains active for complex hexoses, achieving lactic acid yields of up to 12%. Post&#8208;mortem analysis using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) confirmed the stability of NaNb2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the synthesis of heptacene in 2006, the race to obtain and study the properties of largest acenes resulted in the development of innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to on&#8208;surface chemistry. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of large acenes, up to tridecacene, highlighting the newest studies.







Abstract
Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of large acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.

         <title>Tetrel Bond Affects the Self&#8208;Assembly of Acetylcholine and its Analogues and is an Ancillary Interaction in Protein Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical findings show that the C atoms of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety of acetylcholine and some analogues form tetrel bonds that are robust enough to assemble cations into supramolecular infinite chains; similar tetrel bonds are present also in substrate/protein adducts, specifically they act as ancillary interactions in the binding of these &#8722;N+(CH3)3 containing compounds to proteins.







Abstract
The &#8722;N+(CH3)3 residue is present in acetylcholine (ACh) and in many of its analogues which are used as selective ACh agonist or antagonists for human therapy. The X&#8208;ray structures of four ACh derivatives show the presence of short and linear contacts between the C atoms of &#8722;N+(CH3)3 groups and lone pair possessing atoms. These contacts can be rationalized as tetrel bonds (TtBs) thanks to their geometric features. Interrogation of the Protein Data Bank suggests that similar &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts affect the details of the binding of ACh and its derivatives to proteins. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction plot, and natural bond orbital analyses consistently confirm that the &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts observed in small molecule crystals and in substrate/protein complexes are attractive in nature and can be rationalized as TtBs. TtBs involving methyl groups of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety can be proposed as a new item in the palette of interactions allowing the compounds containing this pharmacophoric unit to bind to their target protein and/or to express their biological/pharmacological properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleosidic diarylethenes was modified in three different ways by varying the connection between nucleoside and thiophene subunit with the aim of shifting the absorption wavelength of open (&#955;max,UV) and closed forms (&#955;max,Vis). A 5&#8208;uridine&#8208;2&#8208;thiophene connection (semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes) resulted in a red shift of &#955;max,UV and blue shift of &#955;max,Vis. Resulting switches showed remarkable reversibility and fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs&#8211;semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96&#8201;% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.

         <title>What Determines the Lewis Acidity of a Bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;Based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures and reactivities of (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiX2 (X=Cl, I, C2F5) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. It turned out that the construction of functional Lewis acidic sites based on neutral bismuthanes requires substituents with a high ionic character and electronegativity, and at the same time they should not contain atoms in &#945;&#8208;position or lone pairs that are capable of undergoing effective negative hyperconjugation.







Abstract
Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8722;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital.

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple model to explain the preferred geometry for tricoordinate pnictogen pincer complexes is proposed based on competing &#960; and &#963; effects to make sense of the variable structures reported in the literature.

Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.

&lt;p&gt;A simple model to explain the preferred geometry for tricoordinate pnictogen pincer complexes is proposed based on competing &#960; and &#963; effects to make sense of the variable structures reported in the literature.

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium incorporation onto already electron&#8208;deficient benzene diimides is demonstrated here. In the solid state, these compounds engage in interesting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions and H&#8722;bonding patterns. Injection of electrons is facile (ca. &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) and results in species with NIR absorption maxima (&#955;max up to 821&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8211;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8211;water H&#8722;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.

         <dc:description>
A novel series of vinylene bridged heteroaryls is presented and studied by computational methods. Calculated structural and optoelectronic properties are discussed in order to identify viable molecular designs. Notably, one candidate exhibits a narrow band gap, longer absorption wavelengths, low BLA and reorganization energy. These findings suggest its potential use as a precursor of advanced conjugated materials for organic electronics.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers are of great importance for the fabrication of organic photonic and electronic devices. To this end, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers need to meet both optoelectronic and key structural properties in order to fulfill their implementation as active components. In particular, they need to possess low bandgap and high thermal, conformational, and photochemical stabilities. So far, several strategies have been developed to attain such requirements including the covalent and non&#8208;covalent rigidification concepts of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. On the basis of these findings, we describe herein the theoretical studies of novel series of covalently bridged derivatives demonstrating the benefits of the strategy. Comparison of these derivatives with compounds previously described in the literature highlights enhanced optoelectronic properties and behaviors that would be beneficial for the construction and development of new linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligands: Evaluating the Role of Acidic Protons in the Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ancillary NH groups contained within ligands can participate in reactions through metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. Substitution of the NH moiety by NMe or O can be used in the evaluation of its role. This study investigates how such substitutions also affect the electronics and the binding strengths of the ligand.







Abstract
To evaluate bifunctional ligand reactivity involving NH acidic sites in the secondary coordination sphere, complexes where the proton has been substituted with a methyl group (NMe) are often investigated. An alternative strategy involves substitution of the NH group for an O. This contribution considers and compares the merits of these approaches; the synthesis and characterization of cationic square&#8208;planar Rh carbonyl complexes bearing diprotic bispyrazole pyridine ligand L1, and the bis&#8208;methylated pyrazole pyridine ligand L1Me are described. The syntheses and characterization of the novel monoprotic pyrazole isoxazole pyridine ligand L2 and aprotic bisisoxazole pyridine ligand L3, and their corresponding Rh carbonyl complexes are also described. Comparison of the CO stretching frequencies of the four Rh complexes suggest that substitutions of NH with NMe, as well as with O, lead to significant electronic differences. These electronic differences result in different reactivities with respect to ligand addition/substitution of the Rh carbonyl complexes. Overall, the data suggest that electronic differences arising due to the NH substitutions can be significant and should be considered when the NH group is substituted in investigations of the participation of the NH proton in a reaction.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>

A series of novel luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is reported. The design concept is based on merging of cyanostilbenes with guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrroles yielding hybrid luminophores, capable to undergo photoisomerization and are able to be used in biomedical imaging.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.

         <title>Formation and Stability of Benzylic&#160;Amide&#160;[2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes: an Intercomponent Interactions Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide&#8208;benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide&#8208;benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. Including the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two&#8208;station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole&#8208;carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide-benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide-benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole-carbonyl station. Including the triazole-carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two-station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC-XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole-carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole-carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Electrochemical Construction of Csp2&#8208;Csp2 Linkage at C5&#8208;C5&#8217; Position of 2&#8208;Oxindoles via an Intermolecular Anodic Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applying electricity as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has attracted particular attention from synthetic chemists worldwide as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective technique. Herein, we report the construction of the Csp2&#8208;Csp2 linkage at the C5&#8208;C5&#8242; position of 2&#8208;oxindole utilizing electricity as the traceless oxidant in an anodic dehydrogenative homo&#8208;coupling process. A variety of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles were subjected to dimerization, achieving yields of up to 70% through controlled potential electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.5 V versus Ag/Ag+ nonaqueous reference electrode. This electro&#8208;synthetic approach facilitates the specific assembly of C5&#8208;C5&#8242; (para&#8208;para coupled) dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole without the necessity of any external oxidants or additives and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations provided confirmation of this pronounced regioselectivity. Furthermore, validation through control experiments and voltammetric analyses substantiated the manifestation of radical&#8208;radical coupling (or biradical pathway) for the dimerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Aryl Ketones Involving Free Phenolic Hydroxyl Group(s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward asymmetric transfer hydrogenation for accessing enantiomerically enriched secondary benzyl alcohols involving free phenolic hydroxyl group(s) under mild conditions was developed. Various of optical pure aryl alcohols with a remarkable functional group compatibility were achieved with 78%&#8211;97% yields, 84%&#8211;&gt;99% ee&#8217;s and up to 10 000 TON. This rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction could be performed in a gram&#8208;scale without loss of the efficiency. Furthermore, the synthetic utility has also been demonstrated in the asymmetric synthesis of (S)&#8208;adrenaline and (S)&#8208;phenylephrine.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Hyperconjugation and Hydrogen Bonding on the Conformers of Methylated Monosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational landscapes of four 1&#8208;O&#8208;methylated monosaccharides&#8212;methyl a&#8208;glucose, methyl b&#8208;glucose, methyl a&#8208;galactose, and methyl b&#8208;galactose&#8212;were characterized using jet&#8208;cooled broadband rotational spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations. A newly designed, simple pulsed nozzle assembly was used to introduced the sugar samples into a jet expansion without thermal degradation, eliminating the need for a complex and expensive laser ablation system. Ten conformers were experimentally identified by assigning their rotational spectra, and the intricate methyl internal rotation splittings were analysed. Notably, methylation alters the directionality of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of a&#8208;galactose highlighting its impact on structural preference. Natural bond orbital, intrinsic bond strength, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses were conducted to explore the interplay between hydrogen bonding and hyperconjugation. A set of &#963; to &#963;* neutral hyperconjugative interactions were found to override a strong hydrogen bond, driving a preference for the gauche conformers.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol (CBD) is garnering increasing interest due to its significant biological activity. This natural compound is one of the major cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. In this work, we describe the encapsulation of CBD in solid and hollow pH&#8208;sensitive poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (solid@p4VP and hollow@p4VP) nanoparticles, and temperature&#8208;sensitive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (solid@pNIPAM and hollow@pNIPAM) nanoparticles for transport and release CBD in a controlled manner. The CBD loading into these smart polymeric systems was effective and their release profiles, solubility and resistance to stomach and intestinal conditions were evaluated, showing satisfactory properties and improved bioavailability with respect to free CBD. Finally, the A549 human lung cancer cell line was used as lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cellular model to carry out preliminary assays of the in vitro activity of the vehiculized CBD. For all these studies, synthetic CBD was employed, for which a new efficient and scalable synthesis of cannabinoids has been developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Alkynyl Ketones and Amides to Generate Unsaturated Oxacycles and Aromatic Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe novel amine&#8208;mediated transformation of alkynyl ketones and amides to generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. These cascade processes are initiated by conjugate addition of secondary amine followed by hydrolysis of the enamine/vinylogous amide intermediates. The product distribution is highly sensitive to the steric and electronic effects of the substituents on both the alkyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine. Alkynyl amide participates in the Alder&#8208;ene reaction favorably to generate more reactive allene amide that reacts with amine to generate amine&#8208;incorporated arene products. These metal&#8208;free cascade reactions are a useful synthetic method that can be exploited for the construction of various hetero&#8208; and carbocyclic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Divergent Synthesis of a 13&#8208;Ring Triquinone and its Facile Conversion to a [4.4.4]Tridecastarphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes are notable for their optoelectronic properties. Starphenes are structurally related molecules possessing three acene arms that radiate linearly from a central benzene ring (i.e., linearly annellated triphenylenes). Large starphenes have been prepared using convergent syntheses involving transition metal catalyzed cyclotrimerizations of either preformed acenes or arynes. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that readily converts to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative. The one&#8208;pot procedure involves the sequential reactions of three 1,4&#8208;anthraquinones with o&#173;&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives that are generated sequentially from a trisulfone precursor. The resulting [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative bearing p&#8208;(t&#8208;butyl)phenyl substituents was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry,&#160;differential pulse voltammetry and DFT calculations. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high&#8208;lying HOMO orbital (about &#8208;4.70 to &#8208;4.86 eV) and a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.1 eV), suggesting utility as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene photooxidizes in CH2Cl2 solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half&#8208;life of 150 minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12 months in the solid&#8208;state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene shows excellent solubility in various organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.</dc:description>

The resulting [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative bearing p-(t-butyl)phenyl substituents was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and UV-vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry,&#160;differential pulse voltammetry and DFT calculations. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high-lying HOMO orbital (about -4.70 to -4.86 eV) and a relatively small HOMO-LUMO gap (2.1 eV), suggesting utility as a p-type organic semiconductor. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene photooxidizes in CH2Cl2 solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half-life of 150 minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12 months in the solid-state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene shows excellent solubility in various organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction for the construction of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acid derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs), which are pivotal components in natural metabolism and pharmaceutical innovation, continues to attract significant research interest. Despite substantial advancements, the pursuit of a facile, versatile, and resource&#8208;efficient methodology remains an area of active development. In this work, we introduce a visible light&#8208;triggered three&#8208;component reaction involving readily available nitrosoarenes, N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles, and allyl or (bromomethyl)benzenes under mild conditions. This approach enables the straightforward assembly of a wide array of ATAA derivatives (41 examples) in commendably high yields (up to 89%). Mechanistic investigations elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a dehydration condensation between nitrosoarenes and N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles to generate ketimine intermediates. This is followed by a light&#8208;driven halogen atom transfer (XAT) process and a radical addition, culminating in the formation of the desired products. The approach showcases excellent functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage derivatization potential, offering new insights and avenues for the synthesis of ATAA analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Deoxycyclophellitols as Human Retaining &#946;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophellitol is a potent and selective mechanism&#8208;based retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor that has served as a versatile starting point for the development of activity&#8208;based glycosidase probes (ABPs). We developed routes of synthesis of eight mono&#8208; and dideoxycyclophellitols and cyclophellitol aziridines, the latter as ABPs carrying either a biotin or fluorophore linked to the aziridine nitrogen. We reveal the potency of these 24 compounds as inhibitors of the three human retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases, GBA1, GBA2 and GBA3. We show that 3,6&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galacto&#8208;cyclophellitol aziridine selectively captures GBA3 over GBA1 and GBA2 in extracts of cells overexpressing both GBA2 and GBA3. We also identify a probe that selectively labels GBA1 and GBA2 over GBA3 at lower concentrations. In sum, the here&#8208;presented studies reveal new chemistries to prepare chiral, substituted cyclitol epoxides and aziridines, add to the growing suite of cyclophellitols varying in configuration and substitution pattern, and yielded a reagent that may find use to investigate the physiological role and therapeutic relevance of the most elusive of the three retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases: GBA3.</dc:description>

         <title>Migration of para&#8208;Nitrophenyl Groups in Methyl Pyranosides: Configuration and Conformation Determine the Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>para&#8208;Nitrophenyl (PNP) ethers of glycosides are important building blocks en route to functional carbohydrates. They are stable in neutral media, however, under basic conditions such as during the Zempl&#233;n deacylation of sugars, aryl migration is frequently observed. We have employed a library of O&#8208;PNP&#8208;substituted methyl glycosides of the manno&#8208;, galacto&#8208;, gluco&#8208; and altro&#8208;series to study the kinetics of aryl migration in MeOH/sodium methoxide using NMR spectroscopy revealing that migration between cis&#8208;oriented OH groups is faster than between trans&#8208;oriented ones. The rate constants of migration decrease in the order of Alt &gt; Man &gt; Gal &gt; Glc and are related to the energy barriers of chair conformation inversion. The energy profile of the 3 to 4&#8208;PNP migration in methyl mannoside was calculated using DFT methods suggesting the Meisenheimer complex is an intermediate of PNP migration and that coordination of the sodium cation has a major impact on the energy profile.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot procedure with cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded the chiral cyclic hexamer of naphthylene, [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene (1). The molecular structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR analyses, revealing its cyclic structure with an approximate D3 symmetry. Compound 1 exhibits blue emission at 383 nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which can be attributed to its rigid twelve&#8208;membered ring structure. Optical resolution of 1 by chiral HPLC allowed for the evaluation of its chiroptical properties. Each enantiomer exhibits circular dichroism with complex Cotton effects, which are grouped into three positive or three negative couplets. Circularly polarized luminescence is observed at 383 nm with an anisotropy factor |glum| on the order of 10&#8211;4. The high photoluminescence quantum yield and the CPL properties of 1 indicate its potential application as a CPL emitter.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;Pentatomic Heterobiaryl Diamines by an Organocatalytic Arylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of axially chiral biaryl diamines has been widely acknowledged as highly advantageous structures for the advancement of chiral catalysts and ligands. This highlights their extensive range of applications in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis. Herein, we devised a direct arylation reactions of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with azonaphthalenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as the catalyst. This method delivers structurally novel atroposelective N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;azole heteroaryl diamines with high yields (up to &gt;98%) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios while exhibiting a wide range of substrate compatibility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are crucial for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes, which have wide&#8208;ranging implications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. However, since NCIs are relatively weak and sensitive to bulk perturbation, direct and accurate measurement of their absolute strength has always been a significant challenge. This concept article aims to demonstrate the gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization (ESI)&#8208;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe nature of NCIs, and reveal the electronic structural information for host&#8208;guest complexes. Our recent studies in investigating various host&#8208;guest complexes that involve various types of NCIs such as anion&#8211;&#960;, (di)hydrogen bonding, charge&#8208;separated ionic interactions, are overviewed.

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: On the Role of Local Charge Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular simulation models unravel the local charge profile of substrate&#8208;supported nanoparticles in contact to ionic liquid molecules &#8211; thus providing structural and electronic insights to nanosystems used in (electro&#8722;)catalyses. While quantum approaches are limited to comparably small systems, we demonstrate the application of the QEq method for bridging time and length scales significantly. This enables molecular simulation studies for exploring the self&#8208;organization of ionic liquid and reactant molecules on supported nanoparticle models.







Abstract
Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10&#8197;nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8722;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Selective Fluorescence Sensing of Mg2+ and Al3+ Ions by Pincer&#8208;Type NNO Schiff Base Ligand: An Experimental and DFT Optimized Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A newly developed dual&#8208;functional fluorescence sensing probe (phenylhydrazinyl pyridine) Schiff base (SB) has been designed with good selectivity for distinguishing Mg2+ and Al3+ metal ions in different solvent solutions. SB exhibits quick and visual turn&#8208;on fluorescence enhancement in response to Mg2+ and Al3+ detection. The addition of Mg2+ in ACN&#8211;HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.2) at (&#955;max = 390 nm) and&#160;Al3+ in MeOH&#8211;HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.2) at &#160;(&#955;max = 360 nm) resulted in significant enhancement of fluorescence, up to 7 &#8208; 9 times. These low detection limits of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8208;6 M (7.1 &#956;M) and 5.15 &#215; 10&#8208;7 M (0.51 &#956;M) for Mg2+ and Al3+, respectively, have been achieved by this solvent&#8208;controlled platform. Due to the sensing potential towards Mg2+, the probe was utilized as an imaging material for breast cancer cells. 1H&#8208;NMR studies were utilized to explore SB's sensing mechanism through turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to validate optimized SB and its intricate geometries, which govern the sensing mechanism in the solvent environment. Such a probe has extensive potential applications in bioimaging and the assessment of the quality of wastewater.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing precision polymers using four methods &#8211; solid&#8208;phase synthesis, liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, DNA&#8208;template synthesis, and controlled polymerization &#8211; precision polymers with special properties in thermodynamics and crystalline performance have been achieved.

Abstract
In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science &#8211; a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ongoing search for a cheap and fluorine&#8208;free alternative for perfluorinated sulfonic acid&#8208;polymers (PFSAs), we investigate a set of novel copolymers combining sulfonamide and sulfonimide functionalities. The materials show outstanding conductivities of up to 283&#8197;mS&#8201;c&#8722;1, high thermal stability over 250&#8201;&#176;C and easy manufacturing. On top they contain many possibilities for variation, giving them promising prospects as a new class of ionomers.







Abstract
In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg=151&#8201;&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#8201;&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963;=283&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

         <title>In situ Reconstructured Alloy Nanosheets Heterojunction for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ reconstruction process fabricates the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction while preserving the two&#8208;dimensional morphology. The synergistic effect of Cu and Sn active sites stabilizes the *OCHO intermediate, thereby facilitating efficient electrocatalytic formate production. The designed Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction demonstrates outstanding CO2RR performance, showcasing its potential for practical applications in sustainable energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu&#8322;O@Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; heterojunction. Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu&#8322;O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium fluoride (LiF) serves as a modified additive, which can enhance the electrochemical performance in SiOx anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with LiF modified. The addition of LiF can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer, reduce the volume expansion, and enhance the Li+ diffusion coefficient.







Abstract
Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as a promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commercial applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity, large volume expansion, and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low initial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and short cycling lifespan. In this work, we demonstrated a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with lithium fluoride (LiF) modified. When the mass ratio of SiOx and LiF equaled 1&#8201;:&#8201;0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention could be greatly improved from 30.1&#8201;% to 76.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. The result was primarily because of the enhancement of electrons and Li+&#8208;ions transport and the stability of the SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition could hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presented the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx anode materials for LIBs.

         <title>Bipyramidal Nanocrystals of Noble Metals: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers bipyramidal nanocrystals of noble metals, with a focus on the roles played by reduction, etching, and capping in their nucleation and growth. It also discusses how to control the exposed facets, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation, as well as their effects on plasmonic properties and catalytic applications.







Abstract
Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.

         <title>Benzodifuranone Crystals with Solid&#8208;State Emission Arising from the Introduction of Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved benzodifuranone crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission achieved through the introduction of bulky aromatic groups. In addition to the unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.







Abstract
Benzodifuranone derivatives, structural analogues of widely studied diketopyrrolopyrrole, have been reported to show photoluminescence exclusively in solution states. Here, upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone dyes, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds. In addition to the solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed responsivity to external stimuli, i.&#8201;e., luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.

         <title>50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so&#8208;called selenoxide elimination.&#160; While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long&#8208;standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non&#8208;toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Alcohols to Carbonyls under Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl derivatives has been realized under photoelectrochemical conditions in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as the homogeneous photocatalyst. The protocol can be applied to both primary and secondary, benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The desired products are obtained selectively, skipping the need for purposely added chemical oxidants. An in&#8208;depth study of photoelectrochemical conditions revealed that the protocol works best under amperostatic conditions in an undivided electrochemical cell irradiated with a 390 nm LED lamp. The comparison with analogous electrochemical and chemical oxidant&#8208;promoted photocatalytic oxidations demonstrates the superior efficiency and selectivity of the hereby reported photoelectrochemical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Potent Antiviral Activity of the Sesterterpenoids from the Sponge Ircinia felix against Human Adenoviruses: from the Natural Source to the Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections.&#160;Ircinia felix&#160;sponge was selected for the significant anti&#8208;HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three&#160;novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J&#8208;L, along with three known sesterterpene furans&#160;which structures&#160;were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Some structure&#8208;activity relationships were deduced. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J&#160;targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell. The first total synthesis of ircinialactam J was also accomplished to prove the structure and to provide access to analogues. Key steps are a regio&#8208; and stereoselective construction of the trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin at &#916;7&#160;by iron&#8208;catalyzed carbometallation of a homopropargylic alcohol, a stereoselective methylation to generate the stereogenic center at C18, and the formation of the (Z)&#8208;&#916;20&#160;by stereoselective aldol condensation to introduce the tetronic acid unit. Ircinialactam J is a promising antiviral drug against HAdV infections.</dc:description>

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluorooxetane &#8211; A Versatile Functional Group for Bioisosteric Replacements in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group (FG) is one of the cornerstone concepts in organic chemistry and related areas. The wide spread of bioisosterism ideas in medicinal chemistry and beyond caused a striking rise in demand for novel FGs with a defined impact on the developed compound properties. In this work, the evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;difluorooxetane unit (3,3&#8208;diFox) as a functional group for bioisosteric replacements is disclosed. A comprehensive experimental study (including multigram building block synthesis, quantification of steric and electronic properties, measurements of pKa, LogP, chemical stability, and biological evaluation of the 3,3&#8208;diFox&#8208;derived bioisostere of a drug candidate) revealed a prominent behavior of the 3,3&#8208;diFox fragment as a versatile substituent for early drug discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>The fabrication of ZIF&#8208;L derived ZnS/MoS2@NC anode materials for remarkable lithium&#8208;ion storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement of electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries can be achieved through the incorporation of MoS2 with carbon materials and various metal sulfides. In this investigation, a MoS2/ZnS heterostructure was devised incorporating a two&#8208;dimensional nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (NC) backbone. The synthesis of ZnMo&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L precursors was achieved by introducing a Mo source in a 1:1 molar ratio during ZIF&#8208;L synthesis. Subsequent to high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance. At a current density of 500 mA g&#8208;1, the initial discharge specific capacity is 2547 mAh g&#8208;1, with an initial charge specific capacity of 1674 mAh g&#8208;1, resulting in a first Coulombic efficiency of 65.76%. Furthermore, this composite material demonstrates optimal rate capabilities and a significant pseudocapacitance contribution. The nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon framework effectively mitigates volume effects, while the heterostructural design provides more active sites for lithium ions, thereby enhancing lithium storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>100 &#956;s Luminescence Lifetime Boosts the Excited State Reactivity of a Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Anthracene Complex in Photon Upconversion and Photocatalytic Polymerizations with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The triplet excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer is an essential parameter for diffusion&#8208;controlled energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer, which occurs usually in a competitive manner to the intrinsic decay of a triplet excited state. Here we show the decisive role of luminescence lifetime in the triplet excited state reactivity toward energy&#8208; and electron transfer. Anchoring two phenyl anthracene chromophores to a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex (RuII ref) leads to a RuII triad with a luminescence lifetime above 100 &#956;s, which is more than 40 times longer than that of the prototypical complex. The obtained RuII triad sensitizes energy transfer to anthracene&#8208;based annihilators more efficiently than the RuII ref and enables red&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion with a pseudo anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.94 eV and a moderate upconversion efficiency near 1% in aerated solution. Particularly, the RuII triad allows rapid photoredox catalytic polymerizations of acrylate and acrylamide monomers under aerobic condition with red light, which are kinetically hindered for the RuII ref. Our work shows that excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer governs the dynamics of the excited state reactions, which seems an overlooked but important aspect for photochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>IPr*F &#8211; Highly Hindered, Fluorinated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atom has attracted considerable interest in molecular design owing to the high electronegativity and the resulting polarization of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds. Simultaneously, sterically&#8208;hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to high stabilization of the reactive metal centers, which has paved the way for the synthesis of stable and reactive organometallic compounds with broad applications in main group chemistry, inorganic synthesis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we report the first class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These ligands feature variable fluorine substitution at the N&#8208;aromatic wingtip, permitting to rationally vary steric and electronic characteristics of the carbene center imparted by the fluorine atom. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. The evaluation of steric, electron&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as well as coordination chemistry to Au(I), Rh(I) and Se is presented. Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nonribosomal Peptides Chitinimides Reveal a Special Type of Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and their tailored enzymes have diverse biological functions. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis and function of chitinimides, which belong to the non&#8208;ribosomal peptide (NRP) subfamily featuring a pyrrolidine&#8208;containing part (X part) connected to the polypeptide chain via an ester bond. A conserved gene cassette, chmHIJK, is responsible for oxyacylation of the pyrrolidine moiety in the X part. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ChmC (ChmC&#8208;TE) catalyzes transesterification reactions with a free X part or methanol as a nucleophilic reagent to form different chitinimides. The crucial amino acid residues in the ChmC&#8208;TE domains responsible for the specific recognition of the X part were identified, and they were conserved in all the biosynthetic pathways of this NRP subfamily to form a signature motif, YNHNR, suggesting a special type of TE domain in NRPSs. Chitinimides demonstrate the biological function of promoting the swarming ability of the native producer. This study provides deep insights into the biosynthesis of this special NRP subfamily, and shows that the special TE domain could be used to generate diverse NRPs by combinatorial biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 100 to 103 M&#8722;1, exhibiting a bell&#8208;shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the pKa values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent&#8217;s steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi&#8208;static stability with only 1% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week&#8208;long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day&#8208;to&#8208;week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salts Derived from Sulfur Hexafluoride as Deoxyfluorination Reagents</title>

Sulfur hexafluoride valorization with phosphines affords crystalline phosphonium SF5&#8722; salts that are used as deoxyfluorination reagents.







Abstract
Sulfur based deoxyfluorination reagents are usually derived from the corrosive gas SF4. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of an easily accessible phosphonium salt [(tmg)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (1) which was obtained from the reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine. The performance of this crystalline SF5&#8722; salt as a reagent in deoxyfluorination reactions was investigated together with a second SF5&#8722; salt [(R1)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (2) containing bulky substituents (R1=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino). Both reagents proved to be effective for the deoxyfluorination of various functional groups including alcohols, anhydrides, and amides.

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties With Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new model to describe and fit the behavior of diffusion coefficients (D) as a function of molecular structure and thermodynamic parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules. The model is validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a series of n&#8208;alcohols, revealing a strong dependence of D on molecular shape and solute&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

         <title>Improved Electrochemical Peptide Synthesis Enabled by Electron&#8208;Rich Triaryl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) phosphine enable the electrochemical synthesis of peptides which are difficult with the previously reported method using triphenyl phosphine. In addition, this phosphine has a potential to be a recyclable coupling reagent. This study also presents that substituents on phosphines influence the reactivity of phosphine (radical) cation and have an important role in avoiding side reactions.







Abstract
While remarkable progress has been made in the development of peptide medicines, many problems related to peptide synthesis remain unresolved. Previously, we reported electrochemical peptide synthesis using a phosphine as a potentially recyclable coupling reagent. However, there was room for improvement from the point of view of reaction efficiency, especially in the carboxylic acid activation step and the peptide bond formation step. To overcome these challenges, we searched for the optimal phosphine. Among phosphines with various electronic properties, we found that electron&#8208;rich triaryl phosphines improved the reaction efficiency. Consequently, we successfully performed electrochemical peptide synthesis on sterically hindered and valuable amino acids. We also synthesized oligopeptides that were challenging with our previous method. Finally, we examined the effect of substituents on the phosphine cations, and gained some insights into reactivity, which will aid researchers designing reactions involving phosphine cations.

         <title>Cobalt Nanoparticles Catalyzed N&#8208;Heterocycles Synthesis via Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst derived from MOFs/SiO2 composite was prepared using a one&#8208;step assembly process involving pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity in the synthesis of quinoline and pyridine derivatives through acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols.







Abstract
The acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction is a sustainable and atom&#8208;economical methodology in organic synthesis, resulting in the byproducts of only hydrogen or water. Herein, a robust Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst (derived from ZIF@SiO2 composite) has been synthesized through a one&#8208;step assembly process via pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst has been employed for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols, enabling efficient conversion of various substrates into desired quinoline or pyridine derivatives with a yield of up to 94&#8201;%.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient modification of microparticles with cobaltocenium moieties is described by taking advantage of a hydroamination reaction with a metal&#8208;containing acetylene derivative. The high accuracy of this technique opens the way to tailored stimuli&#8208;responsive spheres showing reversible redox&#8208;addressability over high cycling numbers. The herein&#8208;presented metallopolymer&#8208;based particles can also be converted to porous ceramics.







Abstract
Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.&#8201;e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.

         <title>Mapping Electrophile Chemoselectivity in DalPhos/Nickel N&#8208;Arylation Catalysis: The Unusual Influence of Remote Sterics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose herein our evaluation of competitive (hetero)aryl&#8208;X (X: Br &gt; Cl &gt; OTf) reactivity preferences in bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling catalysis, using furfurylamine as a prototypical nucleophile, and employing DalPhos and DPPF as representative ancillary ligands with established efficacy. Beyond this general (pseudo)halide ranking, other intriguing structure&#8208;reactivity trends were noted experimentally, including the unexpected observation that bulky alkyl (e.g., R = tBu) substitution in para&#8208;R&#8208;aryl&#8208;X electrophiles strongly discourages (pseudo)halide reactivity relative to smaller substituents (e.g., nBu, Et, Me), despite being both remote from, and having a similar electronic influence on, the reacting C&#8208;X bond; such effects on nickel oxidative addition have not been documented previously and were not observed in our comparator reactions presented herein involving palladium. Density functional theory modeling of such PhPAd&#8208;DalPhos/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings revealed the origins of competitive turnover of C&#8208;Br over C&#8208;Cl, and possible ways in which bulky para&#8208;alkyl substitution might discourage net electrophile uptake/turnover, leading to inversion of halide selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The addition of Grignard reagents to ketones is a well&#8208;established textbook reaction. However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism has only recently begun to emerge. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, because of its high selectivity and sensitivity, is the ideal tool for distinguishing between an ensemble of competing pathways.&#160;With this aim in mind, we investigated the concerted mechanism of the addition of methylmagnesium chloride (CH$_3$MgCl) to acetone in tetrahydrofuran by simulating the X&#8208;ray spectra of different molecules in solution. We used electronic structure methods to calculate the X&#8208;ray absorption spectra at the Mg K&#8208; and L$_1$&#8208;edges and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra at the Mg K&#8208;edge for different organomagnesium species, which coexist in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium.&#160;The simulated spectra show that individual species can be distinguished throughout the different stages of the reaction.Each species has a distinct spectral feature which can be used as a fingerprint in solution. The absorption and photoelectron spectra consistently show a blue shift as the reaction progressed from reagents to products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Example of a Gallium&#8208;based Lewis Superacid: Synthesis and Reactivity of Ga(OTeF5)3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Lewis superacid Ga(OTeF5)3 has been synthesized and characterized, revealing a monomeric structure in solution and a dimeric structure in the solid state. Isolated adducts of Ga(OTeF5)3 with strong and weak Lewis bases have been characterized spectroscopically as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The Lewis acidity of this new species has been evaluated by means of different experimental and theoretical methods, which has allowed to classify it as one of only a few examples of a gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity of Ga(OTeF5)3 was used to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5, leading to the protonation of diethyl ether. Furthermore, Ga(OTeF5)3 was utilized to access the strong oxidizing system Ga(OTeF5)3/Xe(OTeF5)2 in SO2ClF, which was successfully employed in the synthesis of the dimethyl chloronium salt [Cl(CH3)2][Ga(OTeF5)4], a strong electrophilic methylation reagent.</dc:description>

Isolated adducts of Ga(OTeF5)3 with strong and weak Lewis bases have been characterized spectroscopically as well as single-crystal X-ray diffractometry. The Lewis acidity of this new species has been evaluated by means of different experimental and theoretical methods, which has allowed to classify it as one of only a few examples of a gallium-based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity of Ga(OTeF5)3 was used to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5, leading to the protonation of diethyl ether. Furthermore, Ga(OTeF5)3 was utilized to access the strong oxidizing system Ga(OTeF5)3/Xe(OTeF5)2 in SO2ClF, which was successfully employed in the synthesis of the dimethyl chloronium salt [Cl(CH3)2][Ga(OTeF5)4], a strong electrophilic methylation reagent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The reaction of [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)] with chlorotrimethylsilane leads to the selective substitution of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms and thus to the formation of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)]. The corresponding chlorogallate ion, [Ga(CCl2CF3)3Cl]&#8211;, could be isolated and structurally characterized as its tetraphenylphosphonium salt. The catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] was demonstrated via the chlorodefluorination of Me3SiCF3, 2,2&#8208;difluoropropane and [PPh4][Ga(C2F5)4].</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Coordination Engineering on Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C Materials for Oxygen Reduction: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial coordination engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to regulate the catalytic performance of metal&#8210;N&#8210;C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN4&#8210;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN4 center. Specially, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant&#8208;potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH = 1, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 possesses an impressive theoretical half&#8208;wave potential of ~1.01 V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts (~0.88 V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN4&#8210;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>An imine&#8208;functionalized silicone&#8208;based epoxy coating with stable adhesion and controllable degradation for enhanced marine antifouling and anticorrosion properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofouling and corrosion of submerged equipment caused by marine organisms severely restrict the rapid development of the marine industry. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine&#8208;functionalized command&#8208;degradable bio&#8208;based epoxy coating (SAHPEP&#8208;DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3&#8208;bis (3&#8208;aminopropyl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51&#8208;DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP&#8208;DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of &#8208;C=N&#8208; and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si chain segments in the cross&#8208;linking network. The coating&#160;shows promising resistance against bacteria, algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater. The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments. Moreover, its controlled degradation after&#160;failure can be achieved in acid aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, facilitated by the presence of &#8208;C=N&#8208;. This work presents a novel degradable coating successfully coupled the dual functions of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings, avoiding the employment of intermediate coat, indicating vast potential for application in&#160;marine engineering fields.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient and practical method was developed for the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol ligands. The disclosed synthesis involves the Ullmann homocoupling of a keto bromo&#8208;pyridine under NiCl2/Zn/PPh3 conditions, followed by the stereoselective double hydrogen transfer to the obtained 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;diketone using RuII Noyori&#8211;Ikariya catalysts. This approach allowed the successful synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol, i.e (S,S)&#8208;Bolm's ligand, with a quantitative yield and an excellent stereoselectivity (ee&gt;99.5&#8201;%, de&gt;99.5&#8201;%), with an overall yield of 69&#8201;% from easily accessible starting materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), as non&#8208;canonical DNA structures, attract a great deal of research interest in the molecular biology as well as in the material science fields. The use of small molecules as ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes has emerged as a tool to regulate gene expression and telomeres maintenance. Meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) was shown as one of the first ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes and it is still widely used. We report an investigation comprising molecular docking and dynamics, synthesis and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations on simple cationic porphyrins and their interaction with different DNA sequences. The study allowed to synthesize a few compounds that have shown to interact with DNA; the detailed characterization has shown that the presence of amide groups at the periphery improves selectivity for parallel G4s binding over other structures. Taking into account the ease of synthesis, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin bromide could be considered a better alternative to TMPyP4 in studies involving G4 binding.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrosynthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles from N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole is a widely encountered motif in the areas of pharmaceuticals, materials, and agrochemicals. This work has established a mild, mediated electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones. Using DABCO as the optimal redox mediator has enabled a mild oxidative cyclisation, without recourse to stoichiometric oxidants. In contrast to previous methods, this indirect electrochemical oxidation has enabled a broad range of substrates to be accessed, with yields of up to 83%, and on gram scale. The simplicity of the method has been further demonstrated by the development of a one&#8208;pot procedure, directly transforming readily available aldehydes and hydrazides into valuable heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates &#8211; Steric Bulk Increases the Reaction Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine&#8208;based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction. Here, we show that the peptide H&#8208;Mep&#8208;dPro&#8208;dGlu&#8208;NH2, which is reluctant to under alkylation,&#160;catalyzes this reaction at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8211;1 mol%) within short reaction times (15&#8211;60 min) to yield a broad range of &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes with high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with conjugated organic polymers by rational modulation of donor, acceptor and bonding method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal&#8208;free catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals is very challenging. Here, we synthesized a conjugated organic polymer (TpTf&#8208;1) featuring 2,4,6&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triazine as the acceptor unit, triphenylamine as the donor unit, and vinylidene bond as the linkage. The local structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) forms an intramolecular electric field that can promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and charges, meanwhile, the vinylidene bond can further change the charge distribution to promote exciton dissociation. Without the use of photosensitizers, the TpTf&#8208;1 exhibits outstanding selectivity of CO of up to 91.96%, with a production rate of 45.2 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at visible light, which is 3.4&#8208;fold than TaTf&#8208;1 with the same D&#8208;A structure but linking in imine bond and is 2.8&#8208;fold than TpTf&#8208;2 linking in vinylidene bond but with a different donor unit. Moreover, TpTf&#8208;1 has a CO production rate of up to 117.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under full wavelength light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff Base Chemistry with Multidentate Acyclic Ligands and Transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first two neptunyl&#8208;pyrrophen compounds. Formerly synthesized with uranyl, these unique hexadentate ligands readily coordinate equatorially with neptunyl ions. The crystal structure is determined, and diffuse reflectance and FTIR spectra are measured. Scrutiny is placed on the NpO2L1 compound which is determined to exist as a mixed valence species of Np(V/VI).







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state,. As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5&#8201;f electron participation and coordination.

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity to synthesize complex protein conjugates functionalized with two or more distinct moieties has revolutionized the field of chemical biology. This review summarizes contemporary chemical biology tools for protein dual chemical modifications, along with the discussion of their respective advantages, limitations, and potential future directions within this rapidly evolving area.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple modifications of proteins are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modification of proteins is inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for dual functionalization of proteins. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Single-site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure-activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy-consuming Haber-Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six-electron, six-proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N-fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Contrary to this, much harder-to-reduce N-fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CoNHF(PE)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single-site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutral and Anion Species of Quinoidal Thienothiophene Diketopyrrolopyrroles Display a Common Aggregation Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrol quinoidal oligomers aggregate in a very similar way in the neutral state and in the dimer dianion states due to an uniform distribution of the electron charge excess between the two molecules in the dimer dianion.







Abstract
A comprehensive investigation of two new molecular triads incorporating the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit into a quinoidized thienothiophene skeleton, which is further end&#8208;capped with dicyanomethylene (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;CN) or phenoxyl groups (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;PhO), has been carried out. A combination of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations has been used. The main result is the formation of similar H&#8208;aggregates in the dimerization process of the neutral molecules and of the charged anionic species. The experimental absorption spectra of the aggregated species are accurately reproduced by quantum chemical calculations using the Spano's model, including excitonic coupling for the dimeric forms and full vibronic resolution of the absorption bands. The strong excitonic coupling taking place is key to understand the electronic structure of the dimeric species and has been instrumental to disentangle the type of H&#8208;aggregation. This study is of relevance to get a better understanding of the molecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores and is useful as a guideline for the refinement of the engineering of molecular materials for which supramolecular design is required.

         <title>Tuning The Intracellular Distribution of [3+2+1] Iridium(III) Complexes In Bacterial And Mammalian Cells By iClick Reaction With Biomolecular Carriers Functionalized With Alkynone Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The colour and intracellular distribution of iridium(III) complexes is tuned by iClick conjugation of different biomolecular carriers&#8221;. The iClick (inorganic click) reaction enables a modular modification of iridium(III) complexes with ancillary triazolato ligands carrying biological targeting groups like biotin and cholic acid. The stability and non&#8208;toxicity of these compounds facilitates their use as biological imaging probes in bacterial and human cancer cells. Their intracellular localization can be tuned by proper peripheral functionalization of the complexes.







Abstract
Three iridium(III) triazolato complexes of the general formula [Ir(triazolatoR,R&#8217;)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6 with ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine and terpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine were efficiently prepared by iClick reaction of [Ir(N3)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6, with alkynes and alkynones, which allowed facile introduction of biological carriers such as biotin and cholic acid. In contrast to the precursor azido complex, which decomposed upon photoexcitation on a very short time scale, the triazolato complexes were stable in solution for up to 48&#8197;h. They emit in the spectral region around 540&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 15&#8211;35&#8201;% in aerated acetonitrile solution and exhibit low cytotoxicity with IC50 values &gt;50&#8197;&#956;M for most complexes in L929 and HeLa cells, demonstrating their high suitability as luminescent probes. Cell uptake studies with confocal luminescence microscopy in prokaryotic Gram&#8208;positive S. aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli bacteria as well as eukaryotic mammalian L929 and HeLa cells showed significant uptake in particular of the cholic acid conjugates iridium(III) moiety and distinct intracellular distribution modulated by the nature of the peripheral functional groups that can easily be modified by the iClick reaction.

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodonitrene (ArI=NR) is a highly reactive species that is commonly employed in a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction and skeletal editing for generating N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene intermediates has recently emerged as a powerful strategy in modern synthesis. In this review, we address the rapidly expanding field of nitrene insertion, which includes skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, the use of hypervalent iodine compounds to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and our present understanding of the process.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was rationally optimized to minimize deleterious protodeboronation side&#8208;product in Cu&#8208;mediated 19F&#8208; and 18F&#8208;fluorination of arylboronic acids. Fluoride anion is activated through a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) effect under ligandless conditions featuring a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2. This mild protocol occurs at lower temperature and demonstrates improved generality with good yields and radiochemical conversions and minimal protodeboronation.







Abstract
Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in&#8197;vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure, with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent, to activate fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30&#8197;minutes at a temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39&#8201;% to 84&#8201;% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17 and 54&#8201;% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P, N co&#8208;doped carbon has been used as cathode materials in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The high battery performance is ascribed to the high adsorption energy toward NaO2 of this advanced cathode materials. The high adsorption energy of NaO2 can prevent NaO2 from decomposing into hard&#8208;to&#8208;decompose Na2O2 during discharging and thus increase the battery efficiency during the cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36&#8197;V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption (&#8722;2.85&#8197;eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8722;1.80&#8197;eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported in comparison with the empty C360 and C362&#8722; cages. Among all [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6 6] C&#8722;C bonds the [5&#8208;5] bond is the most reactive bond in both the empty C36 and metallofullerene M@C36.







Abstract
Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8722;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by lowering the LUMOs of the cage, hence maximizing the orbital interactions.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Synthesis Planning (CASP) and Machine Learning: Optimizing Chemical Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the topic of the Computer Aided Synthesis Project (CASP) and gives a detailed overview of the methods of machine learning to predict chemical reaction conditions, including the problem of data and descriptor selection, the indicators for the evaluation of results and the current research progress of various algorithms. The future research trends and possible challenges in chemical condition prediction are prospected.







Abstract
Computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) has garnered increasing attention in light of recent advancements in machine learning models. While the focus is on reverse synthesis or forward outcome prediction, optimizing reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. For datasets with multiple variables, the choice of descriptors and models is pivotal. This selection dictates the effective extraction of conditional features and the achievement of higher prediction accuracy. This review delineates the origins of data in conditional optimization, the criteria for descriptor selection, the response models, and the metrics for outcome evaluation, aiming to acquaint readers with the latest research trends and facilitate more informed research in this domain.

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster&#8211;Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool for the glycosciences: A heterobivalent glycocluster combines two photoswitchable azobenzene glycoside antennas with different photochromic properties. Hence, wavelength&#8208;selective E/Z isomerization of the glycoantennas is enabled and a switching cycle comprising three major isomers (EE, EZ, ZZ). Kinetic analysis explains the relaxation mechanism and MD simulations illustrate the relationship between isomeric state and distance between the sugar ligands.







Abstract
Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. In order to advance the possibilities of such an &#8220;optoglycomics&#8221; approach for the glycosciences, we have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.

Gearing up double&#8208;decker complexes. A prototype of a molecular gear has been synthesized in 12 steps, using a helical naphthalocyanine ligand as rotating cogwheels and a thioether octa&#8208;functionalized phthalocyanine as anchoring stator.







Abstract
This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2&#8201;%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55&#8201;%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper studies the process of eco&#8208;friendly microwave assisted synthesis of a material based on triazine compounds and the possibility of its use as part of a hybrid catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under mild conditions by the NO3RR reaction.







Abstract
This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is a major contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. By reconstituting R&#8208;CI into artificial membrane vesicles and in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, the effects of ROS are investigated. The activity of R&#8208;CI is reduced because of ROS, not only by damaging the enzyme but also by making the membrane more polar and protic.







Abstract
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CPL signal direction of cyclodextrins&#8208;pyrene co&#8208;assembly can be regulated through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;induced stacking transformation, demonstrating that (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;CPL of pyrene&#8208;pyrene excimer is originated from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformation in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.







Abstract
Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenon of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and scalable synthesis of sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, is achieved under aerobic conditions, at ambient temperature, in reusable choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. The interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the selected DESs drives the sulfonamide synthesis over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides.







Abstract
A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and ChCl/urea (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), these reactions yield up to 97&#8201;% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12&#8197;h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure's eco&#8208;friendliness is validated by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.

         <dc:description>
Valence isomers of benzene have long attracted both synthetic and theoretical chemists due to their unique bonding and chemical reactivity. What new chemistry can be unlocked by introducing isosteric boron and nitrogen atoms in these structures? This concept paper highlights the recent development of boron(B)&#8208;nitrogen(N)&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers, specifically, BN&#8208;Dewar benzene and BN&#8208;benzvalene.







Abstract
Benzene is one of the most ubiquitous structural motifs in chemistry. The valence isomers of benzene have also attracted synthetic chemists&#8217; attention due to their unique structures, bonding, and reactivity. We have been investigating boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers via photoisomerization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines. In this contribution, we summarize recent developments of these highly strained BN&#8208;heterocyclic compounds including their synthesis, characterization, proposed mechanism of formation, and their potential applications.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Donepezil: A Green and Sustainable Strategy Featuring Heterogeneous Catalysis and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical, sequential, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil was developed using inexpensive precursors. Key elements included highly functional heterogeneous catalytic processes for condensation and hydrogenation, with water as the sole byproduct. Additionally, in&#8208;line treatments eliminated inhibitory factors, enabling seamless integration of the multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow reactions.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease, was accomplished using inexpensive, commercially available precursors. This achievement was made possible by reconfiguring the synthetic route to include only heterogeneous catalytic addition and condensation reactions, with a particular emphasis on skeletal transformation and bond formation through hydrogenation processes. Notably, water was the sole byproduct in this synthesis. A crucial aspect of this work was the development of appropriate continuous&#8208;flow processes to achieve a one&#8208;flow synthesis. This was accomplished by implementing in&#8208;line treatments of the main reaction stream to eliminate inhibitory factors that could affect catalyst performance in the hydrogenation steps.

&lt;p&gt;An atom-economical, sequential, and continuous-flow synthesis of donepezil was developed using inexpensive precursors. Key elements included highly functional heterogeneous catalytic processes for condensation and hydrogenation, with water as the sole byproduct. Additionally, in-line treatments eliminated inhibitory factors, enabling seamless integration of the multi-step continuous-flow reactions.
