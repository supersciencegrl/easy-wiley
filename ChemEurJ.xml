         <title>Fluorescent Chromophore Construction via Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Caprolactam and Itaconic Acid: Mechanistic Validation Enabled by 3D&#8208;Printed Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic fluorescent colloids are formed by thermally driven hydrogen bonding between CPL and ITA. Disrupting the hydrogen bonds within the system by 3D printing quenches the fluorescence, which enables applications as fluorescent materials. The colloids can be used as sustainable, low&#8208;cost alternatives to aromatic systems.








Abstract
Fluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam (CPL) and itaconic acid (ITA) can produce a fluorescent&#8208;colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining noncrystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf&#8208;like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via &#960;&#8208;electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in under achievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focusses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides towards capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides along with future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue TADF Emission from Multiheteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Embedded with Dual B&#9472;O Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel TADF emitter with a multiheteroatom PAH skeleton featuring dual B&#9472;O covalent bonds instead of isolated boron atoms was reported. BNB&#8208;OPTZ was synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free method in over 80% yield. The emitter exhibits deep blue emission at 441&#160;nm in toluene, with CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). OLEDs based on BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a maximum EQE of 23.1%, demonstrating the potential of B&#9472;O covalent bonds&#8208;embedded PAHs for high&#8208;performance blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#9472;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom&#8208;doped molecule, BNB&#8208;OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free methodology, achieving an impressive one&#8208;pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB&#8208;OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi&#8208;planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long&#8208;range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441&#160;nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#9472;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom&#8208;doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH&#8208;based blue&#8208;light OLED applications.

         <title>Nanosecond Hyperquenching for Electron Cryo&#8208;Microscopy Without Air&#8208;Water Interface Artifacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for the ultrafast vitrification of the biological assemblies is assayed by the electron cryotomography. Protein specimens prepared by this method inherently lack the spatial/structural artifacts, which derive from the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Mitigating the effect of AWI artifacts is the major challenge for the high&#8208;resolution (time&#8208;resolved) electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) imaging.







Abstract
A major challenge in electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) imaging is preparing the protein specimen without the artifacts caused by the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Here, we report nanosecond hyperquenching (NHQ) &#8211; a method of preparing ECM samples without AWI&#8208;bound protein macromolecules. The fast narrow sample jet impinges the eutectic propane&#8208;ethane (PET) liquid cryogen at 77&#8197;K and breaks up, forming 30&#8211;150&#8208;nm&#8208;thick vitrified films. NHQ films with the protein particles are formed directly in the PET cryogen, precluding AWI tension&#8208;driven protein adsorption, preferred orientation, subunit dissociation and denaturation. The formed film surfaces are essentially specimen&#8208;free, with a 2.7&#8208;nm&#8208;thick protein depleted layer of hyperquenched glassy water (HGW). This &#8220;surface sealing&#8221; appears to be the first essential stage of vitrification at NHQ conditions; it occurs in about 35&#8197;ps on cryogen encounter. We outline the depletion mechanism, where the growing HGW layer displaces protein particles from the surface inwards the film.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate structure of ferrocene&#8208;water complexes has been unveiled using advanced rotational spectroscopy and computational methods. The nature of the noncovalent interactions at the two binding sites observed at ferrocene the exo &#960; cloud and the planar orbit around iron are unveiled. The nearly free rotational dynamics of water within these complexes is highlighted.







Abstract
The structure of the ferrocene&#8208;water ((Cp)2Fe:H2O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the exo Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary&#8208;like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)2Fe:H2O. For water interacting with the exo Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8722;11&#8197;kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.

The nature of the noncovalent interactions at the two binding sites observed at ferrocene the exo &#960; cloud and the planar orbit around iron are unveiled. The nearly free rotational dynamics of water within these complexes is highlighted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the ferrocene-water ((Cp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary-like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. For water interacting with the &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8722;11&#8197;kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective deprotonation capture sequence of tetrahydroquinolines with alkyl halides and aromatic halides at the 4&#8208;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands is described. Mechanistic and site&#8208;selectivity investigations revealed the active metalation species to be a separated ion pair of which allowed for common directing groups within the heterocyclic scaffold to be bypassed.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8208;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>
Complex engineering systems use actuators that convert primary forms of energy into mechanical motion, which enables precise and task&#8208;specific technical applications. The same principles apply to molecular machines. However, functionality is only achieved when the actuators interact with their environment in a controlled manner. The cover features an azo&#8208;based photoswitch that performs a well&#8208;defined, precise, wing&#8208;flapping motion with a huge motion amplitude of 9&#160;&#197;. The core system can be readily functionalized with a broad range of functional groups for various applications and further extension of the switching lever. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Herges and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500435).

         <title>Cover Feature: Nanosecond Hyperquenching for Electron Cryo&#8208;Microscopy Without Air&#8208;Water Interface Artifacts</title>

         <dc:description>
Partitioning of protein specimens to the air&#8211;water interface (AWI) poses an acute problem in electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM), causing a loss of biological function, subunit dissociation, protein denaturation and aggregation at the AWI with an insufficient number of visible molecular orientations. The outstanding method of ECM sampling&#8211;nanosecond hyperquenching (NHQ) solves this problem, yielding vitrified nanofilms without AWI&#8208;bound protein. The Research Article by U.&#160;H. Ermel, H. Schwalbe and A.&#160;V. Cherepanov (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403878) offers a detailed characterization of protein distribution in vitrified nanofilms and the mechanism of protein exclusion from AWI in terms of macroscopic shock&#8208;wave mechanics.

Rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry reveal axial and equatorial binding motifs in a ferrocene&#8211;water complex. For the axial arrangement, a two&#8208;dimensional energy surface displays a Mexican hat&#8208;like potential, allowing nearly free rotation of the water molecule. Moderately strong binding interactions subtly distort the ferrocene framework. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#160;C. L&#243;pez and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500128).

The epoxidation of ethylene to produce ethylene oxide is a vital heterogeneous catalytic chemical process in industry. In this review, we provide a systematical summary on the progress and achievements in ethylene epoxidation catalysis from a catalytic perspective along the development of structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts, with the target to present insights into providing guidance for the design of efficient and highly selective catalysts for heterogeneous epoxidation reactions, and to better understand their catalytic behaviors in a unified way.








Abstract
Epoxidation of ethylene to produce ethylene oxide (EO) is a vital heterogeneous catalytic chemical process in the industry, as EO is an important intermediate for the synthesis of fine chemicals including ethylene glycol, ethoxylates, plastics, and polyester. EO is commercially produced by the silver&#8208;catalyzed partial oxidation of ethylene with air or oxygen. However, it remains challenging to understand its chemical behavior under reaction conditions. To overcome this challenge, a series of catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been developed. The present review is devoted to summarizing the recent advances in the exploitation of novel catalytic materials for the epoxidation of ethylene, such as metal nanoparticles, clusters, single atoms, and bimetal. The role of promoters in selectivity enhancement will be discussed. A deep understanding of the active species, oxygen species, active structures, activity&#8208;structure relationship, and mechanisms contributing to the epoxidation process are highlighted. The integration with other advanced technologies such as electrocatalytic and photocatalytic is also reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects are provided so as to give guidance for the design of efficient catalysts for heterogeneous epoxidation of ethylene to EO, and to improve the fundamental understanding of the underlying catalytic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis provides sustainable and versatile methods for the synthesis and functionalization of chromene derivatives. This review compiles cutting&#8208;edge methodologies, highlighting transformations such as multicomponent reactions, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions, diverse cascade processes, and Giese&#8208;type additions. The integration of photochemistry with green principles enables more convenient and eco&#8208;friendly access to structurally diverse and biologically significant heterocycles.








Abstract
Chromenes represent a biologically significant family of heterocycles, widely present in pharmaceutical compounds and secondary metabolites. Their importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry has driven continuous efforts to develop advanced and efficient synthetic methodologies. Over the past decade, photoredox catalysis has revolutionized Organic Synthesis, offering innovative and sustainable strategies for the construction and functionalization of complex molecules. The synthesis of chromene derivatives has greatly benefited from the integration of visible&#8208;light&#8211;promoted methodologies, which utilize light as an abundant and non&#8208;toxic energy source, enabling greener chemical transformations. In this review, the latest progress in visible&#8208;light&#8211;mediated approaches for the synthesis of chromene derivatives, along with the photochemical reactivity of these relevant frameworks, are summarized.

         <title>Structure and Photoluminescence Properties of EuSiN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With EuSiN2 a novel Eu&#8208;nitridosilicate is presented including a very comprehensive structure description and a comparison with its related compounds MSiN2. A different way of displaying the structure as M&#8208;N polyhedra layers is introduced. The dark red luminescent EuSiN2 exhibits two clearly shaped luminescent peaks which present a novel feature for nitridosilicates.








Abstract
With the europium nitridosilicate, EuSiN2 a novel member of the multifaceted MSiN2 family is presented and compared with the structural similar compounds MSiN2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba). A different way of presenting the structure as M&#8208;N polyhedra layers is introduced. The crystal structure of EuSiN2, being isotypical to SrSiN2, was determined and refined based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group P21/c (no. 14) with a = 5.96381(2) &#197;, b&#160; = 7.25982(3) &#197;, c&#160; = 5.488338(19) &#197;, &#946; = 113.33&#176;, V&#160; = 218.18(5) &#197;3, and Z&#160; = 4. As the Eu2+&#8208;doped MSiN2 compounds show excellent luminescence properties as LED phosphors, the luminescence behaviour of dark red emitting EuSiN2 has been investigated as well. Two emission peaks are visible at 708&#160;nm and 764&#160;nm. Many europium&#8208;doped nitridosilicates show more or less developed shoulders for their luminescence peaks, but two clearly shaped emission peaks are a novel feature for nitridosilicates. Comprehensive and detailed comparisons are given and discussed based on works in literature.
The chromaticity coordinate positions of EuSiN2 in the CIE 1931 diagram are x = 0.678 and y = 0.284.

Efforts focus on enhancing photocatalyst accessibility and practicality. This study reports a self&#8208;assembled charge&#8208;transfer complex enabling green&#8208;light auto&#8208;photocatalysis. The process yields Z&#8208;selective products with 100% atom economy and minimal waste (E&#8208;factor 11.15). The product acts as its own photocatalyst, demonstrating a self&#8208;sustaining, efficient system aligned with green and sustainable chemistry principles.








Abstract
Efforts to enhance photocatalysts prioritize improving their accessibility and practicality in photocatalytic applications. Supramolecular (auto)photocatalysis, which exploits transient self&#8208;assembled complexes, facilitates visible light&#8208;driven reactions, with autocatalytic systems promoting sustainable and atom&#8208;economical processes. In this study, the photocatalyst Mes&#8208;Acr&#8208;MeClO4, typically active under blue light, formed a dark red charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with N&#8208;bromoacetamide (NBA) in the presence of K2CO3 in DCE, enabling green&#8208;light photocatalysis. This self&#8208;assembled CT complex initiated an auto&#8208;photocatalytic process via two&#8208;photon absorption, generating an N&#8208;centered radical that drove anti&#8208;Markovnikov, syn&#8208;periplanar addition to phenylacetylene, achieving exclusive Z&#8208;selective formation of (Z)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylvinyl)acetamide. Interestingly, the product itself functioned as a potent green&#8208;LED photocatalyst (&#955;em = 518&#160;nm, &#964; = 10&#160;ns), driving its own synthesis with added terminal alkynes. With 100% atom economy, this work highlights a system chemistry approach, showcasing a highly efficient, self&#8208;sustaining catalytic process that advances green and sustainable synthetic strategies. This protocol emphasizes sustainability with an outstanding E&#8208;factor of 11.15, reflecting minimal waste production (11.15&#160;kg per 1&#160;kg of product) and demonstrating a strong commitment to green chemistry principles.

APR&#8208;A, an aggregation&#8208;prone oligopeptide, can convert into APR&#8208;B through distinct mutational pathways&#8212;some exclusively forming insoluble amyloid&#8208;like peptides, others yielding water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;aggregating monomers. These orthogonal pathways in chemical evolution may have driven macromolecular assembly under prebiotic Earth conditions, potentially leading to biological function acquisition.








Abstract
Short amyloidogenic oligopeptides (APRs) are proposed as early macromolecules capable of forming solvent&#8208;separated nanosystems under prebiotic conditions. This study provides experimental evidence that APRs, such as the aggregation&#8208;prone oligopeptide A (APR&#8208;A), can undergo mutational transitions to form distinct variants and convert to APR&#8208;B, either amyloid&#8208;like or water&#8208;soluble and non&#8208;aggregating. These transitions occur along a spectrum from strongly amyloidogenic (pro&#8208;amyloid) to weakly amyloidogenic (anti&#8208;amyloid), with the mutation sequence order playing a key role in determining their physicochemical properties. The pro&#8208;amyloid pathway facilitates heterogeneous phase separation, leading to amyloid&#8208;crystal formation with multiple polymorphs, including the first class 3 amyloid topology. By mapping these transitions, we demonstrate the potential co&#8208;evolution of water&#8208;soluble miniproteins and insoluble amyloids, both of which could have been pivotal in early bio&#8208;nanosystem formation. These insights into amyloid modulation provide a crucial step toward understanding amyloid control mechanisms.

Two novel LnIII (Ln = DyIII and GdIII) nanoclusters ([Dy5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;4EtOH&#183;2CH3CN&#183;5H2O (1) and [Gd5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;5EtOH&#183;5CH3CN&#183;11H2O (2)) are prepared by regulating metal salts. Cluster 1 exhibits the characteristic slow relaxation property associated with single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). In contrast, cluster 2 shows low&#8208;temperature magnetic refrigeration characteristics and can serve as a typical T1&#8208;type magnetic resonance contrast agent.








Abstract
Rare earth clusters have demonstrated promising application prospects, owing to their distinctive topological structures and electronic configurations. Herein, two novel LnIII (Ln = DyIII and GdIII) clusters were synthesized using 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde and 1,1&#8208;di(hydroxymethyl)ethylamine, along with Dy(ClO4)3&#183;10H2O and Gd(ClO4)3&#183;10H2O, respectively named as [Dy5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;4EtOH&#183;2CH3CN&#183;5H2O (1) and [Gd5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;5EtOH&#183;5CH3CN&#183;11H2O (2). The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results indicated that clusters 1 and 2 possessed highly stable co&#8208;vertex double triangular metal skeletons, in which the LnIII spin centers form a triangular [Ln3O] cluster via &#956;3&#8208;OH. Magnetic studies revealed that cluster 1 exhibited the characteristic slow relaxation property associated with single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with an effective energy barrier (Ueff/kB) of 1.48 and 4.76 K under 0 and 2000&#160;Oe DC field, respectively. In contrast, cluster 2 showed low&#8208;temperature magnetic refrigeration characteristics (maximum &#8208;&#916;Sm = 9.76 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, &#916;H = 5 T at 2.0 K). In addition, cluster 2 exhibited an excellent longitudinal relaxation rate (r1) with 2.74&#160;mm&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at 0.5 T and a relatively suitable r2/r1 value (1.12), indicating that it can serve as a typical T1&#8208;type magnetic resonance contrast agent.

We report the fabrication of scrolled sheet and planar sheet structures from the self&#8208;assembly of laterally&#8208;grafted rod&#8208;coil molecules. The mono&#8208;grafted rod&#8208;coil self&#8208;assembles into a scrolled sheet which exhibits a thermal&#8208;responsive behavior. In contrast, the symmetrically&#8208;grafted rod&#8208;coil molecules form planar sheet structures that do not exhibit the rolling&#8208;up behavior.








Abstract
Rod&#8208;coil molecules comprising rigid rod segments and flexible hydrophilic chains have gained attention for generating highly defined nanostructures in solution. In this work, we report the fabrication of scrolled sheet and planar sheet structures from the self&#8208;assembly of laterally grafted rod&#8208;coil molecules. The mono&#8208;grafted rod&#8208;coil self&#8208;assembles into a scrolled sheet through the spontaneous rolling&#8208;up of the planar sheet perpendicular to the fiber long axis, interestingly, the scrolled structures undergo unrolling at higher temperature, exhibiting a thermal&#8208;responsive behavior. In contrast, the symmetrically grafted rod&#8208;coil molecules form planar sheet structures that do not exhibit the rolling&#8208;up behavior.

         <title>Optimization of Steroid Photochemistry and Its Application in the Synthesis of 5,6&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;Ophiopogonol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steroid photoreactivity was a major topic in the last century. This study revisits it by exploring the photochemistry of &#916;1&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids, offering an efficient method to modify the classic steroid 6/6/6/5 ring system. This approach enables the transformation of accessible steroids into rare ones, demonstrated by synthesizing 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ophiopogonol A in four steps from diosgenin.








Abstract
The photoreactivity of steroids represented a hot topic in the middle of the last century and in this project, we &#8220;rediscover&#8221; it through the exploration of the photochemical behavior of &#916;1&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids. In terms of number of products obtained, the photochemistry of &#916;1&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids is less complicated than that of &#916;4&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208; and &#916;1,4&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids, furnishing an efficient and tunable method to remodel the classic steroid 6/6/6/5 ring system. In this scenario, this approach can represent a simple strategy to interconvert a class of easily available steroids to another difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access from natural sources. As a proof of concept, the synthesis 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ophiopogonol A (11), a very close analog of natural ophiopogonol A (7), was accomplished in just four steps starting from easily available diosgenin (8).

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches with Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitches with a perfect tweezer&#8208;like bending motion and a large amplitude of movement are ideally suited as molecular actuators for applications in photoresponsive materials, biomolecules and photopharmacology. For this purpose, the core of the diazocine photoswitch was extended via cyclic imides. The compounds can be easily synthesized and late&#8208;stage functionalized.








Abstract
Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work, we present an approach to preparing diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates, MOFs, and COFs.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Dependent Energy&#8208;Gap Modulation of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems Based on Hypervalent Silicon(IV)&#8208;Fused Azomethine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel system to modulate the energy gaps of &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds by using geometrical isomers, square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries, based on five&#8208;coordinated hypervalent silicon&#8208;fused azomethine compounds. It is revealed that the energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that of the SPY one owing to the stronger contribution of a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are dynamically changeable with external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations.








Abstract
The colors of substances and emissions are determined by the width of the energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals. In general, significant structural transformation or chemical modification is essential to tune the energy gap. Herein, we reveal a hypervalent silicon compound that can form both square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries and demonstrate a novel technique to modulate the energy gap of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that in the SPY geometry owing to the stronger contribution of a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are changeable by external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations. Correspondingly, the emission bands in the orange (&#955;PL = 640&#160;nm) and yellow (&#955;PL = 579&#160;nm) regions were observed from the TBPY geometry at room temperature and the SPY geometry at &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, the geometry can be fixed to the TBPY geometry by introducing bulky substituents at silicon. These mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically clarified in detail. Our findings described here are expected to be a novel molecular design for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Gold Super&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanosystem for SERS&#8208;Guided Oxygen&#8208;Independent Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gold superlattice nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) enables SERS&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent photothermal/free radical synergistic therapy for tumor ablation. Integrating diagnosis and real&#8208;time monitoring, it overcomes the limitations of conventional therapies via localized hyperthermia, oxygen&#8208;independent cytotoxicity, and tunable surface plasmon resonance, offering a precise theranostic platform for cancer management.








Abstract
Cancer treatment remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and hypoxic microenvironment of tumors, which often compromises therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional gold super&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) was developed for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy. This nanosystem integrates diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities through a gold superlattice&#8208;nanoparticle (GSP) core self&#8208;assembled from 5.8&#160;nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), functionalized with 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT) as a Raman reporter. The GSPs are encapsulated with a polydopamine (PDA) shell for enhancing their structural stability, Raman signal amplification, and serving as a photothermal agent. The PDA coating layer is further loaded with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH), an oxygen&#8208;independent photosensitizer that releases cytotoxic free radicals, and cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide for tumor targeting. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the nanosystem generates hyperthermia and releases free radicals, achieving oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation. Real&#8208;time SERS imaging ensures precise tumor monitoring, addressing key challenges in cancer management. This novel approach combines the benefits of highly sensitive SERS imaging, targeted drug delivery, and oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy, providing a robust platform for synergistic cancer diagnosis and treatment with significant therapeutic potential.

2&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, available by diastereoselective cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;azirines, can be successfully involved in strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening processes, as illustrated by their reaction with benzyl chloroformate, trifluoroacetic anhydride or palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenolysis. These latter transformations allow access to diversely substituted 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)azetidines which constitute scaffolds of potential interest in medicinal chemistry.








Abstract
Substituted azetidines are privileged heterocyclic scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and have become synthetic targets of high interest in recent years. With the goal of developing a new access to azetidines incorporating the pharmaceutically relevant trifluoromethyl group, the reactivity of 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes was investigated in polar strain&#8208;release reactions. By using benzyl chloroformate or trifluoroacetic anhydride as reacting partners, diversely substituted 3&#8208;chloroazetidines, 3&#8208;substituted azetidines and azetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols bearing a trifluoromethyl group at C2 could be readily synthesized. In addition, palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenolysis reactions provided an entry to cis&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;trifluoromethyl azetidines.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Arylpyridylmethylamines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Coupling of Amines, Aldehydes, and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and modular photochemical method for the selective coupling of abundant and readily accessible amine, aldehyde, and pyridine feedstocks to access valuable arylpyridylmethylamines was achieved under mild conditions without the requirement of any transition&#8208;metal catalysts, photocatalysts, and acid additives. This multicomponent reaction features a broad substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group compatibility, and is amenable to one&#8208;pot large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalizations.








Abstract
The arylpyridylmethylamine motif is a privileged scaffold in drug discovery. However, rapidly creating these valuable molecules with structural diversity by directly leveraging readily available, yet simple chemical feedstocks remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a versatile and modular photochemical method for the straightforward construction of arylpyridylmethylamine skeleton utilizing widely accessible starting materials, including amines, aldehydes, and pyridines. This multicomponent coupling proceeds under very mild conditions without the need for any transition&#8208;metal catalysts, photocatalysts, and acid additives and displays a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The potential utility of this methodology in pharmaceutical development is demonstrated through late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, concise synthesis of bioactive compounds, and rapid construction of pyridyl analogue of drug molecules. Combined experimental and computational studies unveiled that this reaction proceeds through radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling between persistent pyridylphosphonium radicals and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals.

         <title>Efficiently Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting over Ni0.85Se&#8208;Ni Foam Electrode Modified with Nanoneedle&#8208;Like Ni3Fe Alloy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3Fe alloy was successfully deposited on the surface of the 3D porous Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrode by the electrochemical deposition method. The Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrodes exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance of overall water splitting in an alkaline solution under a three&#8208;electrode system.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 is one of the potential ways to develop clean and storable energy. In this study, the self&#8208;supported Ni0.85Se&#8208;Ni foam (Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF) hybrid electrode was modified with Ni3Fe (Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF) via a facile selenization and electrochemical deposition method. The Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF hybrid electrode exhibited excellent performance of electrocatalytic overall water splitting in an alkaline solution (1&#160;m KOH, pH&#160;=&#160;13.9), which is much more active than the individual Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF and Ni3Fe/NF. In particular, the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF hybrid electrode generated 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 cathodic current at an overpotential of 81&#160;mV, and 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 anodic current at an overpotential of 209&#160;mV in KOH solution (1&#160;m, pH&#160;=&#160;13.9), respectively. In addition, only 1.68&#160;V potential was required to generate 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 current in a two&#8208;electrode system for overall water splitting in an alkaline aqueous solution using the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF working as the anode and cathode, respectively. The TEM images and Raman spectra results indicated that the microstructure reconstruction happened on the surface of the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrode after the HER or OER test. Some Ni and Fe species were found to convert to the NixFe1&#8208;xOOH during water electrocatalysis.

         <title>Exploiting a New Strategy to Prepare Water&#8208;Soluble Heteroleptic Iridium(III) Complexes to Control Electrochemiluminescence Reaction Pathways in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble luminophores prepared by sulfonation of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes enable judicious tailoring of properties for unprecedented control of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways in aqueous solution. This approach removes a longstanding barrier to the translation of high&#8208;efficiency and multicolored ECL systems developed in organic solvents to the aqueous conditions desired for many analytical applications.








Abstract
The direct derivatization of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with sulfonate groups removes the limitations of prior strategies for the preparation of water&#8208;soluble analogues, in which complexes were prepared from a narrow range of ligands with suitably polar or charged functional groups. Phenylpyridine, phenylpyrazole, and phenylbenzothiazole ligands were selectively sulfonated opposite to their cyclometalated carbon within iridium(III) complexes containing bipyridine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ancillary ligands. Altering reaction conditions enabled additional sulfonation of the benzothiazole fragments. Informed by the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the parent complexes in organic solvents, we adopted this strategy to design six novel luminophores that proceeded through three different sets of coreactant electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways under aqueous conditions. The intensity of the indirect coreactant ECL of one of the iridium(III) luminophores was enhanced by over an order of magnitude by introducing a redox mediator, extending this promising analytical approach beyond the conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ electrochemiluminophore.

Photochemical alternative and sustainable approach for C&#9472;O bond formation at room temperature!! &#160;light&#8208;driven ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) strategy for site&#8208;selective C&#9472;O bond formation at room&#8208;temperature conditions. In situ formation of the organophosphine&#8208;ruthenium complex addressing challenges commonly encountered with traditional methods, making it a highly attractive and effective strategy. Mechanistic studies reveal the LMCT process, role of light, ligand and in situ formation of metal&#8208;complex intermediates.








Abstract
Photoinduced ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;benzoxylation through organophosphine ligand is unveiled. The in situ generation of the organophosphine&#8208;ruthenium complex facilitates ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) under visible light, promoting the site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208;benzoxylation at room temperature. The broad scope of aryl, aliphatic, and heterocyclic carboxylic acids are key attractions of this methodology. EPR and UV&#8208;Vis analysis support a LMCT process between a photoexcited organophosphine and Ru&#8208;complex under blue&#8208;light irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic investigation highlights the role of light, ligands, oxidants, the LMCT process, and the unique reactivity of the directing group.

We unveiled the thermally tunable nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport for a heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene derivative comprising antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene unit in the &#960;&#8208;backbone.








Abstract
Design of semiconducting materials with facile control of charge transport and the nature of charge carriers is essential for realizing niche applications with organic electronics. Described herein are the synthesis, crystal structure, and analysis of the electronic properties of a four&#8208;stage redox amphoteric S&#8208;heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene 6, including the study of its ambipolar charge carrier mobility (&#181;h and &#181;e) in organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. Despite being electron&#8208;rich, our investigation revealed reversible reduction potentials for 6 in the cyclic voltammetry, which is attributed to the recovery of locally aromatic thiophene and cyclopentadienyl anion units upon electron injection for the two antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene units in accordance with the Glidewell&#8208;Lloyd rule of aromaticity. In line with this, we observed an interesting thermal tunability of the nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport with reasonable semiconductor mobility in all regimes of transport. This behavior is correlated with the modification of the transport levels upon annealing of the semiconductor and possible increase in the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization with increasing temperature. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept tunability of the nature of charge transport indicates the efficacy of our molecular design.

         <title>Influence of Protonation and Iron(II) Complexation on Magnetic Interactions in Spin&#8208;Labeled Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates the influence of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on exchange coupling and magnetic properties in a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its free&#8208;axle biradicals. Mechanical bonding markedly modifies magnetic interactions, highlighting its potential for enabling the design of interlocked molecules with tunable spin states for advanced applications in molecular electronics and spintronics.








Abstract
This study reports the effects of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on the exchange coupling and magnetic properties of a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its corresponding free&#8208;axle biradicals. The rotaxane features nitronyl&#8208;nitroxide units as bulky stopper groups, a triazole&#8208;pyridine&#8208;triazole ligand as the axle component, and a bipyridine moiety within the macrocyclic ring. Our findings, obtained by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy in solution and magnetometry in solid state, demonstrate that rotaxanation and protonation induce profound changes in the magnetic interactions of the biradical both in its free form and as complexed with Fe(II). These results highlight the transformative impact of the mechanical bond on the electronic structure of interlocked radical systems.

         <title>Osteosarcoma Cell and Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Immunogenic Bi&#8208;Nuclear Gallium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current treatment options are unable to benefit the majority of osteosarcoma patients with metastasized tumors (70&#8211;80% 5&#8208;year fatality rate). Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs), a small sub&#8208;population of osteosarcoma cells with stem cell&#8208;like properties, are thought to play a role in the spread of osteosarcoma. In this manuscript, we report the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response toward both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.








Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, anti&#8208;osteosarcoma and anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cells (OSC) properties (cytotoxic and immunogenic) of a series of bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (1&#8211;4). According to monolayer cytotoxicity studies, 1&#8211;4 display micromolar potency toward bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs. The most effective complex in series 2 is up to 13&#8208;fold more potent toward OSCs than cisplatin and carboplatin (the only metallodrugs used in the clinic to treat osteosarcoma). Remarkably, the bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are significantly more potent toward 3D&#8208;cultured sarcospheres than OSCs cultured in monolayers indicating effective penetration of the sarcosphere multicellular architecture. The bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are up to 53&#8208;fold more potent toward sarcospheres than cisplatin and carboplatin. Mechanistic studies show that gallium(III) complex 2 kills osteosarcoma cells by caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis and paraptosis, leading to the release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns associated with immunogenic cell death. Osteosarcoma cells and OSCs treated with gallium(III) complex 2 are effectively phagocytosed by immune cells, highlighting its immunogenic potential. As far as it is known, gallium(III) complex 2 is the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response toward both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.

         <title>Multifunctional Alternating Copolymer Nanoflower Iodine Hosts for Long&#8208;Term Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel multifunctional alternating copolymer nanoflower iodine host as the cathode for Zn&#8208;I2 battery. It has combined the advantages of high&#8208;density polar groups, porous structure, and hydrophilic surface, and thus has exhibited efficient inhibition of the polyiodide shuttle effect. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Zn&#8208;I2 battery achieves a high performance in specific capacity and cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are considered to be potential energy storage systems due to their safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the shuttle effect of polyiodide leads to cathode active mass loss and anode Zn corrosion, which greatly reduces the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. Herein, we report an N&#8208;modified alternating copolymer nanoflower composite (NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA) as a new type of iodine host candidate to effectively inhibit the polyiodide shuttle effect in Zn&#8208;I2 battery. As a result, the NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA/I2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I2 battery demonstrates a high specific capacity of 185.42 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 99%. Moreover, it exhibits excellent cycling stability, achieving 10,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.0008% per cycle, ranking it among the best&#8208;performing polymeric host&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries in the literature. Density functional theory (DFT) and in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements illustrate the impressive suppression of polyiodide shuttle effect comes from the strong interaction between N&#8208;modification enhanced polyhydroxy sites in NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA and polyiodide. This work may shed new light on the design of advanced polymeric iodine hosts in Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Pd Nanoclusters in Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>

COFs rich in N and S sites were utilized to anchor Pd ions and grow in situ into Pd nanoclusters. This enabled the IEF enhancement to drive the directional migration of photogenerated electrons and promote carrier separation. Meanwhile, the introduced Pd NCs act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, realizing the efficiency enhancement of CO2 conversion to CO under visible light.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction offers a promising strategy to mitigate the greenhouse effect, yet it remains a challenging process due to the high energy barrier associated with the high stability of CO2. In this study, we synthesized Py&#8208;bTDC, a pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) enriched with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and anchored palladium nanoclusters (Pd NCs) onto its structure to enhance CO2 reduction efficiency. The confined Pd NCs amplify the built&#8208;in electric field (IEF), enabling efficient photogenerated carrier migration and suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination. Simultaneously, Pd NCs serve as catalytic active sites, optimizing CO2 adsorption and activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Pd reduces the energy barrier for forming the critical intermediate (*COOH), thereby accelerating CO production. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in a gas&#8208;solid system using water as a proton donor, the Pd3/Py&#8208;bTDC composite achieved a CO evolution rate of 17.75 &#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with 86.0% selectivity. This study advances the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by synergistically modulating IEF and the engineering active sites for efficient CO2 reduction.

         <title>Photoinduced Stable Circularly Polarized Luminescent Radicals From a Triphenylamine&#8208;Attached Planar Chiral Pillar[5]Arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a photoactivation approach to generate a stable circularly polarized luminescent free radical from triphenylamine&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar chiral pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) with sky&#8208;blue emission in the solid state. Theoretical calculations and experiments have demonstrated that the EtP5NN generated triphenylamine radical following exposure to UV irradiation, while the pillar[5]arene ring effectively stabilized the free radical species.








Abstract
Photoinduced organic radicals with unique luminescent properties are highly sought&#8208;after due to their important prospects in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, the current development of organic free radicals, including photoinduced ones, is significantly limited and faces challenges related to stability and poor luminescence behavior. Taking advantage of the photoelectric activity of triarylamine, we herein describe an unusual luminescent radical, which can be rapidly generated by UV irradiation of a solid&#8208;state triarylamine&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) in air, accompanied by luminescent color switching from bluish&#8208;violet to sky&#8208;blue. The persistent radicals within EtP5NN with a half&#8208;life of 12.7 h suggest that the pillar[5]arene skeleton straightforwardly improves the stability of radicals. The sterically bulky triarylamine groups inhibit the racemization of planar chiral pillar[5]arene and allow the optical resolution of this system. The enhancement of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is triggered by UV irradiation of the enantiomers (pS/pR&#8208;EtP5NN) in the solid state.

         <title>Parent, Unsubstituted Corrphycene: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of unsubstituted corrphycene and its precursor, 11,18&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcorrphycene. This porphine isomer exists in the form of a doubly degenerate trans tautomeric species in which two intramolecular H&#8208;bonds are not equivalent. Corrphycene turns out to be a soft chromophore, and, as such, seems to be an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a porphyrin isomer that, until now, has only been obtained in the form of multiply substituted derivatives. Structural, spectral, and electrochemical characteristics of unsubstituted corrphycene (Cp) are described along with the data for its precursor, 11,18&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcorrphycene. Similar to porphine, Cp turns out to be a soft chromophore, characterized by very similar energy splittings between the pairs of frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the splitting in the HOMO orbitals is larger than in the LUMO, opposite to the DFT predictions. Corrphycene exists in the form of a doubly degenerate trans tautomeric species. The two intramolecular H&#8208;bonds are not equivalent, which strongly suggests a stepwise mechanism of trans&#8208;trans conversion. Being a nearly perfect soft chromophore, Cp emerges as an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.

Abstract
A visible light&#8211;promoted cascade [2+2+1] bicyclization reaction of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes and activated alkyl bromides has been successfully established. This reaction exhibits mild conditions, metal&#8208;free characteristics, and excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy, along with environmental friendliness. It demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, underscoring its potential for practical applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process and a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by an iminyl radical.

         <title>Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Ni Catalysts Derived from Phyllosilicates for Synergistically Catalyzing CO2 and CH4 Dry Reforming</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of Cu&#8208;Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized using a stepwise ammonia evaporation&#8208;hydrothermal method Cu&#8208;Ni alloy in situ devried from bimetallic layered silicates facilitates the high dispersion and intimate distribution of copper and nickel atoms. The structure enhanced the oxidation resistance of nickel particles and inhibited their migration. In addition, the alteration of the reaction pathway inhibited carbon deposition and enhanced sintering resistance.








Abstract
Methane dry reforming reaction offers an attractive route to simultaneously convert two kinds of greenhouse gases into clean fuels and highly valuable chemicals. Nevertheless, the inactivation of nickel&#8208;based catalysts due to sintering and coking in dry reforming has severely limited its industrial application. In this study, we proposed a step&#8208;by&#8208;step strategy to prepare a series of bimetallic xCu&#8208;Ni/SiO2 catalysts derived from phyllosilicate precursors. The optimized catalyst shows exceptional performance, with no deactivation during the 50 hour stability test, and the CH4 and CO2 conversion were 88.8% and 94.0%, respectively. This was attributed to the synergistic catalysis of Cu&#8208;Ni alloy, which effectively inhibits coke formation. Additionally, the distribution of copper species between nickel species inhibited the mobility and enlargement of nickel particles and thus enhanced the resistance to sintering. The preparation strategy offers valuable insights for designing and preparing highly efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts under high&#8208;temperature conditions.

In addition, the alteration of the reaction pathway inhibited carbon deposition and enhanced sintering resistance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane dry reforming reaction offers an attractive route to simultaneously convert two kinds of greenhouse gases into clean fuels and highly valuable chemicals. Nevertheless, the inactivation of nickel-based catalysts due to sintering and coking in dry reforming has severely limited its industrial application. In this study, we proposed a step-by-step strategy to prepare a series of bimetallic xCu-Ni/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts derived from phyllosilicate precursors. The optimized catalyst shows exceptional performance, with no deactivation during the 50 hour stability test, and the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion were 88.8% and 94.0%, respectively. This was attributed to the synergistic catalysis of Cu-Ni alloy, which effectively inhibits coke formation. Additionally, the distribution of copper species between nickel species inhibited the mobility and enlargement of nickel particles and thus enhanced the resistance to sintering. The preparation strategy offers valuable insights for designing and preparing highly efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts under high-temperature conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Homologated Aminophosphorylation of Carbon&#8208;Carbon &#960;&#8208;, and &#963;&#8208;Bonds Through Radical Translocation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving homologous 1,n&#8208;functionalizations requires breaking the monopoly posed by the vicinal difunctionalizations. Radical translocation thereby becomes the weapon of choice, allowing access to traditionally difficult transformations. Herein, aminophosphorylation of alkenes, from 1,3&#8208; and all the way to 1,6&#8208;, is achieved. Additionally, strained &#963;&#8208;bonds are harnessed as well, leading to unique cyclobutylated aminophosphonates.








Abstract
Difunctionalization of olefins serves as the workhorse for rapid creation of molecular complexity from simple feedstocks. However, these reactions are mostly restricted to the 1,2&#8208;variant, with higher homologations being attempted to a much lesser extent. Radical translocation strategies serve as an escape from the traditional 1,2&#8208;strategies, providing a means for achieving distant functionalizations that are otherwise difficult to access. Herein, we disclose visible light&#8208;mediated strategies for the accessing of 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, 1,5&#8208;, and 1,6&#8208;aminophosphonates via combination of various radical shifting methods. In addition, the aminophosphorylation of &#963;&#8208;bonds was also achieved, leading to 1,3&#8208;aminophosphorylated cyclobutanes.

Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have garnered huge attention as a promising platform for solar to chemical energy conversion. In this work, two novel azadiene&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;JLU236 and COF&#8208;JLU237) were designed and successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions for the first time. And new materials have high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability, and broad absorption range, as well as excellent photoelectric properties.

The AD&#8208;HoC platform streamlines photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, eliminating catalyst, ligand, and base optimization. Machine learning predicts reactivity and selects additives using substrate electronic and geometric traits. Quantum mechanical calculations and cheminformatics enhance understanding, while an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool predicts outcomes from SMILES (Simplified Molecular&#8208;Input Line&#8208;Entry System) boosting synthetic precision and efficiency.








Abstract
Under visible light&#8208;driven redox conditions, employing transition&#8208;metal catalysis provides a powerful platform for constructing C(sp2)&#8211;(hetero)atom bonds. Although these reactions are highly significant, they require precise optimization of reaction parameters. K&#246;nig, Ghosh, and colleagues introduced an adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD&#8208;HoC) platform that furnishes robust, high&#8208;yield conditions for photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The AD&#8208;HoC system eliminates the need to optimize catalysts, ligands, and bases, instead, it achieves C(sp2)&#8211;(hetero)atom bond coupling by merely altering additives and substrate molecules. Leveraging the predictability of reaction conditions within the AD&#8208;HoC system, machine learning offers a method to evaluate the reactivity of substrate combinations and the categories of additives. Our research integrates high&#8208;throughput quantum mechanical calculations with cheminformatics approaches to explore the reactivity of substrate combinations and the selection of additives within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Further data&#8208;driven analysis reveals that the electronic characteristics of electrophiles and the geometric characteristics of nucleophiles are key factors regulating reactivity within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Herein, we present an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES (Simplified Molecular&#8208;Input Line&#8208;Entry System) representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.

         <title>Effects of Chirality and Counter Anions on the Structures and Solid&#8208;State Properties of Radical Cation Salts of Benzo[b]Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Double Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures and electronic properties of radical cation salts of racemic and enantiopure double hetero[5]helicene with SbCl6&#8722; and NTf2&#8722; counter anions were investigated. Enantiopure NTf2&#8722; salts exhibited low melting points and drastic changes in magnetic properties upon melting, while racemic NTf2&#8722; salt showed a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition near room temperature.








Abstract
In this study, we prepared stable radical cation salts of racemic and enantiopure double hetero[5]helicene (1), consisting of two benzo[b]phenoxazine (BPO) molecules, using two different counter anions (SbCl6&#8722; and NTf2&#8722;). The effects of chirality and counter anions on the packing structure and solid&#8208;state electronic properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that the SbCl6&#8722; anion was positioned above the midpoint of 1&#183;+ in both the racemic and enantiopure crystals of 1&#183;+&#183;SbCl6&#8722;. This alignment resulted from the matching between the curvature of 1&#183;+ and the spherical shape of the SbCl6&#8722; anion, preventing the formation of continuous &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions among 1&#183;+. In contrast, 1D &#960;&#8211;stacked columns of 1&#183;+ were present in both the racemic and enantiopure 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; crystals, as the NTf2&#8722; anions encased the &#960;&#8208;stacked columns of 1&#183;+. All radical cation salts exhibited distinct melting points, and the enantiopure salts of 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; had notably low melting points of 393&#8211;395 K, which was 142 K lower than that of rac&#8208;1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722;. ESR and SQUID measurements of the enantiopure 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; crystals revealed significant changes in their magnetic properties upon crystal melting. In contrast, rac&#8208;1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; displayed an unexpected crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by a thermal hysteresis loop in its magnetic susceptibility.

         <title>In Vitro Psilocybin Synthesis by Co&#8208;Immobilized Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The drug candidate and psychedelic mushroom product psilocybin was produced by multienzyme&#8208;charged beads in a biocatalytic cell&#8208;free approach. Using immobilized fungal indolethylamine biosynthetic and additional bacterial enzymes, these beads turned over 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan to psilocybin. This approach circumvents the drawbacks of in vivo processes while harnessing the selectivity of enzymatic catalysis

Abstract
Advanced clinical trials investigate the Psilocybe magic mushroom natural product psilocybin as a treatment against major depressive disorder. Currently, synthetic material is used to meet the demand for legitimate pharmaceutical purposes. Here, we report an in vitro approach to biocatalytically produce psilocybin on a solid&#8208;phase matrix charged with five covalently bound biosynthetic enzymes. These enzymes include three Psilocybe enzymes: IasA*, an engineered l&#8208;tryptophan decarboxylase/aromatic aldehyde synthase, the 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine kinase PsiK and the norbaeocystin methyltransferase PsiM, along with Escherichia coli nucleosidase MtnN and adenine deaminase Ade. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiment, this enzyme&#8208;charged resin allowed for quantitative turnover of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan into psilocybin. This facile process i) represents a sustainable approach with reusable enzymes, ii) circumvents the drawbacks of in vivo processes while harnessing the selectivity of enzymatic catalysis and iii) helps access an urgently needed drug candidate.

Redox&#8208;driven oxygenation at the backbone of the aldimine derived bridge via O2 activation in isomeric diruthenium set&#8208;up as a function of electronic nature of ancillary ligands has been evaluated.








Abstract
The article describes stepwise oxygenation of the aldimine functions at the backbone of N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)naphthyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;diimine (L) in noninterconvertible L&#8208;bridged isomeric diruthenium(II)&#8208;acac complexes [{RuII(acac)2}2(&#956;&#8208;L)] (cis&#8208;1a/trans&#8208;1b, acac&#160;=&#160;acetylacetonate, DFT calculated &#916;Ecis&#8208;trans&#160;=&#160;440 cm&#8722;1) via dioxygen activation. It leads to the formation of the corresponding carboxamido bridged [{RuIII(acac)2}2(&#956;&#8208;Ld2&#8722;)] (cis&#8208;1ad/trans&#8208;1bd; d denotes doubly&#8208;oxygenation) with the concomitant metal oxidation. However, L in doubly oxidized (RuIIIRuIII) congeners, i.e., [{RuIII(acac)2}2(&#956;&#8208;L)](ClO4)2 (cis&#8208;[1a](ClO4)2/trans&#8208;[1b](ClO4)2) as well as electron&#8208;poor metal fragments derived [{RuII(bpy)2}2(&#956;&#8208;L)]4+ [2](ClO4)4 (bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and [{RuII(PPh3)2(CO) (H)}2(&#956;&#8208;L)]2+ [3](ClO4)2 failed to undergo the aforestated oxygenation process on purging O2 even at elevated temperature due to the absence of necessary electron exchange between ruthenium and L (i.e., RuII&#8208;L&#8208;RuII&#8596;RuIII&#8208;L&#8226;&#8722;&#8208;RuII) to initiate the oxygen activation step. Besides structural and spectroscopic characterization of the complexes, oxygenation processes were further monitored through electrochemical, EPR and kinetic experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations, which highlighted mechanistic insights into the reaction sequence.

         <dc:description>
Dihydroazulene&#8208;spiropyran (DHA&#8208;SP) photochromic dyads were prepared and investigated by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. By comparing the overall properties, including dynamics of photoswitching, to those of monomeric units, the dyads satisfy the so&#8208;called &#8220;meta&#8208;rule&#8221;. The dyads can reach eight different states, some only by a specific sequence of stimuli, here represented by a finite&#8208;state&#8208;machine diagram&#8212;this path&#8208;dependent switching adds an additional degree of data storage.








Abstract
Multistate switches are interesting systems for a plethora of potential applications, such as for data storage involving many different states or for logic operations characterized by specific outputs. The main challenge is to achieve a precise control of accessibility to a specific state via a given sequence of multiple stimuli. Here, we have connected dihydroazulene (DHA) and spiropyran (SP) photoswitches in dyads to elucidate differences in optical and switching properties between ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged dyads. Dyads were prepared by Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions and photoisomerizations studied in detail by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. Moreover, the kinetics of thermal back&#8208;reactions of meta&#8208;stable states were studied. The results show path&#8208;dependent switchings of the dyads using light in combination with other stimuli (acid/base/heat), allowing access to eight distinct states. The accessibility to some specific states via only one sequence of external stimuli provides an additional degree of data storage&#8212;information is not only stored as the state itself but also as the unique sequence of stimuli required to reach this state. By changing the bridging unit between the photoswitches, various properties (outputs) were finely tuned such as absorption and fluorescence behaviors, lifetime of meta&#8208;stable state, and photoisomerization dynamics.

Weak Coordination, High Potentials: Making use of the weakly coordinated copper(I)&#8208;dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) as a precursor, homoleptic Cu(I)&#8208;arene complexes with weakly basic (fluorinated) arene ligands were synthesized. The higher the degree of fluorination of the arenes, the weaker are their interaction with Cu(I) and the higher are their Cu+/Cu redox potentials reaching +1.5&#160;V versus Fc+/Fc in pentafluorobenzene.








Abstract
The dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) acts as the precursor for the synthesis of homoleptic, weakly bound Cu(I)&#8208;arene complexes with benzene, fluorinated, and multicyclic arenes. Upon dissolution of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] in benzene or the fluorinated arenes xFB (x&#160;=&#160;number of fluorine atoms, x&#160;=&#160;1&#8722;4), the complexes [Cu(C6H6)2&#8722;3]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, [Cu(xFB)2&#8722;3]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (x&#160;=&#160;1&#8722;3), or the ion pair [(xFB)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (x&#160;=&#160;4) form. Both the benzene and fluorobenzene complexes are also available in larger scales by oxidation of elemental copper in the respective solvents using [NO]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; as an oxidant. A higher degree of fluorination of the arene ligand leads to a weaker coordination of the Cu(I) atom and thus to higher Cu+/Cu redox potentials in solution that reach an unprecedentedly high value of +1.5&#160;V (!) versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple in pentafluorobenzene. The versatile applicability of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] as a &#8220;naked&#8221; Cu(I) source is demonstrated by complexation reactions with the multicyclic arenes anthracene and hexaphenylbenzene that yielded multiply charged cations. All complexes presented in this work were characterized by their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structures.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 29, May 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two versatile photoredox catalysis platforms were developed to engage C(sp3)&#8211;H acids in hydroalkylations, cross&#8208;couplings, and oxidative cyclizations. Extensive synthetic and mechanistic investigations demonstrate a complementarity between the activation mechanisms of these two systems.








Abstract
We present a detailed study on a photoredox catalysis platform that directly engages 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl C(sp3)&#8211;H acids toward radical reactions. This platform enables redox&#8208;neutral hydroalkylation and cross&#8208;coupling, as well as oxidative transformations that demonstrably improve on the prior state of the art. Herein, we present interrogations of the underlying catalytic cycle and mechanism for this platform through kinetic, thermodynamic, and computational studies. The present investigations also demonstrate the key role of lithium trifluoroacetate under complementary Ce&#8208;containing and Ce&#8208;free photoredox conditions to enable ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) or multi&#8208;site proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (MS&#8208;PCET) activations, respectively.

         <title>Conception and Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;Coded Morpholinos</title>

Morpholino oligomer chemistry, which relies on the coupling of a chlorophosphoramidate group with the secondary amine of a morpholine ring, has been to date only explored for the synthesis of xeno nucleic acids. Here, we report that it can also be used for the design of digital polymers. Oligomers with different sizes and sequences were synthesized using a binary monomer alphabet.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;phase morpholino chemistry was explored as a new route to synthesize abiological sequence&#8208;defined oligomers. Two comonomers, 0 and 1 containing (i) a chlorophosphoramidate reactive function, (ii) a trityl&#8208;protected morpholine, and (iii) a coding substituent (H or CH3 for 0 and 1, respectively) on the morpholine ring were first synthesized and characterized. This binary alphabet was afterwards tested for the synthesis of digitally&#8208;encoded oligomers with different lengths and sequences. The oligomers were prepared on a modified polystyrene resin, cleaved, and characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. When using a repetitive cycle containing only morpholino coupling and trityl deprotection steps, the formed oligomers were not uniform. Thus, an additional capping step was added. In these conditions, uniform coded sequences were prepared in most cases. Furthermore, the oligomers were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. In the studied collision&#8208;induced dissociation conditions, the repeat units of the oligomers undergo two main&#8208;chain fragmentations and full sequence coverage was observed for all studied sequences. Therefore, the binary messages stored in the oligomers could be decoded and retrieved in all cases.

         <dc:description>
The bis&#8208;cyclopropenimine ligand was used to isolate tetracarbonyl iron&#8208;stabilized tetrylones (Ge0, Sn0, Pb0). The strong donating abilities of tetrylones were further proven by reaction with Fe(CO)5 and Fe2(CO)9 to access the bis&#8208;Fe(CO)4 complexes. The complexes were structurally characterized by NMR&#8208; and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography, and their bonding situations were investigated computationally using density functional theory.








Abstract
We report on the utilization of the ethylene&#8208;bridged bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] (bisCPI) ligand, LCPI, to give access to new main&#8208;group E(II) halide complexes (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; 1, 2, 3). Subsequent reduction with Collman's reagent (Na2Fe(CO)4&#160;&#8226;&#160;dioxane) enables the isolation of a series of zero&#8208;valent tetrylone&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes, (LCPI)E(Fe(CO)4 (E = Ge (4), Sn (5), Pb (6)). Compounds 4 &#8211; 6 were reacted further with iron pentacarbonyl to yield the bis&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes (LCPI)E[(Fe(CO)4]2 (E = Ge (7), Sn (8), Pb (9)). The electronic structure of these complexes was studied by 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and computationally by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Reversible photocyclization of imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene derivative apparently over non&#8208;triene form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C&#8208;N framework along with C=C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes. The symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical diarylethenes and satisfied the Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in diarylethenes, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;type Reaction toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.</dc:description>

         <title>Diameter Controllable Separation of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Simply Changing the Metal in Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties which are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present novel approach for size&#8208;tunable diameter separation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal&#8208;coordinating supramolecular polymers (M&#8208;PNB)&#160;consisting of phenanthroline&#8208;based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with&#160;M&#8208;PNB&#160;is confirmed by TEM analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with&#160;PNB&#160;show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 &#8211; 0.92 nm) and the larger (0.97 &#8211; 1.10 nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in&#160;M&#8208;PNB&#160;is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)&#8208;SWNTs. This method offers not only size&#8208;tunable diameter selectivity, but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency, and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands have been synthesized and characterized which show excellent catalytic activity towards &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), as quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures, combine the exceptional properties of graphene with tunable bandgaps. The incorporation of periodic non&#8208;hexagonal ring motifs into GNR frameworks offers an effective approach to significantly tailor their electronic and magnetic properties. However, synthesis of GNRs incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal rings remains challenging, due to the thermodynamic instability compared to their hexagonal counterparts. Advancements in on&#8208;surface synthesis and in&#8208;situ characterization techniques have emerged as powerful methods for the atomically precise fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;hexagonal ring&#8208;embedded GNRs via sophisticated design of precursors and optimized reaction pathways. This review is aimed to provide insights into strategies for constructing carbon polygons into nanostructures via surface&#8208;mediated chemical reactions, thereby enabling their multifunctional applications in electronics and magnetism.</dc:description>

Abstract
Three new dinuclear complexes [CuCl(o&#8208;van&#8208;en)Ln(H2O)3 Cl]Cl&#183;C2H6O (Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3); H2(o&#8208;van&#8208;en) is the Schiff base formed by 2/1 condensation of o&#8208;vanillin and ethylenediamine) were prepared in a single crystal form by the method of horizontal diffusion. The prepared complexes were characterized by chemical analyses and IR spectroscopy. The three complexes are isostructural and the Cu(II) is situated in the smaller cavities while the larger cavities accommodate larger Ln(III) atoms. The pentacoordination of the Cu(II) atoms is completed by a chlorido ligand in the apical position, while the octacoordination of the Ln(III) atoms is achieved by three additional aqua and one chlorido coligands. AC susceptibility studies have shown that complexes 2 and 3 exhibit field supported slow magnetic relaxation while complex 1 does not display AC activity.

The pentacoordination of the Cu(II) atoms is completed by a chlorido ligand in the apical position, while the octacoordination of the Ln(III) atoms is achieved by three additional aqua and one chlorido coligands. AC susceptibility studies have shown that complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibit field supported slow magnetic relaxation while complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; does not display AC activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation of azoarene to N&#8208;alkylated hydrazine is reported. The mild reaction conditions suppress N&#8211;N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Br&#248;nsted acid and H&#8208;bond donor catalysis.








Abstract
Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N, N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by boronic acid&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N&#8211;N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late&#8208;stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Br&#248;nsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Br&#248;nsted acid and H&#8208;bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN's Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Focused on DC&#8208;SIGN&#8211;glycan recognition, two diverse monosaccharide scaffolds, D&#8208;Man (D&#8208;Rha) and L&#8208;Gal (L&#8208;Fuc), maintain the exquisite stereochemistry encoded in the minimal binding epitope. Decoration of this framework could guide developments of glycomimetics basased DC&#8208;SIGN binders.








Abstract
Glycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror&#8208;image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin&#8211;glycan recognition, using the well&#8208;characterized human C&#8208;type lectin Dendritic cell&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) as a model. By combining experimental (STD&#8208;NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC&#8208;SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2&#8314;&#8208;coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L&#8208;fucose and D&#8208;mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC&#8208;SIGN also binds &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose, and myo&#8208;inositol. Among these, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;D&#8208;mannose, while &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose binds more strongly than D&#8208;rhamnose and myo&#8208;inositol, although with lower affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;L&#8208;fucose. STD&#8208;NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.

         <title>Efficient Singlet Oxygen Monitoring in Aqueous Media Comprising a Polymer&#8208;embedded Eu3+&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet dioxygen (1O2) sensitive Eu(III) complex embedded in polymer nanoparticles efficiently detects 1O2 in aqueous media by a remarkable increase in Eu3+ luminescence. These particles also adhere to bacteria surfaces, where the cells appear brightly stained in the presence of 1O2 enabling spectroscopic evaluation and easy detection under the microscope.








Abstract
Singlet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo&#8208;inactivation of antibiotic&#8208;resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of &#185;O&#8322; following its photo&#8208;catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to &#185;O&#8322; through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500&#8208;fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 &#181;s and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high&#8208;surface charge (&gt;+30&#160;mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary &#8220;proof of principle&#8221; staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time&#8208;gated measurements, that is, to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.

         <title>Quercetin&#8226;Zirconium Metal Complexes: Insights from Femto to Millisecond Photobehavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The switching off of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), followed by the switching on of ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes in quercetin (QRT)&#8226;Zr complexes, is crucial for generating Zr&#8208;bound QRT radicals that exhibit significantly shorter lifetimes compared to free QRT radicals. The results indicate a faster regeneration of QRT&#8226;Zr complexes through back electron transfer (BET), which could modulate their antioxidant activities.








Abstract
Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#8226;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, and water, the UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50&#8211;100&#160;nm) and high global binding constants (1 &#8211; 14&#160;&#215; 109 M&#8722;2). While the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal&#8208;bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Linkage Engineering of Triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Amines</title>

TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage, demonstrates significantly higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage, for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines with O2, highlighting the pivotal role of linkage engineering.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine&#8208;based COFs, yielding TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage and TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage. TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF. More importantly, the C&#9552;C linkage in TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C&#9552;N linkage in TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;&#8208;delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.

         <title>B/N&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbons as Metal&#8208;Free and Binder&#8208;Free Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binder&#8208;free B/N&#8208;codoped porous carbon, derived from a PFD polymer, generates high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state supercapacitors, demonstrating remarkable energy storage capabilities and lights up a 3&#160;V bulb.








Abstract
A facile, cost&#8208;effective, and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N&#8208;codoped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal&#8208;free and binder&#8208;free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;5, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10, and CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde&#8208;dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD&#8208;N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder&#8208;free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behavior. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22&#160;Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00&#160;W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3&#160;V LED bulb.

         <title>Intramolecular PCET of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids: Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Ketones via Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to favourable pharmacological properties, the introduction of the fluorine atom into small molecules has become increasingly more common over the past few decades. In particular, the trifluoromethyl ketone group is of great interest due to its role as a carboxylic acid bioisostere. Recently, these fragments have been accessed via acyl radical equivalents. Herein, we disclose an unconventional intramolecular proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer activation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids by photoredox catalysis to generate ketyl radicals toward accessing functionalizable lactones. These lactones serve as synthons for modular one&#8208;pot syntheses of trifluoromethyl ketones in a net dicarbofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Non&#8208;Activated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide &#8208; Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply &#160;Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non&#8208;activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com&#173;plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti&#8208;selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the "matched" enantiomer of the chiral "Berkessel salalen ligand" is employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Fluorophore with Enhanced Emission: Insights into Photophysical properties through Proton Transfer Mapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive study of a single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, characterized by a low molecular weight and a significant Stokes&#8217; shift, is reported. The fluorophore exhibits Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of non&#8208;emissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state, and rationalized the large Stokes&#8217; shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Vibration and Liquefaction of Flexible and Naturally Bent Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4'&#8208;azopyridine with long&#8208;chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light&#8208;responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerisation of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher&#8208;intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure imparts deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light&#8208;sensitive molecular components through covalent synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Palladium Catalysis Enabled Enantioselective Heck/Reductive Allylic Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The merger of palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8208;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting&#8208;edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters. The reaction initiates with a Heck&#8208;type addition to generate a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;PdII species, followed by a photoredox process or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to generate an allylic radical, which undergoes homocoupling to give the final product.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Key Ferredoxins for Nitrogen Fixation Have Different Specificities and Biophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferredoxins deliver electrons to drive many challenging biochemical transformations, including enzyme&#8208;catalysed nitrogen fixation. We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase mediated nitrogen fixation in Rhodobacter capsulatus. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN R. capsulatus&#8208;deletion strains under N2&#8208;fixing conditions, showed that plasmid&#8208;based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe&#8208;nitrogenase activity in both &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN strains, whilst plasmid&#8208;based fdxC expression could only complement the &#8710;fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]&#8208;cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, whilst providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2&#8208;fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effect on the Chiral Arrangement for Two Achiral Metal&#8208;Organic Colloids in the Vortex Field: Rheological Study and Retention Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vortex features a helical structure and exhibits macroscopic chirality. Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptical silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent&#8208;colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex&#8208;induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Emission in Cu(I)/Mn(II)&#160;Codoped Two&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Cd Chloride Perovskites for White Light Emitting Diodes and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for single&#8208;component white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange&#8208;red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+&#8208;induced extrinsic self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange&#8208;red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)&#8594;6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%&#8208;51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation&#8208;dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Ion Size and &#960;&#8208;Interaction in Stabilizing Calix[4]arene Crown Ether Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates MAXCalix's ability to coordinate alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, showing a preference for larger ions like Cs&#8314;. Structural analysis confirms that &#960;&#8208;interactions with benzene rings enhance stability, particularly for large cations that engage both rings. Competitive NMR experiments validate that stability increases with ionic radius, demonstrating MAXCalix's strong affinity for cesium.








Abstract
This study systematically investigates the influence of ion size on the structure and stability of complexes formed between the calix[4]arene crown ether 1,3&#8208;alt&#8208;25,27&#8208;bis(3,7&#8208; dimethyloctyl&#8208;1&#8208;oxy)calix[4]arenebenzocrown&#8208;6 (MAXCalix) and mono&#8208; and divalent ions from the alkali and alkaline earth metal series. NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand's versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. In addition, &#960;&#8208;interactions between the cation and the cation&#8208;facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from &#960;&#8208;interactions with both cation&#8208;facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These &#960;&#8208;interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.

&lt;p&gt;This work investigates MAXCalix's ability to coordinate alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, showing a preference for larger ions like Cs&#8314;. Structural analysis confirms that &#960;-interactions with benzene rings enhance stability, particularly for large cations that engage both rings. Competitive NMR experiments validate that stability increases with ionic radius, demonstrating MAXCalix's strong affinity for cesium.

         <title>Recent Cutting&#8208;Edge Technologies for the Delivery of Peptide Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of PNA cellular delivery methods, starting with traditional peptide&#8208;based systems and progressing to advanced approaches using nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene. It highlights how these innovative strategies have opened the way for more effective and efficient PNA delivery, ultimately enhancing the potential for broader therapeutic applications of PNAs.








Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have garnered significant attention due to their enhanced chemical, physical, and binding properties in comparison to natural nucleic acids. This prompted their application in antigene/antisense approach, assigning them a pivotal role in gene editing and, more recently, showing their potential as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; molecules being able &#8220;to speak&#8221; both nucleic acid and protein language. However, to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology&#8208;based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from peptide&#8208;based delivery systems, as well as cutting&#8208;edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq = semiquinone; cat = catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8208;/cat2&#8208; couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination is a unique ligation motif found in heme enzymes and small molecule sensors. Divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. We report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119 to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. We show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results suggest thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Triphosphaallyl Cation stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduction of the triphosphaallyl species 6[GaCl4] with GaI[Ga2Cl7] affords the imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted (L) bicyclo[2.1.1]&#8208;triphosphane, 10[Ga2Cl7], featuring an unprecedented Ga2Cl5&#8208;bridged P3 scaffold. Reactions of 10[Ga2Cl7] with nucleophiles (Cl&#8208; or NHC) result in rare, selective P&#8211;C bond cleavages, affording Ga2Cly&#8208;substituted triphosphiranes (LP3Ga2Cly, y = 5, 6) via an intramolecular ring closure mechanism. Protonation of 6[GaCl4] gives rise to a similar ring closure, but without P&#8211;C bond cleavage, to afford the L2P3H+ salt 8[OTfGaCl3]2. Additionally, the palladium complex 26[GaCl4], formed through the reaction of 10[Ga2Cl7] with [Pd(PPh3)4], presents a novel bicyclic P3Pd moiety (LP3Pd(PPh3)2[GaCl4]). Comprehensive DFT calculations have been conducted to elucidate the bonding situation in 26[GaCl4], uncovering significant metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation and a distinctive 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron hyperbonding phenomenon in the P3Pd framework. These findings offer valuable insights into chemistry of cyclic polyphosphorus compounds and, in particular, the reactivity, structural flexibility, and the coordination properties of cationic triphosphorus species.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Copper Complex with a Pyridazine&#8208;Bridged Octadentate Ligand: Monooxygenase Activity and Characterization of Copper&#8208;Oxygen Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the mono&#8208;oxygenation of aromatic and aliphatic substrates in Nature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a new dinuclear copper complex supported by an octadentate ligand with a pyridazine backbone. Low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#181;&#8208;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OOH) complex which in turn stoichiometrically converts anthrone (AT) to anthraquinone (AQ). Oxygenation at room temperature, by contrast, leads to a new species that mediates the conversion of AT to AQ in a catalytic fashion, but neither corresponds to a &#181;&#8208;peroxo nor a mono &#181;&#8208;oxo dicopper complex. For further analysis a &#181;&#8208;hydroxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OH) complex is synthesized by oxidation of the copper(I) complex with AgOTf. The electronic and geometric structures of the Cu2OOH and Cu2OH intermediates as well as the structure of the room&#8208;temperature oxygenation product are elucidated by UV/Vis, Raman, XAS and mass spectrometry, coupled to DFT.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Ammonia Capture and Exchange on Ion&#8208;Exchanged 4A Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia produced in fusion reactors can lead to issues with tritium accountability and corrosion, which increases challenges associated with utilizing it as a source for energy. However, utilizing platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites can allow for ammonia to be captured in situ and processed for isotope recovery.








Abstract
Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. However, in fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of reactive species. Therefore, identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND3&#8594;NH3). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work, we present the development of ion&#8208;exchanged A&#8208;type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. In this way, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A&#8208;type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND3 and NH3, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND3 from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.

         <title>Phosphor&#8208;Assisted TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescence (pTSF) OLEDs: Faster Excitons, Brighter Futures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impressive efficiency and lifetime under ultrahigh luminance remain a long&#8208;standing challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), as conventional fluorescent, phosphorescent, and thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) systems universally suffer from accelerated bimolecular annihilation at elevated exciton densities. Recently, phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that synergistically integrates exciton utilization enhancement and radiative decay acceleration through breaking the singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip cycles in TADF hosts via multiple sensitizations. The OLEDs based on pTSF achieve not only a nearly roll&#8208;off&#8208;free on external quantum efficiency but also a remarkable power efficiency, even when operating at ultrahigh luminance levels exceeding 100,000 cd m&#8208;2. In this review, we delve into the intricacies of pTSF technology, examining its material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes. Eventually, we critically assess the challenges in implementing pTSF for blue&#8208;emitting OLEDs and propose strategic research directions to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (&gt;90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant K567S_Y297P showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Potent Mannose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate Derivatives as Ligands for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R Using Fluorescence Polarization Assay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized novel mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their binding affinity for the CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2 receptor, which plays a key role in lysosomal targeting. Using a fluorescence polarization assay, we evaluated di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides and modified M6P analogs. Our results show that multivalent ligands significantly improve receptor binding, with phosphonate groups emerging as a promising stable alternative to native M6P








Abstract
The cation&#8208;independent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate/IGF2 receptor (CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R) plays a crucial role in transporting lysosomal enzymes and other ligands. In this study, we designed and synthesized novel stable mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their affinity for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R. To evaluate the binding potency, we employed a sensitive and cost&#8208;effective fluorescence polarization assay, enabling rapid quantification of receptor&#8211;ligand interactions in solution. The tested compounds included di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides along with various M6P&#8208;derived small molecules featuring phosphate isosteres or other functional modifications. Our findings indicate that ligands bearing multiple M6P moieties exhibit significantly higher receptor affinities than monomeric compounds and that phosphonate groups may serve as a more stable and potent alternative to native M6P. Computational modeling of ligand interactions with the CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R domains further elucidated the binding mechanisms, offering new directions for the development of more effective ligands. This study advances the design of therapeutic strategies that leverage CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R for targeted biomolecule delivery to lysosomes, thereby opening new possibilities for biomedical applications.

Specifically, we identified two VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9) based on a [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline scaffold that effectively and selectively degrade BRD9 and exhibit antiproliferative effects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, offering potential strategies for AML treatment and insights into BRD9's role in tumors.








Abstract
PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain&#8208;containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family&#8208;related targets, for example, BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non&#8208;BET proteins were reported so far. Among them, BRD9 was recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.

         <title>Oxidative Folding of a Two&#8208;Chain Protein Having Three Interchain Disulfide Bonds. Synthesis of Bromelain Inhibitor VI Through Native Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromelain inhibitor VI, a two&#8208;chain protein stabilized by three interchain SS bonds and two intrachain SS bonds, was synthesized in an incredibly high isolated yield (53%) just by mixing the two native chains in a buffer solution. This success made a record of oxidative protein folding for the most complicated and difficult one.








Abstract
The recently renovated two&#8208;chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different&#8208;type two&#8208;chain protein, that is, bromelain inhibitor VI (BI&#8208;VI), which has abundant &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)&#8208; and light (L)&#8208;chains of BI&#8208;VI were mixed at 4&#160;&#176;C in a pH of 10.0 buffer solution containing 2&#160;mM GSH and 0.4&#160;mM GSSG, native BI&#8208;VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53%) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI&#8208;VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non&#8208;activity. The rate&#8208;limiting step of the two&#8208;chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three&#8208;SS intermediates of the H&#8208;chain (3SSH) and one&#8208;SS intermediates of the L&#8208;chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multichain proteins with more complicated SS&#8208;bond topologies.

         <title>Anion Exchange Polyelectrolytes with High Branching Ratio and Adjustable Free Volume for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes with wide&#8208;ranged branching ratio (BR) and fractional free volume (FFV) were synthesized to meet the discrepant requirements for anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and ionomers (AEIs). By controlling BR, the resulting stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structures not only address the conductivity&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for AEMs but also meet the opposite gas permeation demands of AEMs and AEIs.








Abstract
Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide&#8208;ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid&#8208;catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structure is generated, which not only addresses the conductivity&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off of AEM but also possesses high OH&#8722; conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98&#160;V (pure water) and 1.62&#160;V (1&#160;M KOH) at 1 A cm&#8722;2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high&#8208;performance AEMWE.

         <title>Pulsed Strategy Steers the Structural Evolution of Cu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pulsed electrolysis enables the controlled reconstruction of Cu&#8208;DMTZ MOF into Cu2O/CuO active sites, which achieves an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 82.9% for methane production from CO2 electroreduction, markedly outperforming that in potentiostatic electrolysis mode.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane (CH4), offers a promising pathway to address the dual challenges of climate change and energy shortage. Although copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) have proven to be promising CO2RR catalysts for hydrocarbon production, their uncontrollable structural reconstruction under operating conditions leads to elusive active sites. Herein, we demonstrate that a pulsed potential electrolysis strategy with well&#8208;designed pulse parameters can steer the dynamic reconstruction of Cu&#8208;MOFs to customize the active sites to enable the CH4 formation pathway. Mechanistic studies using electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods indicated that constant&#8208;potential electrolysis caused the rapid reduction of Cu&#8208;MOF to metallic Cu nanoparticles, whereas pulsed electrolysis enabled the controlled generation of active Cu2O/CuO nanoclusters. Benefiting from this, the pulsed system delivers an exceptional Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.9% in CH4 production from the CO2RR. This selectivity markedly surpasses that of the constant&#8208;potential counterpart, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In addition, this approach facilitates stable CH4 production for over 12&#160;hours while maintaining an FE above 60%.

The structural similarity between complex 1 and the repeating unit of complex 2 is remarkable. However, their magnetic properties differ significantly, with complex 1 displaying dominant ferromagnetic interactions, and complex 2 showing antiferromagnetic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Disorazole Z1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We wish to report the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1 a biologically extremely potent natural product (picomolar cytotoxicity) with complex molecular architecture featuring a 26&#8208;membered macrodiolide with lateral chains including a quaternary chiral carbon center. The complex acyclic lateral chains containing a stereochemical triad with the quaternary center surrounded by two hindered secondary alcohols were synthesized in a straightforward way by the use of two consecutive and highly diastereoselective aldol reactions with a lactone intermediate and further transformations to yield the desired (Z)&#8208;vinyl iodide. Successful esterification with a functionalized diene&#8208;stannane yielded the fully elaborated carbon skeleton. Making use of the C2&#8208;symmetry of the natural product a double Stille coupling gave the protected natural product. Final deprotection provided (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1 which was fully identical with a natural sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) decorated with a high density of photochemically switchable ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2 nm) were surface&#8208;coated with photoswitchable 3&#8208;azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n&#8208;dodecanethiol&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E&#8208; and the metastable Z&#8208;isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, e.g. to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition upon irradiation</dc:description>

         <title>A Ruthenium(II)&#8208;DNA Nanophotosensitizer for cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;Mediated Photodynamic Immunotherapy Against Hypoxic Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient strategy by synergistic delivering DNA and DNA photocleavage agents to tumor cells was developed for effective photodynamic immunotherapy under hypoxia.








Abstract
Plasmid DNAs intercalated with Ru(II) complexes were encapsulated in liposomes to create nano&#8208;photosensitizers. Upon light exposure, the ruthenium complex photo&#8208;cleavages DNA. The DNA fragments specifically stimulate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and induce immunogenic death. This study presents a convenient strategy for photodynamic immunotherapy against cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells under hypoxia.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids are non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state functional materials that generate singlet oxygen (1O2) at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. Chromophores can be incorporated into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that produce 1O2 and membrane impregnated systems can be fabricated to generate 1O2 that migrates across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential for water decontamination.








Abstract
Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitizer into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile single&#8208;component condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitizers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid&#8208;water interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyze the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid photosensitizers. The alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate 1O2 within an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling Reveals IDH2 as a Mitochondrial Target of Cannabinol in Receptor&#8208;Independent Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical probe CBN&#8208;P based on the neuroprotective cannabinoid cannabinol (CBN) was developed and synthesized. CNB&#8208;P was found to have a similar mechanism of action as the parent compound and was used in click&#8208;CLEM microscopy studies and affinity&#8208;based protein profiling to identify the mitochondrial protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as one target of CBN.








Abstract
Phytocannabinoids are attracting growing attention because of their potential for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, the &#8220;minor&#8221; cannabinoid, cannabinol (CBN), has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent, acting independently of classical cannabinoid receptors through as&#8208;yet unidentified mitochondrial targets. To uncover the molecular basis of its neuroprotective effects, we designed and synthesized a chemical probe based on CBN, incorporating a minimalist diazirine linker. Functional assays confirmed that the probe retains CBN's mitochondrial activity and exhibits strong mitochondrial enrichment, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and click&#8208;correlative light and electron microscopy (click&#8208;CLEM). By affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP), we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as a key mitochondrial target of CBN. This finding was further substantiated by siRNA knockdown studies, which revealed that the absence of IDH2 partially phenocopies CBN's effects, validating its role as a critical mediator of CBN's neuroprotective activity.

Alkylation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) induces crystalline hydrophobic domains, critical for CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. Structural evolution during acid/base treatment and ion exchange is revealed by PXRD, SAXS, and inelastic neutron scattering. Findings highlight reversible domain disruption and nanostructure formation, enabling recyclable polymer performance in water purification and CO&#8322; capture.








Abstract
Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a widely used polymer in catalysis, gas separation, water treatment, drug delivery, textiles, and paper production. Carbon dioxide can act as a molecular stimulus for amine&#8208;rich polymers such as PEIs, a property that has been exploited in CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. This process entails amine&#8208;mediated CO&#8322; capture and the in situ formation of bicarbonate ions, which subsequently undergo ion exchange with chloride ions present in both model and real seawater. In this study, we prepared a series of alkylated PEIs with different chainlengths (C4&#8208;C18) and degrees of alkylation (10&#8208;40% alkylation) via simple alkylation as previously reported. The obtained hydrophobic PEI, specifically PEI&#8208;C16, was further investigated in terms of its crystalline structure using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, and inelastic neutron scattering. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the subtle structural changes of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine)s were induced by acid&#8208;mediated protonation and ion exchange, while the polymer maintained its integrity across multiple desalination cycles. These findings advocate for the employment of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine) in CO&#8322;&#8208;responsive processes and carbon capture applications.

         <title>Stereodynamism in Chiral Polyaromatic Phosphepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoid scaffolds can be used to afford diastereoisomers of polyaromatics fused with a chiral seven&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring. In particular, a complex interplay between the inversion at the P centre and helicenoid epimerization, as well as a competition with a rearomatization reaction, takes place.








Abstract
In the present experimental&#8208;computational study, we demonstrate that the stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoids&#160;can be used to afford diastereoisomers of chirally perturbed polyaromatics fused with a phosphepine ring (seven&#8208;membered P&#8208;cycle). The phosphahelicenoids have been synthesized through a stereospecific approach from commercially available BINAPs. In particular, using the combination of NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and chiral HPLC experimental techniques with DFT and higher level ab initio calculations, we highlight a complex interplay between the inversion at the phosphorus stereocenter and the epimerization of the helicenoid framework, as well as a competition with a rearomatization reaction through P&#8208;extrusion. The impact of the conformational modifications on the structure have been studied through X&#8208;ray diffraction. The spectroscopic properties, in particular, of chiroptical nature, including circularly polarized luminescence, are also discussed in detail and compared to DFT and ADC(2) models.

         <title>Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Functionalization of Phenols via &#960;&#8208;Coordination Activation: Mechanochemical Access to N&#8208;Aryl Amides and &#945;&#8208;Aryl Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mkrtchyan and Iaroshenko et al. report a convenient approach for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides and &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids/esters/ketones via Ru&#8208;catalyzed expected and unexpected dehydrative cross&#8208;coupling of unprotected phenols with primary amides or alkyl carboxylic acids/esters/ketones. The present protocol involves Ru&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative functionalization of phenols via &#960;&#8208;coordination activation.








Abstract
Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones, the same reaction led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls, and phenolic substrates to deliver 28 expected N&#8208;aryl amides and 14 unexpected &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross&#8208;coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Efficient and Rapid Arylation of NH&#8322;&#8208;Unprotected Bromobisindole Ethanamines via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling: Generating New Leads Against Leishmania</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of novel bisindole derivatives was synthesized through an optimized rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines and boronic acids with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against L. infantum promastigotes. In particular, bisindole 3af demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity with a higher selectivity index compared to the reference drug miltefosine.








Abstract
Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which presents significant global health challenges due to the lack of effective vaccines and the limitations of existing chemotherapeutics in view of their toxicity, resistance, and high costs. In this study, we realized a library of novel bisindole derivatives as potential antileishmanial agents through a rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindole ethanamines and boronic acids. Optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the efficient and selective arylation of these substrates, with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Among the tested bisindole derivatives, 3af (bearing a 4&#8208;vinylphenyl moiety) demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity (IC50 = 1.1 &#181;M) with a higher selectivity index (21.8) compared to the reference drug miltefosine (9.8). A significant activity was also retained against intracellular amastigotes. This study establishes a robust methodology for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bisindoles, also highlighting these derivatives' potential as promising leads for antileishmanial drug development.

         <title>Salt or Cocrystal Puzzle Solved by Mechanochemistry: The Role of Solvent in the Pamoic Acid Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pamoic acid:quinoline cocrystal and pamoate:quinolinium salts can be synthetized by mechanochemistry tuning the reaction conditions. Computational analysis of the crystal packing reveals the main factors driving the formation of either forms. This approach and subsequent rationalization pave the way to the synthesis of pharmaceutically active multicomponent systems with tunable properties.








Abstract
Many drugs are nowadays marketed as salts. Cocrystallization is also emerging as a convenient tool to modify in vivo activity of pharmacologically active compounds. Given the marked difference in physicochemical properties between salts and cocrystals, the possibility of obtaining crystalline systems composed of the same building blocks in their neutral or charged form is desirable. Pamoic acid (PAM) is widely used in pharmaceutical formulation as pamoate salt, and we here propose a unique synthetic strategy to obtain a cocrystal of PAM rather than a salt by tuning mechanochemical conditions. Our findings have been corroborated by means of computational analyses, relating to the noncovalent interactions in the crystal structure with the formation of the different crystalline forms. A detailed analysis of the structure containing PAM in its neutral, anionic or dianionic form present in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) helped generalizing our results.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Motion of Tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone within Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals Through Variation of the Donor: An Entropic and Enthalpic Point of View.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in&#8208;plane motion of tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state NMR, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short p&#8208;stacking interactions and varied non&#8208;covalent interactions modulating the in&#8208;plane motion of TFBQ. 19F T&#8321; relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (&#916;H&#8225;) and entropies (&#916;S&#8225;), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal 4 is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal 3a depicts the highest in&#8208;plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2 MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (5), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals 2 and 3a, displayed no significant in&#8208;plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in&#8208;plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polypyrrole as a photothermal reactor to conduct solvent&#8208;free pericyclic reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent&#8208;free organic reactions have proved to be sustainable and efficient strategy in organic synthesis. Current solvent&#8208;free approaches include mechanochemical, microwave&#8208;assisted, and ultrasound&#8208;irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent&#8208;free chemistry, offering the advantage of utilizing eco&#8208;friendly solar energy. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability, enabling it to server as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent&#8208;free thermal&#8208;induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrrole materials have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded PPy&#8208;BS, which achieved a highest photothermal performance (241&#176;C under 100 W halogen&#8208;lamp irradiation). On this basis, PPy&#8208;BS was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels&#8208;Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent&#8208;free conditions. All trials work well, affording good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability (over eight cycles without loss of the yields of the conducted model reactions), high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000 mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up&#8208;scalable, and solvent&#8208;free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso&#8208;form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed the preference to the P&#8208;form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provided future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Inorganic&#8208;Organic Rotaxanes and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extension of previous studies of heterometallic rings (HMRs) is described, including new synthetic chemistry and physics. These HMRs feature a ring of, typically, eight&#8208;metal centres with a central charge balancing cation. New HMRs and related molecules are described, varying the number of metals present. The eight&#8208;metal HMRs have been used as components of larger supramolecular assembly, most often by making the HMRs into [2]rotaxanes or pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes, where the thread of the rotaxane is terminated by a binding group such as pyridine. This allows the formation of [n]rotaxanes, where n = 3, 4, 5,7, 13 or 1014. Mass spectrometry and NMR studies of the HMRs have given greater understanding of the host&#8208;guest chemistry of these metal analogues of crown ethers. Physical studies have included 4D&#8208;inelastic neutron scattering and continuous wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure magnetic interactions between spin components of the supramolecular assemblies. The use of the HMRs as resists for high resolution lithography is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped with Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Materials in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The luminescence properties of stable halide double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI &#8211; 40% Ag, 60% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ in the region 250&#8208;1600 nm were investigated for the first time and reveal significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman Spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3+ ions emit blue light at 450 nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3+ ions. Notably, the Er3+ emit radiation at 1540 nm, a wavelength particularly advantageous for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525 nm, 552 nm, 665 nm and 805 nm are observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3+ ions. These compelling results have been supported by calculations based on Modified Crystal Field Theory, elucidating the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3+ and Er3+ on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. Leveraging the synthesized materials, we successfully have developed a LED prototype that utilizes a UV chip &#160;combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Reducibility&#8208;tunable Carbon Dots for Efficient Radicals Scavenging and Material&#8208;controlled Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient, nontoxic and low&#8208;cost nano&#8208;antioxidants has attracted extensive attentions in food preservation, but still remains greet challenges in materials design and mechanism exploration. Herein, a novel reductive carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) was successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that&#160;r&#8208;CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r&#8208;CDs exhibits remarkable preservation effect on apple and strawberry, and significantly extends their shelf&#8208;life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon&#8208;core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process.&#160;More interestingly, the reducibility of r&#8208;CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N&#8208;doped CDs (N&#8208;CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material&#8208;controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development&#160;of non&#8208;toxic, efficient carbon nano&#8208;antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material&#8208;controlled synthesis.</dc:description>

Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon-core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process.&#160;More interestingly, the reducibility of r-CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N-doped CDs (N-CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material-controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development&#160;of non-toxic, efficient carbon nano-antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material-controlled synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Constructing non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts with good hydrogen evolution activity is crucial for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. The synergistic optimization of the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps presents a challenge for the HER.&#160;Here,&#160;we &#160;have synthesized&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with oxygen vacancies (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x) using a simple but&#160;effective hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination annealing.&#160;Interestingly, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x material exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from conventional tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The introduction of oxygen vacancies and phosphorus doping creates an optimal structure that significantly improves the electronic properties and the catalytic sites. The oxygen vacancies enhance the material&#8217;s ability to adsorb and activate water molecules, while phosphorus doping further modifies the electronic structure, facilitating more efficient hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the catalyst demonstrates a favorable urchin&#8208;like morphology&#160;with excellent supportability. Remarkably, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x&#160;electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent HER performance and excellent durability.&#160;We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x exhibits&#160;a small overpotential (155.42 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2), a low Tafel slope (74.97 mV dec&#8208;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours.

         <title>Computational Exploration of Stereoelectronic Relationships in Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed computational investigation of stereoelectronic effects in enantioselective manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions uncovered two general routes to improved selectivity; namely extension of &#960;&#8208;system and increased steric bulk (quantified through occupied volume in quadrants). Electronic effects were evaluated through Hammett correlations, revealing opposing electronic demands on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key catalytic step of H2 activation.








Abstract
Stereoelectronic effects governing Mn&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have been deconvoluted through the analysis of a series of in silico catalyst modifications using DFT (PBE0&#8208;D3PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;TZVP//RI&#8208;BP86PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;SVP level of theory). Computations were performed on the Mn&#8208;catalyzed reduction of indanone based on a catalyst from the Clarke group, consisting of a tridentate ligand with pyridine, amine, and phosphine donors and a ferrocenyl linker in the backbone. Enantioselectivity enhancements were found through two pathways; first, with the stabilization of aromatic substrates by means of an extended &#960;&#8208;system, enhancing &#960;&#8208;stacking noncovalent interactions; second, by the introduction of steric bulk around the active site to destabilize one of the diastereomeric hydride transfer transition states. Electronic effects were differentiated from sterics by modification of the phenyl groups at the phosphine, trans&#8208; to the metal&#8208;hydride bond. While electron&#8208;withdrawing groups increased the thermodynamic driving force, the highest activity is predicted with electron&#8208;donating groups due to the improved basicity of the nitrogen lone pair, required for the initiation of hydrogen activation. Based on these observations, promising routes for synthetic catalyst design may involve donating groups which improve activity, coupled with enantiodiscrimination via steric bulk as a more general strategy than being limited to &#960;&#8208;containing substrates.

         <title>Role of Symmetry to Dictate Pathway&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;assembly in Photoresponsive Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the role of molecular symmetry with respect to azobenzene and the effect of local microenvironment in governing the self&#8208;assembly and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of peptide amphiphiles, revealing distinct aggregation pathways.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides offer interesting structural space in the realm of emergent pathway&#8208;driven supramolecular polymerization toward designing functional nanomaterials with precise structure&#8208;function characteristics. However, the role of molecular symmetry in such peptides to govern the self&#8208;assembly pathway dynamics remains less explored. We design amyloid&#8208;inspired, azobenzene&#8208;functionalized symmetric (P1) and asymmetric (P2) peptide amphiphiles in the E form of the azobenzene motif to systematically investigate the interplay of molecular symmetry, solvent composition, and temperature to guide supramolecular organization. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal distinct aggregation pathways, with E&#8208;P1 exhibiting rapid nucleation&#8208;elongation toward robust and stable nanofibers, while E&#8208;P2 assembles into a kinetic state (E&#8208;P2(KS)) that subsequently transforms into thermodynamically favored nanoribbons, E&#8208;P2(TS), via a &#8220;good and bad solvent&#8221; modulation strategy. Further, E&#8208;P1 remains structurally resilient due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, E&#8208;P2 demonstrates reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization in both kinetic and thermodynamic states, facilitating supramolecular disassembly while retaining the self&#8208;organization memory. Notably, the activation energy barriers for Z&#8594;E isomerization in P2 differ between its kinetic and thermodynamic states, underscoring the role of pathway complexity and molecular symmetry in peptide assembly. These insights advance the understanding of symmetry&#8208;regulated supramolecular assembly to modulate the emergent functional properties for potential applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials.

         <title>Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy Combined with Autophagy Inhibition to Enhance Synergistic Immunotherapy for Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately target tumor cells, and the ER&#8208;targeting photosensitizer CET can be used as an ICD inducer for amplifying the ICD effect. Meanwhile, the ER PDT was further strengthened by autophagy inhibition, which can achieve more effective autophagy&#8208;regulated photodynamic synergistic immunotherapy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.








Abstract
Activating immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy. However, photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;mediated ICD effect is severely limited due to the extremely short half&#8208;life and limited diffusion radius of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hindering effective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction. In addition, targeted therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains hugely challenging due to the lack of expression of multiple receptors. Herein, we constructed a hierarchical targeting and controllable intelligent nanodelivery material Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ based on poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with remarkable solubility and stability, loaded with a novel photosensitized ICD inducer, CET, and autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Excitingly, Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately recognize TNBC tumor cells under the mediation of SRC protein. Moreover, CET could achieve observable enrichment in the ER and amplify the ICD effect by in situ ER PDT, which is further strengthened by the autophagy inhibition caused by CQ. All results show that Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs exhibited excellent targeting ability to tumor cells and ER and effectively enhanced synergistic immunotherapy of in situ ER PDT combined with autophagy inhibition, which significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Overall, our study provides a novel strategy and meaningful guideline for targeted&#8208;PDT&#8208;synergistic immunotherapy of TNBC.

Chiral COSAN Nanocatalysts: Enantiopure silica COSAN&#8208;Hybrid nanohelices have been prepared by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of achiral COSAN anions and silica hybrid nanohelices. Their optical activity was confirmed by CD and ROA measurements. These COSAN&#8208;Hybrids are efficient and recoverable catalysts in the photooxidative kinetic resolution of aromatic secondary alcohols, achieving up to 85% ee.








Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;) named COSAN is a sandwich&#8208;type metallacarborane that has been widely explored in a variety of fields, due to its interesting physical and chemical properties. While COSAN and its derivatives have recently been investigated in catalysis, their chiral counterparts have, to our knowledge, never been investigated in asymmetric catalysis. This may be due to the difficulty associated with preparing and isolating enantiopure COSAN derivatives. Inspired by our previous work on the chiral induction of nanoscale silica helices on achiral objects, we prepared and characterized enantiopure COSAN&#8208;based left&#8208;and right&#8208;handed hybrid silica nanohelices (NANOCOSANs). In these structures, achiral COSAN anions are encapsulated within left&#8208;and right&#8208;handed organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid nanohelices, which serve as a chiral platform for COSAN in enantioselective transformations. The morphology and structural composition of these NANOCOSAN hybrids as well as the presence of COSAN species were confirmed using UV/Vis, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and solid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Their optical activity was demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Raman optical activity (ROA), highlighting the induction of chirality from chiral hybrid nanohelices to the achiral COSAN anions. To the best of our knowledge, these NANOCOSAN hybrids represent the first examples of COSAN&#8208;based chiral systems displaying chiroptical effects. In addition, they show excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the photooxidation of secondary aromatic alcohols in water. Specifically, the left&#8208;handed NANOCOSAN that selectively oxidizes the (S)&#8208;alcohol, while the right&#8208;handed oxidizes the (R)&#8208;alcohol, achieving up to 85% enantiomeric excess (ee). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle catalytic experiment demonstrates the transfer of chiroptical properties from the hybrid nanohelices to the catalytically active and originally achiral COSAN anion, enabling supramolecular asymmetric catalysis. Remarkably, the catalyst was recovered and reused at least three times without any loss of catalytic activity or enantioselectivity. This study reports the first example of enantiopure COSAN&#8208;containing nanohelices, which can promote photooxidation of organic substrates in water with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Integrating Catalysis and Analysis: Accelerated Asymmetric Reaction Development With a Multitasking Reactivity Umpolung/Chiroptical Reporter Auxiliary</title>

         <dc:description>
A readily available isatin molecule serves as amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter to enable chromatography&#8208;free high&#8208;throughput optimization of an organocatalytic asymmetric Michael addition solely based on the analysis of UV and circular dichroism inductions that are obtained directly from the reaction mixtures and without time&#8208;consuming sample preparation or work&#8208;up.








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction development of an organocatalytic Michael addition is achieved by using a readily available isatin molecule as an amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as a chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter. The use of UV and circular dichroism inductions allows on&#8208;the&#8208;fly, chromatography&#8208;free parallel screening of a hundred reaction conditions to identify a catalytic procedure that converts a primary amine to either enantiomer of an a&#8208;branched chiral product in excellent yields and ee&#8217;s. The isatin is recyclable and can be quantitatively recovered if desired. This case study shows how chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening with a multitasking reagent can increase method development speed and reduce cost and waste compared to traditional reaction optimization workflows by streamlining the analysis of small&#8208;scale reaction setups and eliminating time&#8208;consuming work&#8208;up protocols.

The catalytic asymmetric Michael additions of 1&#8208;pyrroline esters to &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alkenyl imides and azodicarboxylates in the presence of AgOAc or CuOAc catalyst have been established.








Abstract
The asymmetric Michael addition reactions of 1&#8208;pyrroline esters with &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alkenyl imides and dialkyl azodicarboxylates catalyzed by the AgOAc/Ph&#8208;phosferrox or CuOAc/(R)&#8208;BINAP complex have been developed. A series of chiral 1,5,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrroline ester derivatives have been obtained in 53%&#8211;90% yields with 80%&#8211;99% ee&#8217;s and all&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic application of the chiral trifluoromethylated 1&#8208;pyrroline adducts were exhibited: the pyrrolizidin&#8208;3&#8208;one analogue was first synthesized with 94% ee and&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr through two steps of hydrolysis and reductive cyclization; the pyrrolidine and lactam derivatives were also successfully provided under the reducing conditions of NaBH3CN and Pd/C&#9472;H2, respectively.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Production Type Prussian Blue Analogues: A Family of Promising Hosts for High&#8208;Performance Multivalent&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Wu and coworkers review the recent progress of entropy&#8208;enhanced Prussian blue analogues as one typical class of high&#8208;performance electrode for non&#8208;monovalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. The influence of introducing the entropy increase strategy in terms of structure and electrochemistry is introduced emphatically.








Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;performance, safe, and cost&#8208;effective multivalent&#8208;ion batteries is pivotal for sustainable energy storage. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open framework and tunable redox&#8208;active sites, hold significant promise but face challenges in structural instability and sluggish ion diffusion. This review focuses on entropy production PBAs (EP&#8208;PBAs) for non&#8208;monovalent ion (Zn2+, Al3+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) battery systems. Incorporating multiple transition metals into PBAs leverages entropy production effects to stabilize crystal structures, enhance ion diffusion kinetics, and improve cycling stability. Synthesis methods such as coprecipitation, electrochemical deposition, and hydrothermal techniques are compared, with coprecipitation emerging as the most scalable approach. Entropy engineering mitigates lattice distortion, reduces defects, and suppresses phase transitions, enabling EP&#8208;PBAs to achieve high specific capacities and long&#8208;term stability. Challenges including interfacial instability and synthesis complexity are discussed, alongside future directions in material optimization, electrolyte compatibility, and scalable production. This work highlights the potential of entropy&#8208;stabilized PBAs as next&#8208;generation cathodes for multivalent&#8208;ion batteries, advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One&#8208;Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic approach using copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) ring&#8208;closing strategies in relatively dilute conditions was used to make &#8220;click&#8221; [n]catenanes with open metal&#8208;binding sites at the ends for further growth. First, a [2]catenane was made at 82% yield using a slow&#8208;addition method. Then, a rapid&#8208;addition one&#8208;pot method was used to make a well&#8208;defined dispersity of [2]&#8211;[6]catenanes with an overall yield of 18%.








Abstract
Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain&#8208;like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that are distinct in comparison to traditional molecular architectures, a fact that makes catenanes potentially attractive building blocks in the construction of next&#8208;generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [n]catenanes are either low yielding or are laborious, often relying on multistep pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [n]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline&#8208;based building blocks and CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [n]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)&#8208;based templation and click chemistry, ultimately resulting in a one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to make either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well&#8208;defined linear [2]&#8211;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the alkyne&#8208; and azide&#8208;functionalized precursors (i.e., slowly or all at once). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway toward the preparation of higher&#8208;order [n]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.

     alt="Template-Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One-Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-pot synthetic approach using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) ring-closing strategies in relatively dilute conditions was used to make &#8220;click&#8221; [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes with open metal-binding sites at the ends for further growth. First, a [2]catenane was made at 82% yield using a slow-addition method. Then, a rapid-addition one-pot method was used to make a well-defined dispersity of [2]&#8211;[6]catenanes with an overall yield of 18%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain-like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that are distinct in comparison to traditional molecular architectures, a fact that makes catenanes potentially attractive building blocks in the construction of next-generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes are either low yielding or are laborious, often relying on multistep pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template-directed one-pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline-based building blocks and CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)-based templation and click chemistry, ultimately resulting in a one-pot synthetic strategy to make either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well-defined linear [2]&#8211;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the alkyne- and azide-functionalized precursors (i.e., slowly or all at once). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway toward the preparation of higher-order [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality Effects in Peptide&#8208;Based Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterochiral peptides are known to exhibit unique folding and self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Yet, the impact of heterochirality in peptide&#8208;based dynamic combinatorial chemistry remains largely unexplored. This study reveals that chirality effects can be used to increase diversity in dynamic combinatorial libraries, significantly enhancing the potential applications of these systems in the discovery of new drugs, biosensors, and adaptive materials.








Abstract
Naturally occurring peptides are almost exclusively composed of L&#8208;amino acids, and the incorporation of D&#8208;amino acids can profoundly alter their ability to fold and self&#8208;assemble. Here we explore the effects of chirality on the formation of disulfide dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) generated by short cysteine&#8208;rich peptides. Our findings consistently show that heterochiral tripeptides form more diverse DCLs than their homochiral counterparts. The most complex library appears to encompass all possible cyclic species up to 19mers. Given that each of these species exists as a mixture of parallel and antiparallel isomers, we estimate this library to contain a total of 2,045 distinct compounds&#8212;a remarkable result considering that the library generated by the analogous homochiral peptide predominantly contains two dimers. In certain situations, peptide chirality also affects the relative stability of parallel and antiparallel isomers. Taken together, these results show that small changes in peptide chirality can be dramatically amplified through the formation of cyclic species.

         <title>A ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase inhibitor that has antituberculosis and herbicidal activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione,&#160;1f&#160;is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;(Mt) KARI (Ki&#160;= 23.3 nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the&#160;MtKARI homolog from&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;(Sa),&#160;SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for&#160;Oryza sativa&#160;KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by&#160;1f&#160;is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146 nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties,&#160;1f&#160;has an MIC of 12.7 &#181;M for&#160;MtH37Rv and inhibits&#160;Brassica campestris&#160;growth by 63% at 10 mg/mL. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven electron transfer and subsequent multielectron storage is among the key aspects of photochemical reactions in artificial photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Following our previously introduced design and characterization of Ru(II)&#8208;based photosensitizers, four new Ru complexes with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands featuring a flavin&#8208;inspired subunit were investigated via density functional theory in order to evaluate their electrochemical properties ahead of a time and resource demanding synthesis. Two complexes, Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB and Ru&#8208;Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light&#8208;driven charge accumulation and synthesized subsequently. The electrochemical characterization of Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time&#8208;resolved emission and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly&#8208;reduced complex were modeled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. These results underline the promising multielectron storage capacity of the newly&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended alloxazine ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Nitrogen&#8208;doped Nb2C Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic ORR to Selectively Produce H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for H2O2 production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N&#8208;Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N&#8208;Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N&#8208;doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity for the isocoumarins over the corresponding phthalides.








Abstract
Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods for isocoumarins have been developed. However, the synthesis of isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2 fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2 into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2, which selectively produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity.

         <title>Flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for the capture of iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient materials for trapping radioactive iodine is essential for the safe use of nuclear energy. Herein, we present a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by exploiting the flexible building blocks with the affinity properties of electrically rich heteroatoms by combining the cyclic triphosphonitrile derivative, with amine linkers of different molecular lengths, and constructing triangular pore&#8208;structured flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks. A series of cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based COFs (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X=PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT) with triangular pore topology were synthesized usingCTP&#8208;6 as the node and connection point of p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA), 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 5,5&#8208;diamino2,2&#8208;bipyridine (BPY), and 4,4&#8208;diaminotribiphenyl (DPT) with different molecular lengths. It was found that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor were 4.65 g g&#8208;1, 4.18 g g&#8208;1, 2.38 g g&#8208;1 and 3.57 g g&#8208;1, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine in cyclohexane were 281.50 mg g&#8208;1, 221.67 mg g&#8208;1, 161.14 mg g&#8208;1, and 222.67 mg g&#8208;1, respectively. It was found that the four COFs adsorbed iodine in cyclohexane solution was a mixed adsorption process with chemical adsorption playing a predominant role and physical adsorption as an auxiliary mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Cyclopeptide&#8208;Based Chemical Models for Allosteric Disulfide and Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here designer water soluble triazolophanes as a platform for mimicking the allosteric disulfide conformation. The allosteric &#8208;LHHook disulfide conformation has been stabilized by a protein like intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The striking similarity of the fibrils of the designer macrocycle with amyloids and its autofluorescence is a noteworthy finding.








Abstract
We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.

         <title>ENHANCED POLYSULFIDE REGULATION IN RECHARGEABLE LI&#8208;S BATTERIES WITH ZnS AS ELECTROCATALYST: EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AND INTERFACIAL INSIGHTS FROM SIMULATIONS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (~80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as a Li&#8208;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8208;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted TzTz derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#215;&#215;&#215;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4 eV in solution and up to 1 eV in solid state, and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperbranched polysiloxanes are a class of nonconventional polymers with unique structural features and excellent physicochemical properties, which have attracted great attention in the field of luminescent materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in the study of luminescence mechanisms and optical properties of various hyperbranched polymers containing Si&#8208;O&#8208;C segments with Si as branching points, including hyperbranched polysiloxanes, hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes, and hyperbranched polysilphosphates. Through molecular design and structural regulation, researchers have successfully achieved multi&#8208;color fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission ranging from blue to red in these polymers, with quantum yields reaching up to 54.1% and fluorescence lifetimes up to 9.73 &#956;s. The AIE properties and excellent biocompatibility of these polymers provide new materials and strategies for applications in bioimaging, controlled drug release, information security encryption, and ion detection. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges for further development are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the polar conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light&#8208;blue over 720 h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the polar environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Intermolecular O&#8208;Peptidylation Protocol Enabled by Sequential Acyl Transfer on Thiol&#8208;Incorporated Threonine Followed by Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage intermolecular O&#8208;acylation of the threonine (Thr) side chain was accomplished by reacting thiol&#8208;incorporated Thr with a peptide thioester in open air. The thioester, which contained the volatile trifluoroethanethiol, facilitated the formation of S,O&#8208;diacyl peptides. These were subsequently converted into the desired O&#8208;acyl threonine isopeptide through silver&#8208;mediated thioester selective activation followed by desulfurization.








Abstract
The thiol functionality on the methyl group of a threonine derivative [Thr(SH)] facilitates O&#8208;acylation of the Thr hydroxy group with a thioester. We previously showed that a Thr(SH)&#8208;incorporated peptide thioester can be converted to the corresponding Thr&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptide through intramolecular thioester exchange (S&#9472;S acyl transfer) and subsequent desulfurization of the O&#8208;acyl peptide resulting from intramolecular S&#9472;O acyl transfer. Based on our success in depsipeptide synthesis, we applied the Thr(SH)&#8208;facilitated protocol to the synthesis of branched O&#8208;acyl isopeptides. Initial attempts identified two issues. First, the S&#8208;acylation step with a thioester proceeds in an entropically preferential manner in cyclic depsipeptide synthesis, but not in the case of branched isopeptides. Using a highly volatile thiol component in the thioester solved this issue. Second, the intermolecular thioester change step was accompanied by the formation of an S,O&#8208;diacyl intermediate as a major component; this issue was solved by using thioester&#8208;selective activation of the diacyl species with silver(I) salt followed by desulfurization. Ultimately, the optimized Thr(SH)&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;acylation of a Thr residue in peptide sequences. We show that the protocol has wide substrate scope and demonstrate its application to ubiquitination of the Thr residue of HOIL&#8208;1 peptide.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, we summarize&#160;the recent advances in the total synthesis of specific cembranoid and norcembranoid diterpenoids, including pavidolide B, scabrolide A, nominal scabrolide B, havellockate, ineleganolide, sinulochmodin C, rameswaralide, scabrolide B, sinuscalide C, horiolide, and fragilolide A. Notably, we showcase the bio&#8208;inspired transformations and highlight the latest breakthroughs in the total synthesis of these natural products.








Abstract
The C19 norcembranoid and C20 cembranoid diterpenoids represent an intriguing class of natural products found in both marine and terrestrial environments. These complexes, with a highly oxygenated state and compact polycyclic structures, have captured the synthetic interests due to their unique bioactivities. Over the past two decades, the total synthesis of these natural products has been a challenging task, driven by their intricate structural features. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in the total synthesis of various norcembranoid and cembranoid diterpenoids, focusing on their transformations and the latest breakthroughs in this field.

We present high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR spectroscopy studies on a series of pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidally coordinated ErIII(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X complexes with different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) to directly determine the electronic properties of the ground state and low&#8208;energy Kramers doublets, namely effective g&#8208;tensors and zero field splittings. Our findings are compared to the results of numerical studies and are used to rationalise the observed differences in magnetic relaxation behavior.








Abstract
High&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field electron paramagnetic resonance studies on a series of seven&#8208;coordinate pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal (PBP) erbium(III) complexes Er(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X (H2DAPMBH&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diacetylpyridine bis&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy benzoylhydrazone, H4DAPS&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diacetylpyridine bis&#8208;(salicylhydrazone)) demonstrate the effects of different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) on the local magnetic anisotropy of the central ErIII ions. In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective g&#8208;values and zero field splittings of the energetically low&#8208;lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial g&#8208;tensor for SMM behavior and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low&#8208;lying excited states.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dicyanation of Alkenes Enabled by Phosphorus Radical Cation Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic strategy for the direct dicyanation of styrenes with TMSCN. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation, enabling the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes. Further synthetic transformations of these dinitrile motifs and mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway have been demonstrated.








Abstract
While notable progress has been made in alkene cyanation for the synthesis of alkyl nitriles, catalytic strategies enabling the direct dicyanation of simple alkenes remain relatively under&#8208;explored. In this study, we introduce a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic system that facilitates the direct dicyanation of styrenes using TMSCN in the presence of oxidant. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation. This protocol allows for the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes under mild conditions. Notably, the method exhibits broad substrate scope and commendable efficiency, serving as a valuable complement to existing cyanation methodologies. The synthetic utility of the dinitrile products is further demonstrated through diverse derivatization reactions, highlighting their applicability in constructing nitrogen&#8208;rich molecular architectures. Mechanistic studies provide further insight into the reaction pathway and underscore the potential of phosphorus radical cations in alkene functionalization.

Notably, the method exhibits broad substrate scope and commendable efficiency, serving as a valuable complement to existing cyanation methodologies. The synthetic utility of the dinitrile products is further demonstrated through diverse derivatization reactions, highlighting their applicability in constructing nitrogen-rich molecular architectures. Mechanistic studies provide further insight into the reaction pathway and underscore the potential of phosphorus radical cations in alkene functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Convergent Approach to Resorcinolic Macrolides to Expand Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and enantioselective approach to resorcinolic macrolides enables targeted C15 modifications, macrocycle rigidity, and a novel cyclic peptide hybrid strategy to tune ATP&#8208;binding site selectivity. Structural alterations enhance Hsp90 paralog inhibition, introduce covalent warheads for GRP94, and reveal new inhibitors of KRasG12C, expanding ATP&#8208;mimetic chemical space for drug discovery.








Abstract
The resorcinolic macrolide (RM) family comprises over 50 natural products with diverse biological activities, including the potent natural Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Here, we report a modular and enantioselective synthetic strategy featuring a biomimetic macrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade that enables rapid access to natural and unnatural RMs. Using this route, we generated a small panel of minimal RMs, introducing covalent warheads, double bonds for macrocycle rigidification, and modifications at the C15 position, a position that has not been modified before. We also synthesized macrocyclic peptide&#8208;RM hybrids, offering a platform for rapid diversification. We evaluated all analogs for inhibitory activity against Hsp90&#945; and Hsp90&#946; and for disruption of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI). We found that introduction of polar groups at C15 improved Hsp90 activity relative to the representative RM de&#8208;O&#8208;methyllasiodiplodin, dependent on stereochemistry, whereas introduction of larger groups at C15 or introduction of a trans double bond into the macrocycle reduced activity. Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.

         <title>Organocatalytic Switches of DNA Glycosylase OGG1 Catalyze a Highly Efficient AP&#8208;Lyase Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic switches are small molecules that combine active site affinity and a nitrogen&#8208;centered base for catalysis, effectively removing the rate&#8208;determining step of the OGG1 biochemical cascade. Here, we identify a minimal structure and modulate the active nitrogen pKa, enabling the catalysis of ultrafast AP site incisions in a range of pH environments. Importantly, improved compounds exhibit potent anti&#8208;fibrotic effects in a patient&#8208;derived model of MASH.








Abstract
8&#8208;oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8&#8208;oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pKa is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches&#8211;4&#8208;anilino pyridines and 6&#8208;anilino pyrimidines&#8211;which are dimethyl&#8208;amino&#8208;pyridine (DMAP)&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) and electron&#8208;donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pKa less or equal to the assay pH is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC50 13&#160;nM, pKa 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient&#8208;derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.

         <title>Sulfate Recognition in Water via Charge&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dicationic tetralactam macrocycle achieves selective sulfate recognition in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism enabled by electrostatic complementarity and desolvation. This work offers design principles for developing aqueous&#8208;phase receptors for sensing, separation, and catalysis.








Abstract
Achieving selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic anions in water remains a formidable challenge due to the competitive nature of water and the high hydration energies of target anions such as sulfate. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a simple dicationic tetralactam macrocycle (BPTL2&#8314;&#183;2Cl&#8315;) capable of binding highly hydrated anions in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal that BPTL2&#8314; exhibits a strong binding affinity for sulfate (Ka&#160;=&#160;2892&#160;M&#8315;&#185;), driven primarily by entropic gain from water release and reinforced by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;optimized structures confirm the formation of directional [N&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] and [C&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] hydrogen bonds. Comparative studies with a control macrocycle (6Na+&#8226;HCTL6&#8722;) that has a charge&#8208;neutral binding cavity underscore the essential role of cationic charge in overcoming desolvation enthalpic penalties. The receptor displays anti&#8208;Hofmeister selectivity, preferentially binding more hydrophilic anions. This work provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of anion recognition in water. It establishes charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding as a powerful strategy for developing next&#8208;generation receptors for sensing, separation, sequestration, transport, and catalysis in aqueous environments.

         <title>Formation Of Gold&#8208;Astatine Bonds in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the search for alternatives to the traditional astatoaryl bond, Au(I)&#9472;NHC complex was successfully radiolabeled with 211At by halide exchange and showed promising stability in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Mass spectrometry experiments coupled with relativistic DFT calculations support the superiority of Au(I) over Rh(I) and Ir(I) and give insights into the role of the NHC ligand in order to access stable 211At&#8208;compounds.








Abstract
With the purpose of exploring alternatives to the poorly stable astatoaryl bond found in most 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the coordination between astatine and metal&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes was investigated. To orient this work, relativistic DFT calculations were performed, highlighting a superiority of gold(I) over rhodium(I) and iridium(I), both regarding the strength of the metal&#8208;astatine bond and the metal's preference for astatine over other halogens. The DFT calculations also revealed a more stable metal&#8208;astatine bond with electron&#8208;withdrawing NHCs. Accordingly, two Au(I) complexes, [AuCl(IPr)] (IPr&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and [AuCl(IAd)] (IAd&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[adamantyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were radiolabeled by halide exchange in excellent radiochemical yields with iodine&#8208;125 and astatine&#8208;211 in a water/acetonitrile mixture with a reducing agent. While the adamantyl&#8208;substituted complex was not investigated further due to its lack of solubility in aqueous or semi aqueous media, the stability of [Au211At(IPr)] in the presence of phosphate&#8208;buffered saline was evaluated and proved excellent (96% after two half&#8208;lives), encouraging further studies with relevant cancer&#8208;targeting vectors.

         <title>Hybrid pH Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Through the Combination of the Ureido&#8211;Pyrimidinone Motif with &#946;&#8208;Sheet Peptide Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone motif with two different &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide sequences yielded supramolecular structures with significantly different morphologies in water. The resulting supramolecular nanostructures showed structural stability between pH = 5 and 9, while precipitation occurred at pH = 3.0 and random coil formation at pH 12. This work poses the basis for the development of novel responsive supramolecular polymers.








Abstract
Supramolecular biomaterials based on 1D supramolecular polymers in water replicate the fibrous and dynamic structures of natural architectures. Peptides, valued for their biocompatibility, are commonly employed as building blocks for supramolecular biomaterials, often in combination with large aromatic or hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups at the N&#8208;terminus to improve their structural stability. Herein, the self&#8208;assembly properties of two &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides combined with the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone self&#8208;dimerizing motif in aqueous solution are investigated in detail. The assembly of the resulting molecules is demonstrated to be intimately dependent on the &#946;&#8208;sheet sequence, while the incorporation of a hydrophobic spacer enhances the assembly of the monomers, irrespective of the peptide sequence employed. Furthermore, the assembly of each monomer is significantly enhanced at pH = 3.0 while being stable between pH = 5.0 and 9.0. Only at pH = 12, upon enolate formation, the transition to random coil conformation is observed for all the monomers. The supramolecular polymers developed hereby point to fundamental design principle toward the development of UPy&#8208;peptide based materials with tuneable properties and potential applications in the biomedical fields of research.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Bismuthinidenes: Double C(sp3)&#9472;I Bond Activation Using Single or Two Bi Centers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study illustrating a tunable reactivity for bismuthinidene complexes toward dihalomethanes is presented. Two types of double activation of C(sp3)&#9472;I bonds of diiodomethane were observed depending on the structure of the ligand. When a Dipp group was present on the nitrogen, the first C&#9472;I bond underwent oxidative addition (OA) toward the bismuth followed by alkylation of the imine function in cooperation with the ligand, whereas a double OA of two C&#9472;I bonds toward two bismuthinidene centers was observed for the tBu analogue.








Abstract
The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#9472;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#9472;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X&#9552;I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#9472;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#9472;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate, and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates bearing functional groups of amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) were synthesized and used for enzymatic synthesis of hypermodified DNA displaying these substituents in the major groove mimicking peptides or proteins.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or, (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two, or three nonsulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.

         <title>From Desferrioxamine B Umpolung to an Enantiopure Bifunctional Chelator for 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional group transformations were performed at the pendent amine residue of desferrioxamine B (DFO), the commercial siderophore used in various medical applications, including iron decorporation, antibiotic development, and molecular imaging. Our results will broaden the scope of reactions, so far restricted to amide bond formation, for the functionalization of DFO with, for example, a chromophore, an additional ligand, a bioconjugable spacer.








Abstract
Promising results in preclinical diagnosis based on 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET have fostered the development of efficient chelators for this tetravalent metal. Leads in this area are octadentate ligands obtained by extension of the desferrioxamine B trihydroxamic acid DFO with a fourth bidentate ligand. In the approach reported here, the latter is a natural 6&#8208;membered cyclic hydroxamic acid deriving from (L)&#8208;ornithine. Its coupling to DFO via an (L)&#8208;lysine spacer required that the genuine amine function of the DFO terminus be changed to a carboxylic acid. Such a requirement prompted us to explore short sequences of chemical transformations that would challenge total syntheses leading to the same products. As a matter of fact, the target C&#8208;terminal DFO analogue was obtained in benzyl&#8208;protected form in three steps from commercially available DFO in 16% overall yield. Our short&#8208;step approach allowed us to implement other functionalities without DFO extension: &#8208;OH, &#8208;OTs, &#8208;CHO, &#8208;C(O)CH3, and &#8208;CH&#9552;CH2.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: from Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts. After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of organic photocatalysts employed in solution, or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Decarbonylation of a Metal Phosphaketene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene by reaction of the known cobalt(I) phosphaketene complex Co(DippPDI)(PCO) (DippPDI = 1,1'&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine) with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P=Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The novel phosphaketene compounds (IDipp)Au(PCO) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and (DippNacNac)Zn(PCO) (DippNacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) can be synthesized by reaction of Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} with Au(IDipp)Cl or (DippNacNac)ZnCl&#183;LiCl(OEt2)2, respectively. In the case of the former, the released stannylene Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 ultimately inserts into the Au&#8211;PCO bond affording the tin(IV) complex (IDipp)AuSn(PCO)[CH(SiMe3)2]2.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Thiol&#8208;ene Mediated Protocol for Thiolated Peptide Synthesis and On&#8208;Resin Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfhydryl groups unique nucleophilic and redox properties render it highly useful as a synthetic handle for the diversification of peptide structure, including macrocyclization, ligation, and bioconjugation. Herein, we demonstrated a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selectively installing thiol residues onto bioactive peptides on&#8208;resin. Through judicious placement of appropriate unsaturated residues, the hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic tool to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of disulfide&#8208;containing peptides displaying different ring sizes. Furthermore, a new and generally applicable fluorescent labeling strategy is introduced to facilitate direct on&#8208;resin conjugation without intermediate purification steps. These new methods provide a robust and versatile platform for peptide macrocyclization and bioconjugation, with broad applications in peptide synthesis and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridyl/Phenyl&#8208;Appended Acrylonitrile &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules: Thermally Stable Organic Crystals for Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly solid&#8208;state emissive molecular crystals have attracted attention as gain media for organic lasers. There is a need to develop solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules with excellent solubility and thermal stability through chemical design approaches despite the structural and functional diversity of organic molecular materials toward such media. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of the t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl or phenyl&#8208;appended CDSBs. A solution process at room temperature could prepare each crystal of these molecules modified with pyridyl/phenyl. The crystal structure analysis results suggest that the difference in the pyridyl/phenyl group affects the crystal system. Solid&#8208;state emissions were similar due to the molecular structural differences affecting only the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of the crystal exhibited amplified spontaneous emission properties with the formation of population inversion. However, the pyridyl&#8211;pyridyl interactions contributed to the thermal stability of the crystal, which was stable even under high energy density laser irradiation. Therefore, molecular modification with the pyridyl group offers a new strategy for controlling crystal structures and rigid frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Activity in Fluorinated Binolate Ytterbium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral lanthanide complexes hold great potential in developing advanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. While various ligands, such as &#946;&#8208;diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air&#8208;stable Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8217;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (&#964;obs), sensitization efficiency (&#951;sens) and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 &#956;s, 38% and 0.7% to 2.7 &#956;s, 63% and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963 nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad,&#160;encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although soluble support (tag)&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase methods have found practical applications in peptide synthesis, they are still in their infancy for oligonucleotide synthesis. The development of techniques for selective tag cleavage with protective groups remaining is particularly important because such techniques are necessary to realize a convergent approach. Herein, we report an effective soluble support&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag that can be prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remaining are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which is necessary to realize a convergent approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Cage Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cages are a robust class of molecular hosts with a myriad of applications in materials science. Despite this, there has been a paucity of explorations into the modification of their properties via external functionalization. In this work, [n]rotaxanes featuring unoccupied organic cages as stopper components and a small 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle were constructed using the active metal template approach. By exploiting a scrambling methodology, it was possible to synthesise cages with a defined number of interlocked components (n = 2&#8208;4). The gas uptake, solubility and thermal properties of the interlocked systems were compared against those of their constituent, non&#8208;interlocked components. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate the potential of exploiting the mechanical bond for modulating the physiochemical properties of these molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of amines into peptides via an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence provides access to a wide variety of modifications, including amine&#8208;based metal ligands. Primary, secondary, and aromatic amines, as well as heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles, have been successfully incorporated into the reaction sequence. Particularly basic amines or ammonium chlorides can also be used successfully with acid or base additives.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics, for example, for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines, and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal&#8208;binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30&#160;K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Fluorescent Probe for Lipid Droplets and Endoplasmic Reticulum Using Bay&#8208;Region Substituted Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the complex cellular microenvironment, lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Their interactions are crucial for regulating processes such as lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, simultaneously monitoring these two organelles remains a challenging task. In this study, a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted perylene diimides (PDIs) based probe, LD&#8208;ER&#8208;PDI, by incorporating a 2&#8208;azetidinone substituent in the bay&#8208;region and two distinct targeting groups for LDs and ER at opposite ends of the imide positions was development, enabling discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid&#8208;treated conditions and also allows real&#8208;time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER. This work not only provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamic interactions between LDs and ER but also highlights a strategy for designing dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling CoOx@NC&#160;with NiFe LDH Enhances Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Rechargeable High&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale composite of NiFe LDH nanosheets anchored on Co&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich carbon and interconnected CNT framework ((CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe), prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal route, exhibits excellent OER and ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, which is comparable to and even exceeds that of representative bifunctional electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional catalysts with the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities is of great significance in improving the efficiency of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, this study adopts simple one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal strategies to prepare a high&#8208;performance bifunctional composite catalyst by coupling a layered hydroxide NiFe LDH with Co and N codoped carbon framework, composed of cobalt oxide and metallic Co nanoparticles distributed on interconnected porous carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Benefiting from the exposure of more active sites, high conductivity, and beneficial charge transport advantages, the best catalyst (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability for oxygen&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, exhibiting a low potential gap of 0.757&#160;V. Additionally, the rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with the (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a specific capacity of 803&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and outstanding stability (over 200&#160;hours). This work presents a simple and low&#8208;cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assemblies of a concaved aromatic host as electron donor (D) and a cationic heterocyclic guest as electron acceptor (A) are reported. These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT co&#8208;crystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions but also coulomb interaction between cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D&#8208;A fragments. Owing to the strong D&#8208;A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manupulating electron transition dynamics.</dc:description>

Bifunctional Chiral ImPy&#8208;Carbene Ligands. H&#8208;Bonding Controlled Reactivity and Enantioselectivity in Au(I)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands have been devised for enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. Based on a single C&#8208;stereogenic center derived from chiral pool &#945;&#8208;aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2&#8208;naphthol and 1,6&#8208;enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl&#8208;fused 6&#8208;ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan&#8208;fused products. This unusual selectivity was investigated by DFT studies, which suggested the dual role of the carbonyl group of the urea moiety: first as H&#8208;bond acceptor in the catalytic cycle to direct the enantioselectivity, second as a cooperative group in the hydrogen shift leading to deauration.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Driven Ion Pumps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8217;s molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light&#8208;driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric&#8208;driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light&#8208;induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light&#8208;driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method to transform 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones and anthrones has been developed using Tf2O as an inexpensive and readily available mediator via unusual intramolecular rearrangement. This work expands the utility of Tf2O in complex molecular transformations and offers valuable contributions to the synthesis of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional Chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

         <title>The Evolution of Fluorescein into A Potential Theranostic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study successfully evolved a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic compound. By functionalizing fluorescein, we enhanced its fluorescence and adapted it for multicomponent reactions (MCRs). We synthesized over 20 compounds across four diverse scaffolds. Compound 5e shows strong 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibition, favorable properties and cell permeability, making it ideal for imaging and screening assays.








Abstract
Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds. This approach ultimately led to the development of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable inhibitor that effectively engages its target in live cells and enables real&#8208;time visualization. These findings validate our new strategy for the development of small molecule diagnostic modulators, paving the way for application in other targets as well.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel and multifunctional heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters have been reported. Notably, these heterometallic clusters show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.








Abstract
Three heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters with the formulas [LnIII2CoII5(L1)2(L2)2(L3)2(OAc)4(NO3)2]&#183;4CH3CN (LnIII&#160;=&#160;Gd (1), Tb (2), and Dy (3); HL1 = (E)&#8208;1&#8208;((2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxybenzylidene)amino)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, HL2&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;aminonaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, and HL3&#160;=&#160;trimethylopropane) have been obtained via self&#8208;assembly of mixed ligands strategy. Significantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm&#160;=&#160;36.83&#160;J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0&#160;K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8211;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework&#8211;Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reviews recent advances in COF&#8208;based ionic conductors for PEMFCs, covering their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies for enhancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability are analyzed, along with challenges in membrane durability and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton&#8208;conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.

Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF-modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high-temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost-effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next-generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton-conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and iso(thio)cyanates, to afford the corresponding adducts. Intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified through natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis based on their X&#8208;ray crystal structures. The potential of these adducts as electrophilic aminating reagents was demonstrated.








Abstract
The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N&#8208;acyliminothianthrenes as N&#8208;acylnitrene equivalents was demonstrated.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted N&#8208;Isopropylacrylamide Nanogel Synthesis: Exploring the Role of Reaction Parameters and Cross&#8208;linking Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as an efficient method for preparing PNIPAM based nanogels. Using crosslinkers like EGDMA and BAC, their effects on structure, temperature responsiveness, and stability were analyzed. Microwave irradiation shows its potential in nanogel synthesis. Stability studies in biologically relevant media highlight their potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
This study provides a detailed account of the use of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as a novel and efficient method for preparing monodisperse poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanogels. The synthesis, based on free radical precipitation copolymerization of NIPAM and crosslinkers in water, was accelerated by microwave irradiation. Crosslinkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and degradable bis&#8208;acryloylcystamine (BAC) were employed to study their effects on nanogel structure and properties, including their temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. HPLC analysis revealed differences in monomer and crosslinker conversion between the two agents. The growth of the nanogel particles was analyzed at various polymerization times using dynamic light scattering (DLS), &#950;&#8208;potential measurements, and cryo&#8208;TEM imaging. The data showed that microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis reduced reaction time from 6 hours to minutes. BAC produced uniformly cross&#8208;linked nanogels, whereas EGDMA formed nanogels with dense cores and loose PNIPAM shells. Stability studies during storage and in biologically relevant media indicated their potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and Their Phase&#8208;Dependent Structure: A Multi&#8208;Technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of flexible bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722; are dimeric in the crystalline state but rearrange to monomeric in organic solution. The transformation, first detected on paramagnetic VO2+ and Co2+ derivatives, is conclusively proved through the preparation of diamagnetic [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] and its investigation by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2.








Abstract
Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8722; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8722; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2 contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.

Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox system enables the regioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles via C(sp3)&#9472;H bond functionalization. This method bypasses traditional Sn2 pathways and offers complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis. The approach shows good substrate scope and high yields, with mechanistic studies supporting the arylation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).








Abstract
In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#9472;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.

         <title>Formation of Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;Like Polyoxidovanadates at 37&#176;C Upon Reaction of VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 With Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At physiological temperature in NaCl solutions, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] reacts with lysozyme forming mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates which covalently bind to the protein surface.








Abstract
Crystals of the model protein lysozyme were grown and soaked with the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 at 37&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data collected at this temperature reveal that mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadate clusters are formed and covalently bind protein residue side chains at physiological temperature.

         <title>Selective Sequestration of Palladium(II) Cations Using a Supramolecular Polymer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;based ligand is shown to selectively complex Pd(II) cations from an aqueous mixed&#8208;metal solution. Selectivity for Pd(II) is imparted in a copolymer when functionalized with the same ligand, demonstrating the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in metal recovery systems.








Abstract
The selective sequestration of aqueous palladium from waste is an attractive option for metal recovery. However, achieving good metal specificity remains a difficult problem. In this study, we present the synthesis of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular system based on a 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating ligand group. Excellent selectivity for Pd(II) ions over Pt(II), Ni(II), Fe(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) from a mixed&#8208;metal solution was demonstrated through ESI&#8208;MS and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of a model ligand system. Following this, a water&#8208;soluble copolymer system containing 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole functional groups was prepared. This polymer was shown to exhibit the same specificity for Pd(II) in a mixed&#8208;metal solution, quantitatively supported by dialysis and ICP&#8208;MS experiments. These findings demonstrate the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in selective metal recovery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Detergent Chemistry and Handling Support Membrane Protein Analysis Including Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ionic detergents are key reagents for the characterization of membrane protein drug targets. Suitable detergents are commonly identified by trial and error, which leads to failed preparations and raising costs. Recent findings suggest that not only the chemistry of detergents but also the strategy with which detergents and proteins are brought together impact the successes of investigations. To facilitate the future development of non&#8208;ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G&#8208;protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein&#8208;lipid binding, top&#8208;down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non&#8208;canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fascinating properties introduced by the breaking of the mirror symmetry have recently motivated a rising interest in chirality in nanomaterials. In particular, transition metal dichalcogenides are a wide group of technologically relevant two&#8208;dimensional layered materials where recent efforts in the introduction of chirality have shown promising results, attracting great attention for future studies and potential applications. This review article is focused on the development of chirality in transition metal dichalcogenide nanostructures, dealing with the synthetic strategies that have been adopted to produce chiral TMDs both via solution&#8208;phase and vapor&#8208;phase syntheses along with the characterization of their chiroptical properties. A broad range of examples, including a variety of nanostructures such as 0D quantum dots, 1D nanotubes, 2D flakes and more complex 3D nanostructures as well as different origins of the chirality are considered. Critical analysis of potential pitfalls in the assessment of the materials&#8217; chirality are discussed. A broad range of exciting properties and applications associated with the materials&#8217; chirality, including: nanomedicine, enantioselective catalysis, spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, spintronics and non&#8208;linear optics are also presented in the review.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible, Perfluorinated Analogue of Aluminum Fumarate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis of Al&#8208;TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H2TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H2O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved ab&#8208;initio from laboratory powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, displays structural analogies with that of the commercially available Al&#8208;fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH&#8208;bridged Al octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of ultra&#8208;micropores with a size lower than 4 &#197;. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al&#8208;TFS a slightly higher CO2 selectivity compared to N2 and CH4 than the Al&#8208;fumarate analogue, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO2 adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallisation&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has been extensively studied for the formation of bespoke nanoparticles and provides a unique way to control the unidirectional growth of block copolymers (BCPs). Currently, oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles represent an under&#8208;researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesising organic nanoparticles with higher&#8208;order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self&#8208;assembly of polyester&#8208;based BCPs in n&#8208;octane to achieve low&#8208;dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tuneable, oil&#8208;soluble polymers and aims to understand their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane through the variation of self&#8208;assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine&#8208;Based Copper(II) Coordination Polymers with Remarkable Dynamic Properties, Selective Volatile Organic Compounds Adsorption and Exchange Capabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents novel Cu(II)&#8208;based bispidine coordination polymers (CPs) with remarkable dynamic properties, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exchange and selective adsorption capabilities. The coordination requirements of Cu(II) enable, as demonstrated by SC&#8208;XRD and P&#8208;XRD, the formation of either 1D ribbon&#8208;like (1&#8208;TCMSC and 1&#8208;H2OSC) and 2D (1&#8208;MeCNSC) extended frameworks depending on the ability of&#160;trapped solvents to interact as hydrogen bond (HB) donor with the metal&#160;counterion. Hirshfeld Surface analysis and in situ VT SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD experiments reveal different interchain interactions in 1D vs. 2D CPs. Solvent exchange experiments on both single crystals and microcrystalline samples, set up to evaluate differences in the CPs&#160;dynamic nature, confirm the drastic effect of CP dimensionality. Additionally, amorphous desolvated phase 1&#8208;AmorphPwd was tested for VOC adsorption displaying affinity for acetonitrile and nitromethane, with high selectivity for the latter, but also having the ability to trap aromatic VOCs, capturing up to ca. 2 mmol/g of solvent. The adsorption experiments, conducted at r.t., 1 atm and no prior activation, underscore the potential of these materials for environmental and industrial applications. This work emphasizes the unique dynamic and selective behavior of bispidine&#8208;based CPs and provides foundation for their scalability and practical implementation in VOC capture technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix Isolation and Solvation of the Benzonitrile Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvated electrons, one of the strongest reducing agents, exhibit short lifetimes in the range of pico&#8208; to milliseconds when generated photochemically or by radiolysis in solution. In contrast, solvated electrons produced using sodium metal in liquid ammonia are stable for days and have long been used in synthetic chemistry. Using sodium atoms as an electron source, we were able to trap solvated electrons in low&#8208;density amorphous (LDA) water ice matrices with lifetimes of several days and use these electrons as reducing reagent. In LDA matrices doped with benzonitrile 1 these electrons react with 1 to form the benzonitrile radical anion 2. In argon matrices, in the absence of water, only small amounts of 2 were observed after deposition, and most of the sodium and 1 remained unreacted. The yield of radical anion 2 is significantly higher in amorphous water ice than in solid argon. The photoexcitation of radical anion 2 in both argon and LDA water ice matrices resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer under back formation of benzonitrile 1. Annealing of argon matrices doped with small amounts of water containing 2 resulted in the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes between water and radical anion 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization, Fragmentation and Expansion of cyclo&#8208;P4R2 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, three isolobal complexes of the form [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8209;P4R2)]+ ({LnM}&#160;= {CpMo(CO)2} (A), {Cp'''Ni} (B), {Cp'''Co}&#8211; (C), R = Ph, iPr; Cp''' = 1,2,4&#8209;tBu3C5H2) are reacted with nucleophilic carbenes (L). While C does not show any reactivity, the cationic complexes A and B undergo addition reactions. The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (1a &#8211; d) and [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (3a &#8211; d) show different geometries for L&#8208;P3PR2 ligands. Their reactivity towards EtO&#8211; results in either a simple addition (for 1) or a complex addition, ring&#8208;opening, rearrangement sequence (for 3). Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(&#951;2&#8208;IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso&#8208;tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}&#8211; transition metal units. Lastly, 3a&#8211;d were chosen as model substrates for further nucleophilic functionalization. In this regard, 3 reacts with [CN]&#8208; in a [3+1] fragmentation reaction affording the dimerized species [{Cp'''Ni}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4(PR2)2)] (6a: R = Ph, 6b: R&#160;=&#160;iPr) together with IDippP&#8208;CN. In contrast, the reaction with [ECO]&#8208; (E = P, As) led to an extension of the pnictogen framework yielding [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;EP4Ph2IDipp)] (8a: E = P, 8b: E = As).</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP), as a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, its key challenge is to construct photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark. Herein, four cases of transition metal and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials to be used in the PECCP field for the first time.Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8722;465 mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175 mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97 mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stably and sustainably cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.</dc:description>
