         <title>Urea&#8208;Substituted Tetramethylcyclopentadienyl Ligands for Supramolecularly Accelerated RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H Olefination of Benzoic Acid Derivatives</title>

Supramolecular chemistry: The design and synthesis of urea&#8208;substituted RhIII&#8208;cyclopentadienyl catalysts, which accelerate the C&#8722;H olefination of benzoic acid derivatives, is reported. The catalysts&#8217; substrate recognition ability mediated by H&#8208;bonding is identified to be the reason for this effect. Its application to a variety of substrates proves the catalyst system's advantages compared to the results obtained with widely used [RhCp*Cl2]2.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of air&#8208;stable and conveniently crystallizable RhIII&#8208;cyclopentadienyl catalysts substituted with a urea moiety, which are able to accelerate the C&#8722;H olefination of benzoic acid derivatives, is reported. Through kinetic studies and NMR titration experiments, the catalysts&#8217; substrate recognition ability mediated by hydrogen bonding was identified to be the reason for this effect. Introduction of pyridone&#8208;phosphine ligands capable of forming additional H&#8208;bond interactions increased the catalytic performance even further. By unveiling a proportionality between reaction rate and relative complex formation enthalpy the hypothesis of a supramolecular catalyst preformation was supported. Its application to a variety of substrates proved the catalyst system's advantages, generally increasing the yields when compared to the results obtained with widely used [RhCp*Cl2]2.

         <title>Cover Feature: Water Formation in Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Sol&#8211;Gel Routes: Selective Synthesis of Tetragonal and Monoclinic Mesoporous Zirconia as a Case Study (Chem. Eur. J. 8/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2553-2553, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel: In situ water formation during the synthesis of mesoporous zirconia has been systematically investigated. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones and of ZrCl4 with alcohols or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether were strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Water played a major role on the structure of the final zirconia: tetragonal ZrO2 was favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while monoclinic ZrO2 was favored in the presence of water. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;H. Mutin et&#8197;al. on page 2670.

The photo&#8208;induced formation of a quartet state in a molecular conjugate consisting of a porphyrin and a trityl moiety is depicted in the cover image. Such photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for applications in quantum information technology, artificial photosynthesis, as well as spin catalysis. The quartet state formation was scrutinised by femtosecond UV/Vis absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, providing unique insight into the excited state reaction mechanism. Image design by Niklas Markloff, with contributions from Oliver Nolden. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Richert et&#8197;al. on page 2683.

         <title>Synthesis of Asparagine Derivatives Harboring a Lewis X Type DC&#8208;SIGN Ligand and Evaluation of their Impact on Immunomodulation in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2742-2752, February 5, 2021. </description>

Immunomodulation. A novel asparagine solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis building block harboring a Lewis X type DC&#8208;SIGN ligand has been synthesized (see scheme) and incorporated into the immunodominant portion of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG31&#8208;55). This glycopeptide was evaluated for its ability to inhibit citrullination&#8208;induced aggregation of MOG35&#8208;55, to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in vitro and for its immunomodulatory effects on human dendritic cells, with the Lewis X yielding a tolerogenic response.







Abstract
The protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key component of myelin and an autoantigen in the disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Post&#8208;translational N&#8208;glycosylation of Asn31 of MOG seems to play a key role in modulating the immune response towards myelin. This is mediated by the interaction of Lewis&#8208;type glycan structures in the N&#8208;glycan of MOG with the DC&#8208;SIGN receptor on dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report the synthesis of an unnatural Lewis X (LeX)&#8208;containing Fmoc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;compatible asparagine building block (SPPS=solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis), as well as asparagine building blocks containing two LeX&#8208;derived oligosaccharides: LacNAc and Fuc&#945;1&#8208;3GlcNAc. These building blocks were used for the glycosylation of the immunodominant portion of MOG (MOG31&#8208;55) and analyzed with respect to their ability to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in different biological setups, as well as their ability to inhibit the citrullination&#8208;induced aggregation of MOG31&#8208;55. Finally, a cytokine secretion assay was carried out on human monocyte&#8208;derived DCs, which showed the ability of the neoglycopeptide decorated with a single LeX to alter the balance of pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, inducing a tolerogenic response.

A supramolecular peptide&#8208;based bio&#8208;inspired systems have been built on gold surface. The effect of pH on the peptide conformation and on the ability of the film to generate photocurrent was investigated. In particular, at low pH, the photon to current conversion efficiency obtained is the highest value recorded so far with biomolecular systems.







Abstract
External stimuli are potent tools that Nature uses to control protein function and activity. For instance, during viral entry and exit, pH variations are known to trigger large protein conformational changes. In Nature, also the electron transfer (ET) properties of ET proteins are influenced by pH&#8208;induced conformational changes. In this work, a pH&#8208;controlled, reversible 310&#8208;helix to &#945;&#8208;helix conversion (from acidic to highly basic pH values and vice versa) of a peptide supramolecular system built on a gold surface is described. The effect of pH on the ability of the peptide SAM to generate a photocurrent was investigated, with particular focus on the effect of the pH&#8208;induced conformational change on photocurrent efficiency. The films were characterized by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, and were found to be very stable over time, also in contact with a solution. They were also able to generate current under illumination, with an efficiency that is the highest recorded so far with biomolecular systems.

         <title>Water Formation in Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Sol&#8211;Gel Routes: Selective Synthesis of Tetragonal and Monoclinic Mesoporous Zirconia as a Case Study</title>

Water in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel: Monitoring in situ water formation in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel routes to mesoporous zirconia shows that it impacts not only the mechanism of the sol&#8211;gel process but also the structure of the final material.







Abstract
Several non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel syntheses involving different precursors, oxygen donors, and conditions have been screened aiming to selectively produce mesoporous t&#8208;ZrO2 or m&#8208;ZrO2 with significant specific surface areas. The in situ water formation was systematically investigated by Karl Fisher titration of the syneresis liquids. XRD and nitrogen physisorption were employed to characterize the structure and texture of the ZrO2 samples. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones (acetone, 2&#8208;pentanone, acetophenone), and of ZrCl4 with alcohols (benzyl alcohol, ethanol) or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether appear strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Although reaction time and reaction temperature were also important parameters, the presence of water played a crucial role on the structure of the final zirconia: t&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while m&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in the presence of significant amounts of water. 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of the syneresis liquids allowed us to identify the main reactions responsible for the formation of water and of the oxide network. The morphology of the most interesting ZrO2 samples was further investigated by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).

         <title>Iron Coordination Properties of Gramibactin as Model for the New Class of Diazeniumdiolate Based Siderophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2724-2733, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequestration properties of gramibactin as a prototype for the new class of diazeniumdiolate siderophores is presented and compared with siderophores derived from catecholates and hydroxamates. According to pFe and pL0.5 values, gramibactin is a considerably more potent sequestering agent than the known class of phytosiderophores and approximately reaches the ability of typical hydroxamates like desferrioxamines.







Abstract
Gramibactin (GBT) is an archetype for the new class of diazeniumdiolate siderophores, produced by Paraburkholderia graminis, a cereal&#8208;associated rhizosphere bacterium, for which a detailed solution thermodynamic study exploring the iron coordination properties is reported. The acid&#8208;base behavior of gramibactin as well as its complexing ability toward Fe3+ was studied over a wide range of pH values (2&#8804;pH&#8804;11). For the latter the ligand&#8208;competition method employing EDTA was used. Only two species are formed: [Fe(GBT)]&#8722; (pH&#8197;2 to 9) and [Fe(GBT)(OH)2]3&#8722; (pH&#8805;9). The formation of [Fe(GBT)]&#8722; and its occurrence in real systems was confirmed by LC&#8208;HRESIMS analysis of the bacteria culture broth extract. The sequestering ability of gramibactin was also evaluated in terms of the parameters pFe and pL0.5. Gramibactin exhibits a higher sequestering ability toward Fe3+ than EDTA and of the same order of magnitude as hydroxamate&#8208;type microbial siderophores, but smaller than most of the catecholate&#8208;type siderophores and much higher than the most known phytosiderophores.

Predictable outcomes: Control of stereoselectivity during the glycosylation reaction is the main challenge of synthetic chemistry because the reaction can generate both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosides. Recent mechanistic studies that have applied statistical analysis and quantitation for defining stereoselective changes during the reaction process are discussed.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis is one of the practical approaches to access carbohydrate&#8208;based natural products and their derivatives with high quality and in a large quantity. However, stereoselectivity during the glycosylation reaction is the main challenge because the reaction can generate both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosides. The main focus of the present article is the concept of recent mechanistic studies that have applied statistical analysis and quantitation for defining stereoselective changes during the reaction process. Based on experimental evidence, a detailed discussion associated with the mechanism and degree of influence affecting the stereoselective outcome of glycosylation is included.

Imines are prevalent in synthetic laboratories due to their versatile reactivity profiles, providing access to various N&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, this review summarizes well established main group metal&#8208;mediated transformations and recent developments in current topics including C&#8211;F activation, catalysis, sustainable reaction media and flow chemistry.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated transformations of imines have earned a valued place in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. Their versatility allows the simple preparation of various nitrogen containing compounds. This review will outline the early discoveries including metallation, addition/cyclisation and metathesis pathways, followed by the modern&#8208;day use of imines in synthetic methodology. Recent advances in imine C&#8722;F activation protocols are discussed, alongside revisiting &#8220;classic&#8221; imine reactivity from a sustainable perspective. Developments in catalytic methods for hydroelementation of imines have been reviewed, highlighting the importance of s&#8208;block metals in the catalytic arena. Whilst stoichiometric transformations in alternative reaction media such as deep eutectic solvents or water have been summarised. The incorporation of imines into flow chemistry has received recent attention and is summarised within.

         <title>Direct Trifluoromethylation of Alcohols Using a Hypervalent Iodosulfoximine Reagent</title>

Trilfuoromethylethers made easy! An operationally simple method using the new hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent alongside minimal amounts of a zinc catalyst gives access to a variety of different trifluoromethylethers, in under 2&#8197;h for most cases.







Abstract
The direct trifluoromethylation of a variety of aliphatic alcohols using a hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent afforded the corresponding ethers in moderate to good yields (14&#8211;72&#8201;%). Primary, secondary, and even tertiary alcohols, including examples derived from natural products, underwent this transformation in the presence of catalytic amounts of zinc bis(triflimide). Typical reaction conditions involved a neat mixture of 6.0&#8197;equivalents of the alcohol with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of the reagent, with the majority of reactions complete within 2&#8197;h with 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the Lewis acid catalyst. Furthermore, experimental evidence was provided that the C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming process occurred via the coordination of the alcohol to the iodine atom and subsequent reductive elimination.

         <title>Excitation Energy Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Mediated Quartet State Formation in Porphyrin&#8208;Trityl Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2683-2691, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems composed of a porphyrin chromophore and a trityl radical are investigated with respect to their optical and magnetic properties. Profiting from the time&#8208;resolution of fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and the capability of EPR to distinguish near&#8208;degenerate states with different spin multiplicity, this work reports unique insight into the excited&#8208;state reaction mechanism and suggests improvements to the molecular design in view of applications in the fields of molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for a range of technological applications in various fields, including molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis. However, the further development of these applications, via targeted design of materials with specific magnetic properties, currently still suffers from a lack of understanding of the factors influencing the underlying excited state dynamics and mechanisms on a molecular level. In particular, systematic studies, making use of different techniques to obtain complementary information, are largely missing. This work investigates the photophysics and magnetic properties of a series of three covalently&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;trityl compounds, bridged by a phenyl spacer. By combining the results from femtosecond transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, we determine the efficiencies of the competing excited state reaction pathways and characterise the magnetic properties of the individual spin states, formed by the interaction between the chromophore triplet and the stable radical. The differences observed for the three investigated compounds are rationalised in the context of available theoretical models and the implications of the results of this study for the design of a molecular system with an improved intersystem crossing efficiency are discussed.

         <title>CompassR Yields Highly Organic&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Tolerant Enzymes through Recombination of Compatible Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2789-2797, February 5, 2021. </description>

Smarter variation: Two recombination strategies, the two&#8208;gene recombination process (2GenReP) and the in silico guided recombination process (InSiReP), employing the CompassR (computer&#8208;assisted recombination) rule are used as guides to obtain highly improved variants from huge protein sequence space.







Abstract
The CompassR (computer&#8208;assisted recombination) rule enables, among beneficial substitutions, the identification of those that can be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from Bacillus subtilis lipase&#8197;A (BSLA), which improves resistance to the organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX), were studied to compare two recombination strategies, the two&#8208;gene recombination process (2GenReP) and the in silico guided recombination process (InSiReP), employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX&#8208;resistant variant, M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K), with up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of about 270 clones. M4 has a remarkably enhanced resistance in 60&#8201;% (v/v) acetone (6.0&#8208;fold), 30&#8201;% (v/v) ethanol (2.1&#8208;fold), and 60&#8201;% (v/v) methanol (2.4&#8208;fold) compared with wild&#8208;type BSLA. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that attracting water molecules by charged surface substitutions is the main driver for increasing the DOX resistance of BSLA M4. Both strategies and obtained molecular knowledge can likely be used to improve the properties of other enzymes with a similar &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold.

The dynamic equilibria of organomagnesium reagents are known to be very complex, and the relative reactivity of their components is poorly understood. Herein, a combination of DFT calculations and kinetic experiments is employed to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism of the Pummerer coupling between sulfoxides and turbo&#8208;organomagnesium amides.

Herein, a combination of DFT calculations and kinetic experiments is employed to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism of the Pummerer coupling between sulfoxides and turbo&#8208;organomagnesium amides. Among the various aggregates studied, unprecedented heterometallic open cubane structures are demonstrated to yield favorable barriers through a concerted anion&#8208;anion coupling/ S&#8722;O cleavage step. Beyond a structural curiosity, these results introduce open cubane organometallics as key reactive intermediates in turbo&#8208;organomagnesium amide mixtures.

         <title>Low&#8208;Flammable Parahydrogen&#8208;Polarized MRI Contrast Agents</title>

To design low&#8208;flammable NMR/MRI inhalable contrast agents with the parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization technique, results were derived from kinetic, polarization, and relaxation measurements for a number of functionalized hydrocarbons with various degrees of fluorine substitution.







Abstract
Many MRI contrast agents formed with the parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) technique exhibit biocompatible profiles. In the context of respiratory imaging with inhalable molecular contrast agents, the development of nonflammable contrast agents would nonetheless be highly beneficial for the biomedical translation of this sensitive, high&#8208;throughput and affordable hyperpolarization technique. To this end, we assess the hydrogenation kinetics, the polarization levels and the lifetimes of PHIP hyperpolarized products (acids, ethers and esters) at various degrees of fluorine substitution. The results highlight important trends as a function of molecular structure that are instrumental for the design of new, safe contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications of the PHIP technique, with an emphasis on the highly volatile group of ethers used as inhalable anesthetics.

         <title>Evaluation of the DNA Alkylation Properties of a Chlorambucil&#8208;Conjugated Cyclic Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide</title>

Targeted alkylation: The DNA alkylation properties of a cyclic pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamide that was conjugated with the DNA&#8208;alkylator chlorambucil are reported. The conjugate shows good alkylation ability in vitro and anticancer effects against cancer cells.







Abstract
Hairpin pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamides (hPIPs) and their chlorambucil (Chb) conjugates (hPIP&#8208;Chbs) can alkylate DNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner, and have been studied as anticancer drugs. Here, we conjugated Chb to a cyclic PIP (cPIP), which is known to have a higher binding affinity than the corresponding hPIP, and investigated the DNA alkylation properties of the resulting cPIP&#8208;Chb using the optimized capillary electrophoresis method and conventional HPLC product analysis. cPIP&#8208;Chb conjugate&#8197;3 showed higher alkylation activity at its binding sites than did hPIP&#8208;Chb conjugates&#8197;1 and 2. Subsequent HPLC analysis revealed that the alkylation site of conjugate&#8197;3, which was identified by capillary electrophoresis, was reliable and that conjugate&#8197;3 alkylates the N3 position of adenine as do hPIP&#8208;Chbs. Moreover, conjugate&#8197;3 showed higher cytotoxicity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells than did conjugate&#8197;1 and cytotoxicity comparable to that of conjugate&#8197;2. These results suggest that cPIP&#8208;Chbs could be novel DNA alkylating anticancer drugs.

         <title>Synergetic Effect of Mo6 Clusters and Gold Nanoparticles on the Photophysical Properties of Both Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2818-2825, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
PDT and PTT: Hybrid materials containing Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Mo6 clusters as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents, respectively, in a silica core&#8211;shell system show significant enhancement of the photophysical properties of both components: brighter phosphorescence, higher efficiency of singlet&#8208;oxygen generation, and more pronounced surface plasmon resonance (SPR).







Abstract
Photodynamic and photothermal therapies (PDT, and PTT, respectively) are promising candidates for multimodal anticancer therapies (i.e., combinations of therapies), since their action is based on mechanisms that generally cannot be resisted by cancer cells, that is, generation of highly oxidizing oxygen species and high temperature, respectively. Herein, hybrid materials that combine octahedral molybdenum clusters as potential PDT agents and plasmonic spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as PTT agents are reported. Partial overlap of the photoemission spectrum of the cluster and the surface plasmon resonance band of the AuNPs facilitates energy transfer between the photoactive components, which resulted in synergetic enhancement of their photophysical properties. Specifically, by careful selection of the spacing between the cluster and the gold nanoparticle, a significant increase in luminescence and photosensitizing properties of the cluster was achieved in comparison with similar, but gold&#8208;free, particles. On the other hand, the cluster complex facilitated energy conversion to heat by gold particles and hence increased the heating rate under laser irradiation.

Hierarchical yolk&#8208;shell SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres were prepared via a facile sol&#8208;gel method combined with carbon coating.

Abstract
This work reports the preparation of unique hierarchical yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids by a facile sol&#8208;gel method combined with carbon coating. In the preparation process, SiOx nanosphere is used as a hard template. Etch time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. With the increase in etch time, the yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C with 15 and 30&#8197;nm voids and the TiO2@C hollow nanospheres are obtained. The yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres exhibit remarkable lithium&#8208;ion battery performance as anodes, including high lithium storage capacity, outstanding rate capability, good reversibility, and stable long&#8208;term cycle life. The unique structure can accommodate the large volume change of the SiOx yolk, provide a unique buffering space for the discharge/charge processes, improve the structural stability of the electrode material during repeated Li+ intercalation/deintercalation processes, and enhance the cycling stability. The SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void space exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of &#8776;1195.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles and &#8776;701.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for over 800 cycles. These results suggest that the proposed particle architecture is promising and may have potential applications in improving various high performance anode materials.

Building single&#8208;molecule magnets: A compressed octahedral dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet with local D4h symmetry exhibits an energy barrier over 2000&#8197;K.







Abstract
Three six&#8208;coordinate DyIII single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) [Dy(OtBu)2(L)4]+ with local D4h symmetry are obtained by optimizing the equatorial ligands. One of the compounds with L=4&#8208;phenylpyridine shows an energy barrier (Ueff) of 2075(11)&#8197;K, which is the third largest Ueff, and the first Ueff&gt;2000&#8197;K for SMMs with axial&#8208;type symmetry so far. Ab initio analysis indicates that the exceptional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is deeply related to the axially compressed octahedral geometry. This work provides a new insight into the local D4h symmetry for high&#8208;performance SMMs.

         <title>Easy Access to Enantiomerically Pure Heterocyclic Silicon&#8208;Chiral Phosphonium Cations and the Matched/Mismatched Case of Dihydrogen Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2649-2653, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silyl phosphonium ions are a synthetically valuable class of compounds from a stereochemical and preparative point of view. Convenient routes towards small and configurationally stable, silicon&#8208;chiral four&#8208;membered heterocyclic cations are disclosed (see scheme). By combining experimental, spectroscopic, stereochemical, and computational methods, a matched/mismatched case was identified for both dehydrogenation and protodesilylation and the intermolecularity of these reactions proven.







Abstract
Phosphonium ions are widely used in preparative organic synthesis and catalysis. The provision of new types of cations that contain both functional and chiral information is a major synthetic challenge and can open up new horizons in asymmetric cation&#8208;directed and Lewis acid catalysis. We discovered an efficient methodology towards new Si&#8208;chiral four&#8208;membered CPSSi* heterocyclic cations. Three synthetic approaches are presented. The stereochemical sequence of anchimerically assisted cation formation with B(C6F5)3 and subsequent hydride addition was fully elucidated and proceeds with excellent preservation of the chiral information at the stereogenic silicon atom. Also the mechanism of dihydrogen release from a protonated hydrosilane was studied in detail by the help of Si&#8208;centered chirality as stereochemical probe. Chemoselectivity switch (dihydrogen release vs. protodesilylation) can easily be achieved through slight modifications of the solvent. A matched/mismatched case was identified and the intermolecularity of this reaction supported by spectroscopic, kinetic, deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Azolium/Hydroquinone Organo&#8208;Radical Co&#8208;Catalysis: Aerobic C&#8722;C&#8208;Bond Cleavage in Ketones</title>

Combine and conquer: A new method for the generation of radical species that does not require photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates is reported. The combined use of an azolium salt and hydroquinone generated an efficient catalytic system for the aerobic C&#8722;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted ketones. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.







Abstract
Organo&#8208;radical catalysts have recently attracted great interest, and the development of this field can be expected to broaden the applications of organocatalysis. Herein, the first example of a radical&#8208;generating system is reported that does not require any photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates. The oxidative C&#8722;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones was achieved using an azolium salt and a hydroquinone as co&#8208;catalysts. A catalytic mechanism was proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.

Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids were successfully prepared, and the regulation of SiOx yolk was achieved by changing the etching time. The etching time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. The dial represents the etching time of SiOx yolk in NaOH solution and the brightness of the Chinese red lantern represents the electrochemical performance of the composites. When the etching time is 60&#8197;min, SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void exhibits remarkable performance as an anode for lithium&#8211;ion batteries.

         <title>A Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized in a Deep Eutectic Solvent for Dye Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2692-2698, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste not: A deep eutectic solvent has been used as a green solvent for the first time to synthesize a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework, TpPa&#8208;COOH, under environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH exhibited good crystallinity, with ordered, open channels. Significantly, its high adsorption capacity could be used to remove cationic organic dyes from wastewater.







Abstract
Instead of using organic solvents, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of tetrabutylammonium bromide and imidazole (Bu4NBr/Im) was employed as a solvent for the first time to synthesize covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Due to the low vapor pressure of the Bu4NBr/Im&#8208;based DES, a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized COF (TpPa&#8208;COOH) was synthesized under environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH has open channels, and the DES can be removed completely from the pores. The dye adsorption performance of TpPa&#8208;COOH was examined for three organic dyes with similar molecular sizes: one anionic dye (eosin&#8197;B, EB) and two cationic dyes (methylene blue, MB and safranine&#8197;T, ST). TpPa&#8208;COOH showed an excellent selective adsorption effect on MB and ST. The electronegative keto form in TpPa&#8208;COOH might help to form electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the &#960;&#8208;stacking frameworks of TpPa&#8208;COOH and the positive plane MB and ST molecules. The adsorption isotherms of MB and ST on TpPa&#8208;COOH were further investigated in detail, and the equilibrium adsorption was well modeled by using a Langmuir isotherm model. Together with hydrogen bonding, TpPa&#8208;COOH showed higher adsorption capacity for ST than for MB (1135 vs. 410&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). These results could provide a guidance for the green synthesis of adsorbents in removing organic dyes from wastewater.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Terminated Tin Sulfide Clusters: Optical Properties and Deposition on a Metal Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2734-2741, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first series of pyrene&#8208;terminated organotin sulfide compounds and unprecedented side products, [(RpyrCl2Sn)2S] (1), (pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (2), 1,2&#8208;bis(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (3), [(RpyrSn)4S6]&#8901;2&#8201;CH2Cl2 (4), and [(RpyrSn)4Sn2S10] (5), were synthesized. The combination of inorganic Sn/S moieties with the pyrene units affects optical absorption and fluorescence properties as well as the deposition on a metal surface.







Abstract
Herein, we present the synthesis of two pyrene&#8208;functionalized clusters, [(RpyrSn)4S6]&#8901;2&#8201;CH2Cl2 (4) and [(RpyrSn)4Sn2S10]&#8901;n&#8201;CH2Cl2 (n=4, 5&#8201;a; n=2, 5&#8201;b; Rpyr=CMe2CH2C(Me)N&#8208;NC(H)C16H9), both of which form in reactions of the organotin sulfide cluster [(RNSn)4S6] (C; RN=CMe2CH2C(Me)N&#8208;NH2) with the well&#8208;known fluorescent dye 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxaldehyde (B). In contrast, reactions using an organotin sulfide cluster with another core structure, [(RNSn)3S4Cl] (A), leads to formation of small molecular fragments, [(RpyrCl2Sn)2S] (1), (pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (2), and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (3). Besides synthesis and structures of the new compounds, we report the influence of the inorganic core on the optical properties of the dye, which was analyzed exemplarily for compound&#8197;5&#8201;a via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. This cluster was also used for exploring the potential of such non&#8208;volatile clusters for deposition on a metal surface under vacuum conditions.

         <title>Breslow Intermediates (Amino Enols) and Their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>

Breslow intermediates in the gas phase: In N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed Umpolung, the reaction of the substrate aldehyde with the NHC gives the Breslow intermediate (BI) as pivotal species. The combination of IR ion spectroscopy with quantum chemical computations can determine whether the BI exists as a nucleophilic amino enol or as its keto tautomer in the gas phase, which is decisive for its reactivity both in enzymatic catalysis and in organocatalysis.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol or in the form of its electrophilic keto tautomer is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. Herein, the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes is reported. An ammonium charge tag is introduced through the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR ion spectroscopy allowed the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8211;enol equilibria.

         <title>CoPd Nanoalloys with Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as Template for Both N&#8208;Doped Carbon and Cobalt Precursor: Efficient and Robust Catalysts for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>

Glassy kobold: CoPd nanoalloys are prepared using a metal&#8211;organic framework as a template for both, the N&#8208;doped carbon and cobalt precursors. The catalyst encapsulated in silica shell represents a clean, mild and efficient system for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes and alkenes. Improved activity is achieved due to the synergistic effect between Co and Pd components whereas the improved stability is owed to the protection of the silica shell.







Abstract
In this work, a series of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived CoPd nanoalloys have been prepared. The nanocatalysts exhibited excellent activities in the hydrogenation of nitroarenes and alkenes in green solvent (ethanol/water) under mild conditions (H2 balloon, room temperature). Using ZIF&#8208;67 as template for both carbon matrix and cobalt precursor coating with a mesoporous SiO2 layer, the catalyst CoPd/NC@SiO2 was smoothly constructed. Catalytic results revealed a synergistic effect between Co and Pd components in the hydrogenation process due to the enhanced electron density. The mesoporous SiO2 shell effectively prevented the sintering of hollow carbon and metal NPs at high temperature, furnishing the well&#8208;dispersed nanoalloy catalysts and better catalytic performance. Moreover, the catalyst was durable and showed negligible activity decay in recycling and scale&#8208;up experiments, providing a mild and highly efficient way to access amines and arenes.

         <title>Twofold C&#8722;H Activation Enables Synthesis of a Diazacoronene&#8208;Type Fluorophore with Near Infrared Emission Through Isosteric Replacement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2753-2759, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twofold C&#8722;H activation of diazaperylene by a rhodium catalyst produces a bis(amide)&#8208;embedded coronene, which retains high aromaticity and exhibits an intense near infrared fluorescence with a high quantum yield. Thus, the replacement of C=C double bonds with amides represents a useful strategy for emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Further complexation with B(C6F5)3 enhances the aromaticity of the amide&#8208;embedded hexagon rings.







Abstract
The synthesis and photophysical properties of a soluble amide&#8208;embedded coronene is reported. The key step in this synthesis is the twofold C&#8722;H activation of diazaperylene by a rhodium(III)Cp* catalyst. This unprecedented structural motif shows intense fluorescence in the near infrared region with a small Stokes shift and a distinct vibronic structure, which exhibits a slight extent of negative solvatochromism. Comparison of this compound with some relevant compounds revealed the importance of the amide incorporation in the peripheral concave region including an angular position to retain high aromaticity reflecting that of parent coronene. Treatment of this compound with Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 formed a bis&#8208;adduct, which exhibited enhanced aromaticity as a consequence of the increased double bond character of the amide C&#8722;N bonds.

         <title>A Domino Fusion of an Organic Ligand Depended on Metal&#8208;Induced and Oxygen Insertion, Unraveled by Crystallography, Mass Spectrometry, and DFT Calculations</title>

Dominoes under investigation: Tandem application of crystallography and mass spectrometry unraveled a competitive in situ domino solvothermal reaction to tetrabenzimidazol&#8208;pyrazine within [Co2(3)Cl4] in seven steps and to a deprotonated imide anion L2&#8242;&#8242; within 1D chain ([Co1.5(L2&#8242;&#8242;)]n) in six steps.







Abstract
Herein, the reaction of (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanamine (L1) with Co(H2O)6Cl2, in CH3CN at 120&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine (3), isolated as a dimeric cluster {[CoII2(3)Cl4]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3CN} (2), is reported. When O2 and H2O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (HL1&#8242;) is first formed and crystallized as [CoIII(L1)2(L1&#8242;)]Cl2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (4) before fusion of HL1&#8242; with L1, giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (HL2&#8242;&#8242;) forming a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [CoII3(L2&#8242;&#8242;)2Cl4]n (5). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to 2, but six steps for 5, for which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in 5 originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared with FeCl3&#8901;6&#8201;H2O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules, which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.

Switchable TADF: New phenothiazine and quinoline derivatives exhibit outstanding phase&#8208;dependent reversibility between ON/OFF states (low and high emission intensity, drastic shifting of emission colors, short&#8208; and long&#8208;lived fluorescence) in systematic grinding/fuming cycles, required for multichannel memory devices based on optical information multicoding. TADF: thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Three new quinoline and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenothiazine isomeric derivatives were synthesized and characterized towards applications for oxygen sensing and optical information multicoding. The compounds with phenylene linker showed outstanding phase&#8208;dependent reversibility between ON/OFF states (low and high emission intensity, drastic shifting of emission colors, short&#8208; and long&#8208;lived fluorescence) in systematic grinding/fuming cycles, as required for multichannel memory devices based on optical information multicoding. The conformational diversity of the phenothiazine unit resulted in dual emission of the doped films implemented by the different luminescence mechanisms with peaks located at 414/530, 416/540, and 440/582&#8197;nm. The presence of a phenylene linker and thus two rotational degrees of freedom resulted in quenching of the delayed fluorescence of quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers in the solid state. The compound containing no phenylene bridge was characterized by two different driving photoluminescence mechanisms of the doped films: short fluorescence of the quasi&#8208;axial conformer and thermally activated delayed fluorescence of the quasi&#8208;equatorial form. This compound showed oxygen sensitivity with a Stern&#8211;Volmer constant of 7.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;ppm&#8722;1.

         <title>A Fast and General Route to Ketones from Amides and Organolithium Compounds under Aerobic Conditions: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>

SNAc with organolithiums under air: Aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic ketones are quickly (20&#8197;s reaction time) obtained in up to 93&#8201;% yield in a straightforward and chemoselective manner and with a broad substrate scope by reacting organolithium reagents with a variety of amides at ambient temperature under air in the environmentally friendly cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME). Gram&#8208;scale preparations and recyclability of the reagents are also successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20&#8197;s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93&#8201;% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.

         <title>A Simple Route to the Synthesis of Pt Nanobars and the Mechanistic Understanding of Symmetry Reduction</title>

Pt nanobars: A facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 is reported by simply reducing a PtIV precursor in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). Our mechanistic study indicates that the anisotropic growth results from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here, a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 was reported by simply reducing a PtIV precursor in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of PtIV precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant. Our mechanistic study indicated that the anisotropic growth resulted from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.

Paved with gold: We describe a multiple C&#8722;H functionalization reaction of carbazole heterocycles with diazoalkanes. We show that gold catalysts play a distinct role in enabling a multiple C&#8722;H functionalization reaction to introduce up to six carbene fragments onto molecules containing multiple carbazole units or to link multiple carbazole units into a single molecule. A one&#8208;pot stepwise approach enables the introduction of two different carbene fragments to allow orthogonal deprotection and straightforward derivatization.

The stereoselectivity and yield of glycosylation reactions are influenced by numerous intrinsic and environmental factors. Their optimization is therefore challenging and time&#8208;consuming. Computer&#8208;aided synthesis has provided an attractive approach to predict the performance of the reactions. This Concept article by C.&#8208;C. Wang and colleagues on page 2556 introduces the recent achievements on the statistical analysis to glycosylation reactions. The numerous variables that have been systematically dissected with new guidelines and novel strategies in stereoselective glycosylations are outlined.

         <title>The Aggregation Pattern of A&#946;1&#8211;40 is Altered by the Presence of N&#8208;Truncated A&#946;4&#8211;40 and/or CuII in a Similar Way through Ionic Interactions</title>

Converging mechanisms: The similar effect of A&#946;4&#8211;40 and substoichiometric CuII on the kinetic parameters of A&#946;1&#8211;40 aggregation and fibril morphology correlates with the increased positive charge at the A&#946; N terminus induced by CuII complexation or N truncation at position 4, thus providing a unifying mechanistic concept for the biological aggregation of coexisting A&#946; species (see figure).







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common of the multifactorial diseases and is characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes, such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. In this study, we have investigated the effect of CuII on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8211;40 and A&#946;4&#8211;40, representing the two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, that is, the full length and N&#8208;truncated peptides. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. For either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric CuII concentrations accelerated aggregation, whereas superstoichiometric CuII inhibited fibril formation, likely by stabilizing the oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8211;40 or substoichiometric CuII affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8211;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils; amorphous aggregates were formed in the presence of a molar excess of CuII. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase in the positive charge on the A&#946; N terminus, caused both by CuII complexation and N truncation at position 4. Our findings provide a better understanding of the biological A&#946; aggregation process as these two A&#946; species and CuII coexist and interact under physiological conditions.

NIR dyes: Simple and readily synthesizable BF2 complexes of tert&#8208;amine&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;cyanoformazans are shown to absorb and emit light at wavelengths that are unusually long for such small molecules (&#955;abs=691&#8211;760&#8197;nm, &#955;PL=834&#8211;904&#8197;nm in toluene). Detailed investigations of several such complexes reveal that strong charge transfer is not a prerequisite for their near&#8208;infrared activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are sought after for their utility in light harvesting, bioimaging, and light&#8208;mediated therapies. Since long&#8208;wavelength photoluminescence typically involves extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of double bonds and aromatic rings, it is often assumed that NIR dyes have to be large molecules that require complex syntheses. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that facile incorporation of tertiary amine groups into readily available 3&#8208;cyanoformazans affords efficient production of relatively simple NIR&#8208;active BF2 formazanate dyes (&#955;abs=691&#8211;760&#8197;nm, &#955;PL=834&#8211;904&#8197;nm in toluene). Cyclic voltammetry experiments on these compounds reveal multiple reversible redox waves linked to the interplay between the tertiary amine and BF2 formazanate moieties. Density&#8208;functional calculations indicate that the NIR electronic transitions in BF2 formazanates are of &#960;&#8594;&#960;*&#8208;type, but do not always involve strong charge transfer.

Isomers of nitrenium cations [C6H4N2(tBu)C(C12H8)][BF4], 1 and 2, react with carbenes and phosphines and phosphide. Small donors form N&#8208;bound Lewis adducts. Larger donors attack at the aryl carbon para&#8208;to N, where phosphines induces proton migration ring opening the N2C3 ring, while carbene prompt loss of H. affording radical cation salts. Reactions of 1 and 2 with KPPh2 effects electron transfer affording (PPh2)2 and persistent radical products.







Abstract
Alkylation of spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,3&#8217;&#8208;indazole] at N(1) and N(2) with tBuCl affords the nitrenium cations [C6H4N2(tBu)C(C12H8)][BF4], 1 and 2, respectively. Compound&#8197;1 converts to 2 over the temperature range 303&#8211;323&#8197;K with a free energy barrier of 28&#177;5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Reaction of 1 with PMe3 afforded the N&#8208;bound phosphine adduct [C6H4N(tBu)N(PMe3)C(C12H8)]BF4] 3. However, phosphines attack 2 at the para&#8208;carbon atom of the aryl group with concurrent cleavage of N(2)&#8722;C(1) bond and proton migration to C(1) affording [(R3P)C6H3NN(tBu)CH(C12H8)][BF4] (R=Me 4, nBu 5). Analogous reactions of 1 and 2 with the carbene SIMes prompt attack at the para&#8208;carbon with concurrent loss of H. affording the radical cation salts [(SIMes)C6H3N(tBu)NC(C12H8).][BF4] 6 and [(SIMes)C6H3NN(tBu)C(C12H8).][BF4] 7, whereas reaction of 2 with BAC gives the Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct, [C6H4N(BAC)N(tBu)C(C12H8)][BF4] 8. Finally, reactions of 1 and 2 with KPPh2 result in electron transfer affording (PPh2)2 and the persistent radicals C6H4N(tBu)NC(C12H8). and C6H4NN(tBu)C(C12H8).. The detailed reaction mechanisms are also explored by extensive DFT calculations.

Reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; afforded the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;bound phosphine adduct [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)N(PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)C(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. However, phosphines attack &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; at the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carbon atom of the aryl group with concurrent cleavage of N(2)&#8722;C(1) bond and proton migration to C(1) affording [(R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NN(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)CH(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (R=Me &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). Analogous reactions of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with the carbene SIMes prompt attack at the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;carbon with concurrent loss of H&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; affording the radical cation salts [(SIMes)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)NC(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and [(SIMes)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NN(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)C(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, whereas reaction of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with BAC gives the Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct, [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(BAC)N(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)C(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;. Finally, reactions of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with KPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; result in electron transfer affording (PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the persistent radicals C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)NC(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NN(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)C(C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;. The detailed reaction mechanisms are also explored by extensive DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

Breslow Intermediates are of pivotal importance for chemical and biological Umpolung reactions catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). In the sense of John&#8197;B. Fenn (NP 2002), attachment of a charge tag to these &#8220;molecular elephants&#8221; provides them with &#8220;electrospray wings&#8221;, and for the first time allows their gase phase structural characterization by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. The enol&#8208;ketone tautomerism of a number of NHC&#8208;aldehyde combinations, crucial for their chemical reactivity, have been determined in the gas&#8208;phase and interpreted by DFT calculations.

Multi&#8208;functional pyrene&#8208;viologens: The synthesis, molecular and electronic structures, photophysical, electrochemical, and spectroelectrochemical properties of 2&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;substituted para&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium pyrene compounds are described along with detailed theoretical calculations. These compounds show strong interactions with calf thymus (ct)&#8208;DNA, presumably by intercalation.







Abstract
Two N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds and analogous N&#8208;protonated salts of 2&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyrene compounds were synthesised and their crystal structures, photophysical properties both in solution and in the solid state, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties were studied. Upon methylation or protonation, the emission maxima are significantly bathochromically shifted compared to the neutral compounds, although the absorption maxima remain almost unchanged. As a result, the cationic compounds show very large apparent Stokes shifts of up to 7200&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds have a single reduction at ca. &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ in MeCN. While the reduction process was reversible for the 2,7&#8208;disubstituted compound, it was irreversible for the mono&#8208;substituted one. Experimental findings are complemented by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Furthermore, the N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds show strong interactions with calf thymus (ct)&#8208;DNA, presumably by intercalation, which paves the way for further applications of these multi&#8208;functional compounds as potential DNA&#8208;bioactive agents.

         <title>Flexible yet Robust Framework of Tin(II) Oxide Carbodiimide for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>

Linked by MOFs: Sn2O(CN2) with loosely packed crystal structure possesses a metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;like porous framework, which mitigates volume expansion and Sn atom aggregation. Sn2O(CN2) shows a significantly enhanced lithium storage performance compared to traditional tin oxide.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can become promising electrode materials for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because their loosely packed porous structures may mitigate volume expansion and metal atom aggregation, which occur at the respective metal oxides. However, they suffer from poor electrical conductivity and irreversible structural degradation upon charge/discharge processes, which impede their practical utilization. Herein, we investigate MOF&#8208;like Sn2O(CN2) as a new electrode material. The conductive yet flexible [N=C=N] linkers are tilted between [Sn4O] nodes and cross&#8208;linked into a porous quasi&#8208;layered structure. Such structure offers abundant channels for fast Li&#8208;ion transport and tolerance of enormous volume expansion. Notably, anisotropic [N=C=N]2&#8722; arrays hardly migrate so that Sn0 nanodots are physically separated via robust [N=C=N]2&#8722; framework during discharge, thereby effectively preventing the formation of large Sn islands. Owing to the structural advantage, the Sn2O(CN2) electrode exhibits an initial Coulombic efficiency as high as &#8764;80&#8201;%. With the addition of graphite as conductive supporter, the electrode provides 978&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after 300&#8197;cycles. Such MOF&#8208;like carbodiimides hold potential for the advanced electrodes in LIBs and other battery systems.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling between o&#8208;Carboranes and Twisted Amides: A Regioselective, Additive&#8208;Free, and Concise Late&#8208;Stage Carboranylation</title>

Rh catalysis was used to enable cross&#8208;coupling between o&#8208;carborane and twisted amide. A series of regioselective B(3,6)&#8722;C, B(3,5)&#8722;Ar and B(4)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling products have been obtained. The operationally simple reaction gives rise to diverse carboranyl&#8208;fused organic motifs and accommodates late&#8208;stage diversification, which may pave a new way for medicinal investigations.







Abstract
The convenient cross&#8208;coupling of sp2 or sp3 carbons with a specific boron vertex on carborane cage represents significant synthetic values and insurmountable challenges. In this work, we report an Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction between o&#8208;carborane and N&#8208;acyl&#8208;glutarimides to construct various Bcage&#8722;C bonds. Under the optimized condition, the removable imine directing group (DG) leads to B(3)&#8722; or B(3,6)&#8722;C couplings, while the pyridyl DG leads to B(3,5)&#8722;Ar coupling. In particular, an unexpected rearrangement of amide reagent is observed in pyridyl directed B(4)&#8722;C(sp3) formation. This scalable protocol has many advantages, including easy access, the use of cheap and widely available coupling agents, no requirement of an external ligand, base or oxidant, high efficiency, and a broad substrate scope. Leveraging the RhI dimer and twisted amides, this method enables straightforward access to diversely substituted and therapeutically important carborane derivatives at boron site, and provides a highly valuable vista for carborane&#8208;based drug screening.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Carbazole Derivatives as Host Materials for Highly Efficient and Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended host: Expansion of the &#960; conjugation of a carbazole derivative by benzothiophene units enhances its performance as a host in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. The &#960;&#8208;extended host material exhibits lower efficiency roll&#8208;off and longer operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance (LT50) of approximately 23&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 compared with conventional host materials.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100&#8201;% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;bis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)biphenyl (mCBP) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, the &#960; conjugation of the carbazole unit was expanded to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely m1BTCBP and m4BTCBP. Among these host materials, m1BTCBP formed a highly efficient [Ir(ppy)3]&#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT50) of over 300&#8197;h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (current density: 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The LT50 value at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was estimated to be about 23&#8201;000&#8197;h. This performance is clearly higher than that of mCBP&#8208;based OLEDs (LT50&#8776;8500&#8197;h).

         <title>3D&#8208;Non&#8208;destructive Imaging through Heavy&#8208;Metal Eosin Salt Contrast Agents</title>

Add some color: The dibromo fluorescein barium salt proves to be a suitable staining agent enabling the diagnostic screening of tissue samples by X&#8208;ray microscopic computed tomography without impending further diagnostics through histological methods.







Abstract
Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging (CT) to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement. The dibromo fluorescein barium salt turned out to be the ideal X&#8208;ray contrast agent, allowing for 3D imaging and subsequent complementing counterstaining applying standard histological techniques.

         <title>Aromatic Metamorphosis of Thiophenes by Means of Desulfurative Dilithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desulfurative dilithiation of thiophenes and benzo&#8208;fused derivatives using lithium metal has been developed for the efficient generation of multi&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dilithium compounds. The resulting dianions are key intermediates for the synthesis of diverse heteroles. This protocol also enables the desulfurative construction of aromatic rings from thiophene derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
A new mode of aromatic metamorphosis has been developed, which allows thiophenes and their benzo&#8208;fused derivatives to be converted to a variety of exotic heteroles. This transformation involves 1)&#8197;the efficient generation of key 1,4&#8208;dianions by means of desulfurative dilithiation with lithium powder and 2)&#8197;the subsequent trapping of the dianions with heteroatom electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot manner. Via the desulfurative dilithiation, the sulfur atoms of thiophenes are replaced also with a carbon&#8211;carbon double bond or a 1,2&#8208;phenylene for the construction of benzene rings.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes Bearing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Pillar[5]arene Rings**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping in shape: Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based polyrotaxanes were produced from pillar[5]arene as ring components by precipitation in water/methanol and a subsequent capping reaction. Multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important for the preparation and also provided a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyrotaxane with heat&#8208;induced elasticity and shape memory properties without additional crosslinking.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) are useful polymers with good water solubility, biological compatibility, and commercial availability. PEOs with various end groups were threaded into pillar[5]arene rings in a mixture of water and methanol to afford pseudopolyrotaxanes. Corresponding polyrotaxanes were also constructed by capping COOH&#8208;terminated pseudopolyrotaxanes with bulky amines, in which multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important to prevent dethreading. The number of threaded ring components could be rationally controlled in these materials, providing a simple and versatile method to tune the mechanical and thermal properties. Specifically, a polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle became elastic upon heating above the melting point of PEOs and exhibited temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory property because of the topological confinement and crosslinked hydrogen bonds.

The number of threaded ring components could be rationally controlled in these materials, providing a simple and versatile method to tune the mechanical and thermal properties. Specifically, a polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle became elastic upon heating above the melting point of PEOs and exhibited temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory property because of the topological confinement and crosslinked hydrogen bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi&#8208;Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near&#8208;IR probe to unveil a rapid excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer&#8594;charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Sorption Using Compartmentalized Coordination Polymers with Discrete Voids**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a trap! The use of a metal&#8208;organic material with discrete voids serves to efficiently trap CO2 from different gas mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments show an excellent selectivity and regenerability in mixtures with CH4 and N2.







Abstract
Carbon capture and storage with porous materials is one of the most promising technologies to minimize CO2 release into the atmosphere. Here, we report a family of compartmentalized coordination polymers (CCPs) capable of capturing gas molecules in a selective manner based on two novel tetrazole&#8208;based ligands. Crystal structures have been modelled theoretically under the Density Functional Theory (DFT) revealing the presence of discrete voids of 380&#8197;&#197;3. Single gas adsorption isotherms of N2, CH4 and CO2 have been measured, obtaining a loading capacity of 0.6, 1.7 and 2.2 molecules/void at 10&#8197;bar and at 298&#8197;K for the best performing material. Moreover, they present excellent selectivity and regenerability for CO2 in mixtures with CH4 and N2 in comparison with other reported materials, as evidenced by dynamic breakthrough gas experiments. These frameworks are therefore great candidates for separation of gas mixtures in the chemical engineering industry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Closing Olefin Metathesis Catalyzed by Well&#8208;Defined Vanadium Alkylidene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined vanadium alkylidene complexes catalyze ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis of various dienes with activity acceptable for routine organic synthesis. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group, as well as the size and &#963;&#8208;donating properties of the phosphine.







Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based catalysts have shown activity and selectivity in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of strained cyclic olefins comparable to those of Ru, Mo, and W catalysts. However, the application of V alkylidenes in routine organic synthesis is limited. Here, we present the first example of ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis catalyzed by well&#8208;defined V chloride alkylidene phosphine complexes. The developed catalysts exhibit tolerance to various functional groups, such as an ether, an ester, a tertiary amide, a tertiary amine, and a sulfonamide. The size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group and the phosphine play a crucial role in the stability of active intermediates. Reactions with ethylene and olefins suggest that both &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of the metallacyclobutene and bimolecular decomposition are responsible for catalyst degradation.

         <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate with Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of different functional groups has led to the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate material, KSb2C2O4F5, to exhibit a birefringent response (&#916;n=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm); this value is larger than that of the commercial &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4, despite its suboptimal anisotropic structure.







Abstract
Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as in laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb2C2O4F5, by a combination of delocalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8722; groups, stereochemical active Sb3+ cations, and the most electronegative element, fluorine. The [C2O4]2&#8722; groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb2C2O4F5; nonetheless, KSb2C2O4F5 exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;n=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm) that is even better than that of the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4, even though the latter features an optimal arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6]3&#8722; groups. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8722; anions, highly distorted SbO2F2 and SbOF3 polyhedra with a stereochemically active lone pair. The combination of lone&#8208;pair electrons and &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems boosts the birefringence to a large extent and will help the development of high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.

         <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Proton&#8208;switchable&#8221; biomimetic metal complex: An oxo&#8208;transfer reaction at the metal center is controlled by protonation of the remote ligand sphere, which modulates electron donor ability of the ligand, promotes oxidant binding, and facilitates access to high&#8208;valent catalytic intermediates.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbones might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. A conceptually parallel process might allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.

&lt;p&gt;High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbones might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. A conceptually parallel process might allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unusually Large Hexameric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large, hexameric cage based on amide dimerization self&#8208;assembles from a designed macrocyclic building block in nonpolar solvents. The unusually large structure (V&#8764;2800&#8197;&#197;3) features openings commonly associated with covalently linked cages and forms host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70). The formation of the hexameric structure was found to be strongly concentration dependent.







Abstract
The sizes of available self&#8208;assembled hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;based supramolecular capsules and cages are rather limited. The largest systems have volumes of approximately 1400&#8211;2300&#8197;&#197;3. Herein, we report a large, hexameric cage based on intermolecular amide&#8211;amide dimerization. The unusual structure with openings, reminiscent of covalently linked cages, is held together by 24 hydrogen bonds. With a diameter of 2.3&#8197;nm and a cavity volume of &#8764;2800&#8197;&#197;3, the assembly is larger than any previously known capsule/cage structure relying exclusively on hydrogen bonds. The self&#8208;assembly process in chlorinated, organic solvents was found to be strongly concentration dependent, with the monomeric form prevailing at low concentrations. Additionally, the formation of host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) was observed.

Multifunctional masks for COVID: Multifunctional materials with unique chemical and physical properties can be fabricated by combining electrospun nanofibers, plasmonic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoclusters, and 3D printed structures. This concept article highlights smart nanomaterials&#8217; key role in developing the next generation of face masks with the highest impact in terms of self&#8208;sanitizing, filtration efficiency, and effective comfort.







Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreak. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and antipathogen properties. Here, how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials is outlined. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility of developing a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically driven and on&#8208;demand antipathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photothermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4).

         <dc:description>Foremost, practical applications of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) materials require control of the nature of the spin&#8208;state coupling. In existing SCO materials, there is a single, well&#8208;defined dimensionality relevant to the switching behavior.

Detailed structural, vibrational, and theoretical studies conclusively confirm that intra&#8208;trimer coupling is an order of magnitude great than the intra&#8208;molecular coupling, which is an order of magnitude greater than inter&#8208;molecular coupling. As such, we have ascertained for the first time a clear hierarchy on the nature of elastic coupling in SCO materials, a necessary step for the technological development of molecular switching materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host&#8208;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N&#8208;rich antennae investigated in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green light emitting NDI is yet to be established. Herein we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric &#8211;NH2 substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8208;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8211;NH2 substituted NDI (2) revealed quantum yield, &#1060;f of ~81% and ~68% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the &#1060;f by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the ESIPT process. Our synthetic protocol applies Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8211;NH2 group integration at NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonds in excited&#8208;state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8197;Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions: NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions are fabricated through an in&#8197;situ corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is investigated systematically for photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endow the NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions with high HER activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue owing to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption, and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, the construction of uniform, controllable, and effective heterojunctions is still a huge challenge. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions are fabricated through an in&#8197;situ corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is investigated systematically in terms of photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endow the NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions with a high HER activity (43.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is about 2.4&#8197;times that of pure Nb3O7F and 1.36&#8197;times that of pure NaNbO3. The results may provide some new insights into the corrosion technique and HER activity of novel heterostructured catalysts.

         <title>Extended Peptide Nucleic Acid Nucleobases Based on Isoorotic Acid for the Recognition of A&#8211;U Base Pairs in Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a bind: Four new A&#8211;U binding nucleobases (Io1&#8211;Io4) are prepared and incorporated into peptide nucleic acids (PNA) for triple helical binding with double&#8208;stranded RNA. Io nucleobases show two times stronger Hoogsteen&#8208;hydrogen bonded triplets with A&#8211;U and similar selectivity compared to commonly used T*A&#8211;U triplets. Notably, strong binding is retained when four sequential Io4 residues are employed.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) with extended isoorotamide containing nucleobases (Io) were designed for binding A&#8211;U base pairs in double&#8208;stranded RNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed improved affinity for A&#8211;U using the Io scaffold in PNA. PNAs having four sequential Io extended nucleobases maintained high binding affinity.

         <title>Tetryl&#8208;Tetrylene Addition to Phenylacetylene</title>

Abstract
Phenylacetylene adds [Ar*GeH2&#8208;SnAr&#8217;], [Ar*GeH2&#8208;PbAr&#8217;] and [Ar'SnH2&#8208;PbAr*] at rt in a regioselective and stereoselective reaction. The highest reactivity was found for the stannylene, which reacts immediately upon addition of one equivalent of alkyne. However, the plumbylenes exhibit addition to the alkyne only in reaction with an excess of phenylacetylene. The product of the germylplumbylene addition reacts with a second equivalent of alkyne and the product of a CH&#8208;activation, a dimeric lead acetylide, were isolated. In the case of the stannylplumbylene the trans&#8208;addition product was characterized as the kinetically controlled product which isomerizes at rt to yield the cis&#8208;addition product, which is stabilized by an intramolecular Sn&#8211;H&#8211;Pb interaction. NMR chemical shifts of the olefins were investigated using two&#8208; and four&#8208;component relativistic DFT calculations, as spin&#8211;orbit effects can be large. Hydride abstraction was carried out by treating [Ar'SnPhC=CHGeH2Ar*] with the trityl salt [Ph3C][Al(OC{CF3})4] to yield a four membered ring cation.

&lt;p&gt;Phenylacetylene adds [Ar*GeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;SnAr&#8217;], [Ar*GeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;PbAr&#8217;] and [Ar'SnH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;PbAr*] at rt in a regioselective and stereoselective reaction. The highest reactivity was found for the stannylene, which reacts immediately upon addition of one equivalent of alkyne. However, the plumbylenes exhibit addition to the alkyne only in reaction with an excess of phenylacetylene. The product of the germylplumbylene addition reacts with a second equivalent of alkyne and the product of a CH&#8208;activation, a dimeric lead acetylide, were isolated. In the case of the stannylplumbylene the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;addition product was characterized as the kinetically controlled product which isomerizes at rt to yield the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;addition product, which is stabilized by an intramolecular Sn&#8211;H&#8211;Pb interaction. NMR chemical shifts of the olefins were investigated using two&#8208; and four&#8208;component relativistic DFT calculations, as spin&#8211;orbit effects can be large. Hydride abstraction was carried out by treating [Ar'SnPhC=CHGeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar*] with the trityl salt [Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C][Al(OC{CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;})&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] to yield a four membered ring cation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure High&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE=Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitridosilicatephosphates are synthesized using high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions. The incorporation of P and Si as well as their occupational disorder in the compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) is proven by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, STEM&#8208;EDX mapping, and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show blue luminescence under irradiation with UV light and therefore expand the range of possible host lattices for luminescent materials.







Abstract
Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides that upon doping with Eu2+ exhibit intriguing luminescence properties, which makes them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability; however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN3 and SiP2N4NH have been described so far. The compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8211;1700&#8201;&#176;C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P3N5 and Si3N4. The latter were activated by NH4F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP3N7 and BaSiP3N7 were obtained as single crystals. They crystallized in the barylite&#8208;1O (M=Sr) and barylite&#8208;2O structure types (M=Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder was further supported by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of BaSiP3N7 with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu2+, both compounds showed blue emission under UV excitation.

         <title>Replacing the Rhamnose&#8208;Xylose Moiety of QS&#8208;21 with Simpler Terminal Disaccharide Units Attenuates Adjuvant Activity in Truncated Saponin Variants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shorter route to vaccine adjuvants: These multidisciplinary studies have provided streamlined access to new terminal disaccharide variants of truncated, QS&#8208;21 inspired saponin vaccine adjuvants through an expeditious synthetic route, and have identified a critical role for the native rhamnose&#8208;xylose moiety in adjuvant activity in connection with saponin conformation.







Abstract
Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations, which improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use. Previous structure&#8211;activity relationship studies have identified simplified saponin variants with truncated carbohydrate chains, but have not focused on the influence of the linear oligosaccharide domain of QS&#8208;21 in adjuvant activity. Herein, an expeditious 15&#8208;step synthesis of new linear trisaccharide variants of simplified QS&#8208;21&#8208;derived adjuvants is reported, in which the complex terminal xylose&#8208;rhamnose moiety has been replaced with commercially available, simpler lactose and cellobiose disaccharides in a &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration. In vivo immunological evaluation of the synthetic saponins showed attenuated antibody responses, highlighting the negative impact of such carbohydrate modifications on adjuvant activity, which could be associated with higher saponin conformational flexibility.

         <title>Chemodivergence between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;coupling reactions, chemoselectivity becomes a concern when two or more (pseudo)halides are present in the substrates. This minireview surveys cases in which divergent chemoselectivity between electrophiles can be achieved under different reaction conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the possible mechanistic origins of selectivity control.







Abstract
Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as emerging fluorinated groups: synthesis under photoredox catalysis and determination of the lipophilicity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico&#8208;chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico&#8208;chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Cleavage of Cyclobutanols Through Ir&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Activation: Mechanistic and Synthetic Aspects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium behaves differently! Unexpectedly, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of cyclobutanols to give &#946;&#8208;chiral ketones proceeds through a different mechanism as compared to related Rh&#8208;catalyzed reactions. This was shown by deuteration experiments, kinetic isotope effect measurements and DFT calculations. The developed method for the catalytic enantioselective desymmetrization is of particular value in the synthesis of chromane&#8208;related natural products from readily accessible spirocyclobutanols.







Abstract
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed conversion of prochiral tert&#8208;cyclobutanols to &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted ketones proceeds under comparably mild conditions in toluene (45&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C) and is particularly suited for the enantioselective desymmetrization of &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted substrates to give products with a quaternary chirality center with up to 95&#8201;% ee using DTBM&#8208;SegPhos as a chiral ligand. Deuteration experiments and kinetic isotope effect measurements revealed major mechanistic differences to related RhI&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Supported by DFT calculations we propose the initial formation of an IrIII hydride intermediate, which then undergoes a &#946;&#8208;C elimination (C&#8722;C bond activation) prior to reductive C&#8722;H elimination. The computational model also allows the prediction of the stereochemical outcome. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed cyclobutanol cleavage is broadly applicable but fails for substrates bearing strongly coordinating groups. The method is of particular value for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of substituted chromanes related to the tocopherols and other natural products.

         <dc:description>
Shining light on organoborates: A photocatalyzed oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of functionalized organoborates is described, providing a diverse range of biaryl and olefin products. The mechanism of this C&#8722;C bond formation was investigated through quantum chemical calculations, revealing an unusual boracyclic intermediate.







Abstract
Readily accessible tetraorganoborate salts undergo selective coupling reactions under blue light irradiation in the presence of catalytic amounts of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free acridinium photocatalysts to furnish unsymmetrical biaryls, heterobiaryls and arylated olefins. This represents an interesting conceptual approach to forge C&#8722;C bonds between aryl, heteroaryl and alkenyl groups under smooth photochemical conditions. Computational studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism of the transformation.

Cascade reaction: The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides through a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides is reported. The combination of a cobalt catalyst together with a phosphine ligand and a metal reductive agent results in soft conditions compatible with a wide range of functional groups. The cascade reaction is used as a key step in a flexible synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;deoxyeseroline, a pyrrolidino&#8208;indoline alkaloid.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides was developed. The reaction was highly chemoselective, allowing the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides possessing a variety of functional groups. The method was used as the key step to synthesize an alkaloid, (&#177;)&#8208;deoxyeseroline. Mechanistic investigations suggest a radical process.

         <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). Compound 3 displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound 3 also exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.







Abstract
5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). The DHDAT units are planar in the C&#8722;C linked dimer 1 but perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8722;N linked dimers 2 and 3 (from X&#8208;ray analysis). The electronic ground&#8208;state interaction between the two units is large in 1 and small in 2 and 3. The emission behavior of 3 is different from that of other dimers and its monomer; it displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound 3 exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.

         <title>Cationic Bismuth Aminotroponiminates: Charge Controls Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry with bismuth: Snapshots of the redox chemistry of heavy p&#8208;block elements are difficult to obtain and remain rare to date. This work demonstrates that redox&#8208;active ligands in the coordination sphere of bismuth facilitate well&#8208;behaved one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions according to cyclic voltammetry. The charge of the complexes (neutral vs. cationic) allows the spin density to shift either towards the ligand or towards the metal center. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Lichtenberg et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005186).

         <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles: A novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) retained its metallic nature in air and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of carbonyls, nitriles, and nitroarenes in water. The used nano&#8208;Ni2P could be easily handled and reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the stereoactive lone pair cation of SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 is achieved. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric dense structure. The material exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window and considerable environmental stabilities, which endow it a promising UV nonlinear optical material. Theoretical studies reveal that the functional SbIII with stereochemical active lone pair makes predominant contribution to the enhanced effect. More information can be found in the Communication by X.&#8208;T. An, G.&#8208;M. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004859).

         <title>Tuning the Molecular Packing of Self&#8208;Assembled Amphiphilic PtII Complexes by Varying the Hydrophilic Side&#8208;Chain Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray diffraction and advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies were combined as a new, general tool for detailed structural and supramolecular elucidation, using a series of amphiphilic PtII complexes as model compounds. Our approach provides an alternative for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible, which can be potentially applied to many other molecular and macromolecular platforms.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between molecular design and packing modes constitutes one of the major challenges in self&#8208;assembly and is essential for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high precision control over the supramolecular packing of amphiphilic PtII complexes by systematic variation of the hydrophilic side&#8208;chain length. A novel approach of general applicability based on complementary X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to establish a clear correlation between molecular features and supramolecular ordering. Systematically increasing the side&#8208;chain length gradually increases the steric demand and reduces the extent of aromatic interactions, thereby inducing a gradual shift in the molecular packing from parallel to a long&#8208;slipped organization. Notably, our findings highlight the necessity of advanced solid&#8208;state NMR techniques to gain structural information for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible. Our work further demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to modulate aromatic interaction strengths and packing arrangements that could be useful for the engineering of functional materials based on PtII and aromatic molecules.

Boron&#8208;induced oxygen defects: Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compound oxidation. This work introduces small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO3 crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects. The resulting Co3+ rich surface and large oxygen vacancies realized with the amorphous boron dispersed in LaCoO3 shows efficient propane oxidation activity.







Abstract
Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO3 crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, which are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C3H8) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces a high distortion of the LaCoO3 crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces a large proportion of bulk Co2+ species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Additionally, surface Co3+ species, as the acid sites, which are active for cleaving the C&#8722;H bonds of C3H8 molecules, are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co/B=0.93:0.07) displays the best C3H8 oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO2 and H2O, lasting 200&#8197;h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites by the regulation of amorphous boron dispersion.

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent tetracyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyri(mi)dines can be generated by microwave&#8208;assisted high order (8+2) thermal cycloadditions between in situ formed benzynes and the corresponding bicyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyr(im)idines. These cycloadducts absorb and emit photons in the 400&#8208;500 nm region and are efficiently uptaken by cells with low cytotoxicity. Upon irradiation, these molecules generate singlet oxygen and are able to kill cancer cells at low concentration, thus emerging as promising candidates for photodynamic therapy and fluorescence imaging. .

         <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes were synthesized in which two B&#8592;N units were introduced at different positions. They showed significantly different opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance.







Abstract
The B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and it is isoelectronic to C&#8722;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how the B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we developed three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules in which two B&#8592;N units were introduced at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.

         <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Framework for ferroptosis: A parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy has been designed based on a drug&#8208;sandwiched metal&#8211;organic framework (EsMOF) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The catalytic MOF can initiate dual Fenton reactions to generate abundant .OH. Through MOF&#8208;catalyzed .OH generation and GSH depletion&#8208;inactive GPX4, the catalytic nanomedicine can effectively inhibit tumor growth, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.







Abstract
Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell&#8208;death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between the MOF layers with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide as spacers. In a tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs through glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide, while erastin&#8208;aggravated glutathione depletion down&#8208;regulated glutathione peroxidase 4; this then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy that effectively inhibited tumor growth in live mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.

         <title>Recent Advances in Enantioselective Desymmetrizations of Prochiral Oxetanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prochiral oxetanes are excellent candidates for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers via enantioselective desymmetrization. Recent methods relying on transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis allow access to a remarkably diverse set of compounds, which are highlighted and put into context.







Abstract
Strain relief of oxetanes offers a plethora of opportunities for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers. In this context, enantioselective desymmetrization has been identified as a powerful tool to construct molecular complexity and this has led to the development of elegant strategies on the basis of transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This review highlights recent examples that harness the inherent reactivity of prochiral oxetanes and offers an outlook on the immense possibilities for synthetic application.

         <title>A General Approach to Intermolecular Olefin Hydroacylation through Light&#8208;Induced HAT Initiation: An Efficient Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Aliphatic Ketones and Functionalized Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trying out a new HAT: An efficient light&#8208;induced HAT process for the radical intermolecular hydroacylation of unactivated substrates allows the synthesis of a large number of long&#8208;chain aliphatic ketones containing numerous synthetically valuable functional groups in good yields. The results obtained in a series of studies indicate a radical chain mechanism for the hydroacylation process.







Abstract
Herein, an operationally simple, environmentally benign and effective method for intermolecular radical hydroacylation of unactivated substrates by employing photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) initiation is described. The use of commercially available and inexpensive photoinitiators (Ph2CO and NHPI) makes the process attractive. The olefin hydroacylation protocol applies to a wide array of substrates bearing numerous functional groups and many complex structural units. The reaction proves to be scalable (up to 5&#8197;g). Different functionalized fatty acids, petrochemicals and naturally occurring alkanes can be synthesized with this protocol. A radical chain mechanism is implicated in the process.

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <title>Conformational switching through the one&#8208;electron reduction of an acridinium&#8208;based&#160;&#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8208;carbenium interaction present in these complexes.&#160; Here, we show that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9&#8208; N &#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au &#8211; Acr distance.&#160; Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O &#8211; carbenium interaction.&#160; These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.&#160; These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Metal&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of weak bases and mild conditions is currently the most sustainable and attractive synthetic approach for the preparation of Late&#8208;Transition metal complexes, some of which are widely used in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we report the first examples of the use of continuous flow reactors for the preparation of Cu(I), Au(I) and Pd(II)&#8208;NHC complexes using as starting materials cuprate, aurate or palladate species and a microreactor containing a weak base, K 2 CO 3&#160; . All reactions examined proceed under extremely mild conditions and make use of technical grade acetone as solvent. The scalability of the process was exemplified in a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of [Cu(IPr)Cl].</dc:description>

A look at structure: The synthesis and characterization of a hetero&#8208;dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond is determined for the first time in the molecular structure.







Abstract

The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond was determined for the first time in the molecular structure. This structural motif was further analyzed by temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies: In solution at room temperature the coordinative bond fluctuates, while it can be frozen at low temperatures. Preliminary reactivity studies revealed a reduced reactivity of the copper(I) moiety towards dioxygen. The results adumbrate why nature is avoiding metal porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bonds by fixing reactive metal centers in a predetermined distance to each other within multimetallic enzymatic reaction centers.

The spirocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents containing 4&#8208;oxazolidinone ring are prepared via a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of azaoxyallyl cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones. They display satisfactory stability and solubility in organic solvents. Using them as precursors, both 4,1&#8208;benzoxazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones and 1,3&#8208;diynes derivatives were afforded in one&#8208;pot under copper (I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a [3+2] cycloaddition of aza&#8208;oxyallylic cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones for synthesis of new &#955;3&#8208;iodanes containing spirocyclic 4&#8208;oxazolidinone has been developed. This cyclic &#955;3&#8208;iodanes display stability in air and excellent solubility in organic solvent. Using them as substrate, both the 4,1&#8208;benzoxazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones and symmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes derivatives were afforded in high yield under copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

         <title>Cellular Fucosylation Inhibitors Based on Fluorinated Fucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphates**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological of pathological activities. In this study, new fucosylation inhibitors based on fluorination of fucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphates were developed. Inhibitors A2FF1P and B2FF1P are potent, specific, non&#8208;toxic, inhibit fucosylation for multiple days and have a known mechanism of action. These new tools will help study the role of fucosylation in health and disease and are potential therapeutic candidates.







Abstract
Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Inhibition of fucose expression emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for example in cancer, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we found that protected 2&#8208;fluorofucose 1&#8208;phosphate efficiently inhibits cellular fucosylation with a four to seven times higher potency than known inhibitor 2FF, independently of the anomeric stereochemistry. Nucleotide sugar analysis revealed that both the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GDP&#8208;2FF anomers are formed inside the cell. In conclusion, we developed A2FF1P and B2FF1P as potent new tools for studying the role of fucosylation in health and disease and they are potential therapeutic candidates.

         <title>Enantiopure Calcium Iminophosphonamide Complexes: Synthesis, Photoluminescence, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glowing bones: Enantiopure homoleptic iminophosphonamide calcium complexes have been prepared. These show rich photoluminescence properties and catalytic activity in the hydroboration of ketones.







Abstract
The synthesis of calcium complexes ligated by three different chiral iminophosphonamide ligands, L&#8208;H (L=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}2]), L&#8242;&#8208;H (L&#8242;=[Ph2P{NDipp}{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}]), (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), and L&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;H (L&#8242;&#8242;=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)naph}2]), (naph=naphthyl) is presented. The resulting structures [L2Ca], [L&#8242;2Ca], and [L&#8242;&#8242;2Ca] represent the first examples of enantiopure homoleptic calcium complexes based on this type of ligands. The calcium complexes show blue&#8211;green photoluminescence (PL) in the solid state, which is especially bright at low temperatures. Whereas the emission of [L&#8242;&#8242;2Ca] is assigned to the fluorescence of naphthyl groups, the PL of [L2Ca] and [L&#8242;2Ca] is contributed by long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), with a strong variation of the PL lifetimes over the temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K. Furthermore, an excellent catalytic activity was found for these complexes in hydroboration of ketones at room temperature, although no enantioselectivity was achieved.

         <title>Isoindolinone Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Type Transition Metal Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoindolinone motif can found in a large variety biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the central role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.







Abstract
Isoindolinone structure is an important privileged scaffold found in a large variety of naturally occurring as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8722;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.

         <title>Optical Characteristics of Hybrid Macrocycles with Dithienogermole and Tricoordinate Boron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional elements: New macrocyclic compounds containing tricoordinate boron and germanium show characteristic fluoride responses in their optical properties, depending on their structures. This indicates that the element&#8208;hybrid macrocyclic system is promising as a new class of fluoride sensor material.







Abstract
The introduction of unconventional elements into &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has been studied to manipulate the electronic states and properties of compounds. Herein, boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing hybrid macrocycles, as a new class of element&#8208;hybrid conjugated systems, have been synthesized. The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille cross coupling of bis(bromothienyl)borane and bis(trimethylstannylthienyl)&#8208; or bis(trimethylstannylphenyl)&#8208;substituted dithienogermoles as the boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing building blocks, respectively, produced a mixture of several macrocyclic compounds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the 2:2 coupling product revealed a planar structure with a cavity inside the macrocycle. The optical properties of the macrocyclic products indicated rather small electronic interactions between the building units. However, intramolecular photoenergy transfer from the dithienogermole unit to the boron unit was clearly observed with respect to the fluorescence spectra.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a&#160;  meta  &#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2&#8217;&#8208;position. Usually, a 120&#176; bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and&#160;  1  H,&#160;  13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen&#8208;bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro&#173;chemical reactions that involve the production of OH &#8208; and the con&#173;sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re&#173;duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro&#173;gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activi&#173;ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt&#8208;nano&#173;sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#173;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a Re(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system we explore is a&#160;  fac  &#8208; [ Re(CO)  3  (TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl ] &#160;complexe, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ = 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[  i  ]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;  c  ]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirm the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived&#160;  3  MLCT state is observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remains as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is over: A family of functionalised, asymmetric ditopic ligands was synthesised from a common precursor. Each ligand was capable of self&#8208;assembling with PdII ions to selectively form low&#8208;symmetry cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocages. Due to the isostructural nature of the ligand framework, multiple ligands were able to be combined to generate combinatorial libraries containing heteroleptic, multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry nanocages.







Abstract
Although many impressive metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high fidelity in the self&#8208;assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry architectures.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts: Exploring the Effects of Ionic Character</title>

It's a switch! The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provide a route to understanding the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs; see figure). Through solvatochromic analysis of the open&#8208;form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational theory, we have analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs.







Abstract
The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provide a route to understanding the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). Through solvatochromic analysis of the open&#8208;form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational theory, we have analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs. First&#8208; and third&#8208;generation architectures lead to a higher zwitterionic resonance contribution of the open form and a zwitterionic closed form, whereas the second&#8208;generation architecture possesses a less charge&#8208;separated open form and neutral closed form. This can be correlated with equilibrium control and photoswitching solvent compatibility. As a result of the high contribution of the zwitterionic resonance forms of first&#8208; and third&#8208;generation DASAs, we were able to control their switching kinetics by means of ion concentration, whereas second&#8208;generation DASAs were less affected. Importantly, these results show how the previously reported concentration dependence of DASAs is not universal, and that DASAs with a more hybrid structure in the open form can achieve photoswitching at high concentrations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making it linear: The right combination of lanthanide metal and Lewis acid affords the regio&#8208; and stereoselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes with a wide range of aldehydes. Unprecedented ipso substitution is observed, and the regioselectivity is investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The development of new fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. Herein, the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes was achieved using a simple La/I2/DIBAL&#8208;Cl system via a selective C&#8722;F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provided homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF2&#8208;alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron&#8208;poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF3 group in a diene was observed, which, according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis&#8208;acidic lanthanum metal.

         <title>Ditopic Chelators of Dicopper Centers for Enhanced Tyrosinases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ty combined: The combination of known tyrosinase (Ty) inhibitors improves inhibition activities, which is tested and compared for isolated enzymes (fungal, bacterial, and human). The interaction mode with the dicopper active site is discussed by using a functional model of the active site associated with theoretical modeling. One ditopic compound displays melanogenesis suppression in melanoma cells.







Abstract
Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, the possible synergic effect generated by a combination of known inhibitors is studied. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial, and human) as well as on melanin production by lysates from the human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared with the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO&#8208;TSC. To elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, binding studies with a tyrosinase bio&#8208;inspired model of the dicopper(II) center were investigated. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA&#8208;TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Based Pharmacophore Inhibits Intracellular MYC Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden bullet: Gold&#8208;based warheads capable of protein binding and ligand&#8208;affinity chemistry enable modification of the MYC protein and inhibition of MYC activity in cells. This is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study to modify intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions such as MYC/MAX by using metal&#8208;mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold.







Abstract
Direct targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins, including MYC, by small molecules for biomedical applications would resolve a longstanding issue in chemical biology and medicine. Thus, we developed gold&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule MYC reagents that engage MYC inside cells and modulate MYC transcriptional activity. Lead compounds comprise an affinity ligand and a gold(I) or gold(III) warhead capable of protein chemical modification. Cell&#8208;based MYC target engagement studies via CETSA and co&#8208;immunoprecipitation reveal specific interaction of compounds with MYC in cells. The lead gold(I) reagent, 1, demonstrates superior cell&#8208;killing potential (up to 35&#8208;fold) in a MYC&#8208;dependent manner when compared to 10058&#8208;F4 in cells including the TNBC, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231. Subsequently, 1 suppresses MYC transcription factor activity via functional colorimetric assays, and gene&#8208;profiling using whole&#8208;cell transcriptomics reveals significant modulation of MYC target genes by 1. These findings point to metal&#8208;mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold as a promising strategy to develop chemical probes and anticancer therapeutics targeting MYC.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8208;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  &#8208;H and C  sp3  &#8208;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  &#8208;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  &#8208;Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  &#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis &#8208;[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of the previously reported AuSiP that exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis via electron localization function (ELF) suggests covalent 2c&#8208;2e Tt&#8208;Pn bonds, and 3&#8208;center Au&#8208;Tt &#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn &#8208;Au bonds with 1.6 e  &#8208;  /bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies support the covalent and not ionic nature of Au&#8208;Pn and Au&#8208;Tt bonds.

         <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallics tricks for actinide extended structures: Covalency in actinide complexes has long been studied for both its fundamental interest and potential applications for minor actinides separation. In this concept paper, covalency in actinides is introduced and illustrated with several examples from the current literature. It is shown that actinide chalcogenide extended structures may serve as auxiliary platforms for studying covalency.







Abstract
Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the limited radial extent of the 4f orbitals, there is almost no 4f electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5f orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the d orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, a general description of covalency in actinide compounds is provided. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, the current state of the field is illustrated by using several examples from the recent literature. This paper is concluded by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the limited radial extent of the 4f orbitals, there is almost no 4f electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5f orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the d orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, a general description of covalency in actinide compounds is provided. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, the current state of the field is illustrated by using several examples from the recent literature. This paper is concluded by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Preparation of Functionalized Carbon&#8208;Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles with Sulfonated Arene Derivatives, a Study on Surface Functionalization and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonated magnetic nanoparticles may be used as catalysts or potentially as anticoagulants in blood. To achieve high activities, a high loading of sulfonate groups is desired. In this article we investigated the maximization of covalent functionalized sulfonate groups on the surface of carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles, assessed their stability and investigated the activity towards ring opening polymerization of glycidol.







Abstract
The functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles has been an important field in the last decade due to the versatile applications in catalysis and biomedicine. Generally, a high degree of functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles is desired. In this study, covalent functionalization of various aromatic sulfonic acids on carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles are investigated on surface functionalization yield and stability. The nanoparticles are prepared via covalent linkage of an in situ generated diazonium on the graphene&#8208;like surface. Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.

         <title>BN&#8208;Doped Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Tailoring 2D and 3D Porous Architectures through Molecular Editing of Borazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The borazine unit was used to prepare crystalline porous MOFs from specifically designed borazine carboxylate linkers. To evaluate the influence of the borazine rings on the gas adsorption properties, the analogous full&#8208;carbon carboxylate linker and the corresponding MOF were also prepared. The structure of the three MOFs was unambiguously determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
Building on the MOF approach to prepare porous materials, herein we report the engineering of porous BN&#8208;doped materials using tricarboxylic hexaarylborazine ligands, which are laterally decorated with functional groups at the full&#8208;carbon &#8216;inner shell&#8217;. Whilst an open porous 3D entangled structure could be obtained from the double interpenetration of two identical metal frameworks derived from the methyl substituted borazine, the chlorine&#8208;functionalised linker undergoes formation of a porous layered 2D honeycomb structure, as shown by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In this architecture, the borazine cores are rotated by 60&#176; in alternating layers, thus generating large rhombohedral channels running perpendicular to the planes of the networks. An analogous unsubstituted full&#8208;carbon metal framework was synthesised for comparison. The resulting MOF revealed a crystalline 3D entangled porous structure, composed by three mutually interpenetrating networks, hence denser than those obtained from the borazine linkers. Their microporosity and CO2 uptake were investigated, with the porous 3D BN&#8208;MOF entangled structure exhibiting a large apparent BET specific surface area (1091&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and significant CO2 reversible adsorption (3.31&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 1&#8197;bar and 273&#8197;K.

         <title>Cannabidiol Discovery and Synthesis&#8212;a Target&#8208;Oriented Analysis in Drug Production Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant potential: Demand for cannabidiol (CBD) has increased drastically in the recent years, so highly pure cannabinoids and its intermediates are an emerging market for use as an antiepileptic product. Despite numerous studies describing the isolation and purification of CBD from plant material, its production is still limited. A detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is provided.







Abstract
The current state of evidence and recommendations for cannabidiol (CBD) and its health effects change the legal landscape and aim to destigmatize its phytotherapeutic research. Recently, some countries have included CBD as an antiepileptic product for compassionate use in children with refractory epilepsy. The growing demand for CBD has led to the need for high&#8208;purity cannabinoids on the emerging market. The discovery and development of approaches toward CBD synthesis have arisen from the successful extraction of Cannabis plants for cannabinoid fermentation in brewer's yeast. To understand different contributions to the design and enhancement of the synthesis of CBD and its key intermediates, a detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is provided herein.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208;Based 3D Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8211;Property Correlation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpyridine&#8208;based MOFs: The main objective of this review is to highlight the design strategy of 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on 4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl substituted terpyridine derivatives, their structural features, and the important physicochemical properties related to the structures. The structure&#8211;property correlations could give rise to some concepts for the future design of terpyridine&#8208;based MOFs with desired properties.







Abstract
Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system is of utmost importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron&#8208;rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines is discussed. These ligands can be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.

         <title>Evidence for Atropisomerism in Polycyclic &#947;&#8208;Butenolides: Synthesis, Scope, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare cycles: Atropisomeric compounds are of tremendous importance in pharmaceuticals, bioactive natural products, and as chiral ligands in asymmetric synthesis. The most explored atropisomeric structures possess six&#8208;membered rings. We have designed and developed a novel approach for the synthesis of first examples of potential atropisomeric polycyclic butenolide derivatives from aryl&#8208;Z&#8208;enoate propargylic alcohols via an acid&#8208;mediated domino double cyclization.







Abstract
Design and development of a domino cyclative approach for the synthesis of new polycyclic &#947;&#8208;butenolides from &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;Z&#8208;enoate propargylic alcohols, through the interception of an intermediate of the Z&#8208;enoate&#8208;assisted Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, has been reported. A systematic NMR analysis of various derivatives of this class revealed and supported the potential atropisomerism associated with them. These molecules represent first examples of butenolide ring&#8208;based atropisomeric compounds in organic chemistry. The synthetic process involves a synchronous construction of both rings with concurrent creation of the potential stereogenic rotational axis.

         <title>An Anthracene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Photo&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formic Acid Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zr&#8208;based photoactive metal&#8208;organic framework was synthesized under solvothermal condition. It could reduce the carbon dioxide coupled with water oxidation under UV/Visible light. Also, it selectively reduced the carbon dioxide than the free ligand with a turn&#8208;over frequency (TOF) of 0.69&#8197;h&#8722;1 for formic acid and produced oxygen with a TOF of 0.54&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broad visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. Formic acid was the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a turn&#8208;over frequency (TOF) of 0.69&#8197;h&#8722;1 in addition to oxygen, which was produced with a TOF of 0.54&#8197;h&#8722;1. No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. The efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst is thus demonstrated here.

         <title>Light&#8208; and Manganese&#8208;Initiated Borylation of Aryl Diazonium Salts: Mechanistic Insight on the Ultrafast Time&#8208;Scale Revealed by Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopic Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;mediated borylation of aryl/heteroaryl diazonium salts emerges as a general and versatile synthetic methodology for the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl boronate esters. The MnI&#8208;carbonyl species generated under the reaction conditions has been revealed by time&#8208;resolved multiple probe spectroscopy (TRMPS&#8208;IR).







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;mediated borylation of aryl/heteroaryl diazonium salts emerges as a general and versatile synthetic methodology for the synthesis of the corresponding boronate esters. The reaction proved an ideal testing ground for delineating the Mn species responsible for the photochemical reaction processes, that is, involving either Mn radical or Mn cationic species, which is dependent on the presence of a suitably strong oxidant. Our findings are important for a plethora of processes employing Mn&#8208;containing carbonyl species as initiators and/or catalysts, which have considerable potential in synthetic applications.

MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  feature two&#8208;fold degree of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1%, respectively. N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1&#8242;  &#8210;  5&#8242;  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature.

Further,  3  &#8242;  also showed significant influence of amine functions in CO  2  uptake at high temperature due to the CO  2  &#8722;framework interactions. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  &#956;  M, respectively, and the Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 &#215; 10  3  , 1.79 &#215; 10  3  , 3.78 &#215; 10  3  , 4.04 &#215; 10  3  , and 3.21 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8722;1  , respectively.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

Perovskite solar cells: Advanced quantum chemical techniques are employed to explore the photophysical, photovoltaic, and optoelectronic properties as well as the structure&#8211;property relationship of R and HB1&#8211;HB10 molecules. The studied systems may be targeted for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest from researchers owing to their good photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long diffusion length of holes and electrons in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers has proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of a recently synthesized H&#8722;Bi molecule (R) is achieved with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (HB1&#8211;HB10) with a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;D backbone are obtained. The structure&#8211;property relationship, and optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of these newly designed hole transport materials are examined comprehensively and compared with reference molecules. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with the assistance of density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT. All the designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps (Eg=2.82&#8211;2.99&#8197;eV) compared with the R molecule (Eg=3.05&#8197;eV). The designed molecules express redshifting in their absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy, which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies. Further, density of states and molecular electrostatic potential analysis is performed to locate the different charge sites in the molecules. The reorganizational energies of holes and electrons are found to have good values, suggesting that these novel designed molecules are efficient hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells. In addition, the low binding energy values of the designed molecules (compared with R) offer high current charge density. Finally, complex study of HB9:PC61BM is also undertaken to understand the charge transfer between the molecules of the complex. The results of all analyses advocate that these novel designed HTMs are promising candidates for the construction of future high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Hematite Photoanode with Enhanced Bonding Energy Around Fe Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hematite photoanodes: By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 is transformed into a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in photocurrent density becomes much faster.







Abstract
Hematite nanoarrays are important photoanode materials. However, they suffer from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states; in particular, the surface states hinder the increase in photocurrent. A previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of an Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, it is found that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the key to suppressing the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 transforms to a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment constructs a nanoscale p&#8211;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25&#8197;V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8&#8197;times). This work pinpoints the key to suppressing the surface states and preparing a high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of hematite photoanodes.

An efficient approach to the type&#8197;III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed through a key Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone&#8208;type dienophile with chiral diol unit is employed to generate the desirable all&#8208;cis&#8208;trisubstituted cyclohexene with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity control. The subsequent selective sulfonylation of the diol unit followed by SN2 cyclization under hydrogenation conditions could construct the substituted piperidine ring. By using this approach, (&#8722;)&#8208;lepadin F is synthesized from ethyl l&#8208;lactate for the first time.

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr).

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp. Our quantum&#8208;chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of&#160; s &#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp.</dc:description>

         <title>Air Stable Iridium Catalysts for Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea&#8208;phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol.% loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart&#8208;Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in HFIP instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: The Subtle Equilibrium between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the gap: A new set of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts was computationally studied and prepared through the substitution on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. This allows for the modification of absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the isomers. This change provides a consistent redshift in the absorption maximum and a structural entry point for subsequent derivatization, although the reversibility is blocked.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying the donor and acceptor moieties to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly owing to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties is systematically explored, revealing the significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the open form. In particular, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to redshift the absorption while preserving the cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.

         <title>Boron&#8211;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B for cooperation: The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation (BLC) describes a specific mode of action by which distinctive intramolecular borane&#8208;based frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) activate chemical bonds. The central aspect of this concept is that the substituent at the borane that is involved in the bond activation becomes a datively bound ligand upon bond activation. The reactivity of systems that operate via BLC can complement those of classic intramolecular FLPs.







Abstract
The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, how the term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation evolved is reflected on and examples of bond activation by boron&#8211;ligand cooperation are discussed. It is furthermore shown that systems that operate via boron&#8211;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis are summarized.

         <title>Combined Ex and In Situ Measurements Elucidate the Dynamics of Retained Species in ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 Catalysts Used in the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction generates many retained species in the catalyst that evolve from active species for the formation of olefins to deactivating species leaving coke deposits. The active species can be detected by a combination of ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) and extraction measurements whereas the deactivating species by ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed oxidation (TPO), and both of them by in situ FTIR spectroscopy, which allows their dynamics to be followed in the MTO reaction performance.







Abstract
The dynamics of the retained species on ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts are studied by using a combination of temperature&#8208;programmed desorption/oxidation, ex situ analysis, and in situ FTIR spectroscopic measurements over the entire conversion range, using fixed&#8208;bed and spectroscopic cell reactors, in continuous and discontinuous mode. The results point to the appropriateness of the combined methodologies to track the interconversion of active into deactivating species. A statistically relevant (supported by linear regression and multivariate analysis) association of the observations is found by using the different complementary methodologies. The kinetics of this interconversion depends on the initial conversion (tuned by acidity and space time) and microporous topology, and involve: (i)&#8197;in the ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts, the diffusion of monocyclic aromatics toward the exterior of the zeolite to form coke, and (ii)&#8197;in the SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts, the obstruction of the cavities by aromatics that grow into tetracyclic aromatic islands.

     alt="Combined Ex and In Situ Measurements Elucidate the Dynamics of Retained Species in ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 Catalysts Used in the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins&lt;/b&gt; (MTO) reaction generates many retained species in the catalyst that evolve from active species for the formation of olefins to deactivating species leaving coke deposits. The active species can be detected by a combination of ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) and extraction measurements whereas the deactivating species by ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed oxidation (TPO), and both of them by in situ FTIR spectroscopy, which allows their dynamics to be followed in the MTO reaction performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of the retained species on ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts are studied by using a combination of temperature&#8208;programmed desorption/oxidation, ex situ analysis, and in situ FTIR spectroscopic measurements over the entire conversion range, using fixed&#8208;bed and spectroscopic cell reactors, in continuous and discontinuous mode. The results point to the appropriateness of the combined methodologies to track the interconversion of active into deactivating species. A statistically relevant (supported by linear regression and multivariate analysis) association of the observations is found by using the different complementary methodologies. The kinetics of this interconversion depends on the initial conversion (tuned by acidity and space time) and microporous topology, and involve: (i)&#8197;in the ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts, the diffusion of monocyclic aromatics toward the exterior of the zeolite to form coke, and (ii)&#8197;in the SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts, the obstruction of the cavities by aromatics that grow into tetracyclic aromatic islands.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;pressure nucleation of low&#8208;density polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New polymorphs &#946; and &#947; of bis&#8208;3&#8208;nitrophenyl disulphide, crystallized above 0.3 GPa, are less dense than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph &#945;. This counterinitiative density relation results from the high&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent kinetic crystallization. The work performed by pressure compensates the high entropy and temperature product, substantiated in varied conformers and increased chemical potential. Pressure&#8208;increased viscosity promotes the kinetic polymorphs, in accordance with empirical Ostwald&#8217;s rule of stages. It contrasts to mechanochemical techniques, favouring high&#8208;density polymorphs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Uncommon Fluorescent Recognition Mechanism Towards Pertechnetate Using a Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic AIE Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium&#8208;99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4&#8208;), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half&#8208;life and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4&#8208; is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported a new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8208;organic framework (ZJU&#8208;X8) bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4&#8208; detection. ZJU&#8208;X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4&#8208;. Such uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by the batch sorption experiments and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. It is found that only TcO4&#8208; could enter into the body of ZJU&#8208;X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4&#8208; and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the &#960;* orbital and thus reduced the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* energy gap, resulting in a red&#8208;shift in the fluorescent spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to Tetracyclic Eight&#8208;Membered Lactams through a Dearomative Heck Reaction and an Alkylative Ring&#8208;Opening Driven by the Photoexcited Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An external&#8208;photocatalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven alkylative ring&#8208;opening of stable spiroindolines was newly developed to construct indolo&#8208; and benzoannulated eight&#8208;membered lactams. The spiroindolines were prepared from tetrahydro&#8208; &#946; &#8208;carbolines by a dearomative Heck reaction. Mechanistic experimental studies on the alkylative ring opening suggest that a photoredox pathway is involved, in which the spiroindoline performs as both reagent and photosensitizer. DFT calculations show that the stereoselective radical addition toward a cyclic alkene is the key to the diastereoselective&#160;formation of tetracyclic medium&#8208;sized membered lactams.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Four Na&#8208;based ternary infrared nonlinear&#8208;optical (IR NLO) materials, Na  6  MQ  4  (M = Zn, Cd, Q = S, Se), were prepared via high temperature flux method.  The crystal structure of the compounds is built up of isolated [MQ  4  ]&#8208;tetrahedra and a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework formed by the NaQ  n  (n = 4, 5) units. The two selenides, Na  6  MSe  4  (M = Zn, Cd), as promising IR NLO materials, show moderate second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (0.9 and 0.5 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) with good phase&#8208;matching behaviors, as well as high laser damage thresholds (2 and 1.9 &#215; AgGaS  2  ).The two sulfides, Na  6  MS  4  (M =Zn, Cd), exhibit higher  laser damage thresholds  (13 and 4 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) but smaller SHG responses (0.3 and 0.2 &#215; AgGaS  2  ). The theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that t  he SHG effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ  4  NLO&#8208;active units, which provides a new insight into the design of novel IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics for Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.</dc:description>

We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicyclic phenyl&#8208;ethynyl architectures: Synthesis of a 1,4&#8208;bis (phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene banister</title>

         <dc:description>The novel diacetylene bridged terphenylic macrocycle 1 is presented and discussed in the context of rotationally restricted &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; oligomers. The 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene bridge of diacetylene 1 is significantly longer than its terphenyl backbone, forcing the bridge to bend around the central pylon. The synthesis of molecule 1 is based to a large extent on acetylene scaffolding strategies, profiting from orthogonal alkyne protection groups to close both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling sequentially. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the bicyclic target structure 1 are analyzed. In&#8208;depth NMR investigations not only reveal an unexpected spatial arrangement with both oligomer strands bent alongside the backbone, but also display the limited stability of the model compound in the presence of molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent&#160; Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane pro&#173;perties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucle&#173;ation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order para&#173;meter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Simi&#173;larly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligo&#173;meric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8208;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical&#8208;Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. We herein report extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts. We found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO energies and LUMO energies of the corresponding triazolylidene based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversiblility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR&#8208; spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type gold&#8208;MIC phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold coordinated MIC&#8208;radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;oxidation controlled surface pattern with responsive wrinkle and fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wrinkles and photo&#8208;oxidation reactions are widely found in soft materials, which are intimately associated with the failure of materials and structures. It is expected that the photo&#8208;oxidation process will have a positive effect on the material and its surface. Here, we report the photo&#8208;oxidation of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dietheylaminophenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) imidazole (DEA&#8208;TAI) into a bilayer wrinkling system to control surface wrinkle and fluorescent pattern, in which a supramolecular polymer network composed of carboxyl acid containing copolymer (PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA) and DEA&#8208;TAI was used as the skin layer. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo&#8208;oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA&#8208;TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA and DEA&#8208;TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkle morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI caused by UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to pH, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH 3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure which has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities.&#160; It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology.&#160; DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations.&#160; The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications.&#160; In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs.&#160; Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23 &#176;C.&#160; NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl groups of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;substituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products. In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. We now report a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties, and Device Fabrication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, was prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relative high quantum yields (up to 73.6% for  FMesB&#8208;Cz  as a neat film). Highly twisted donor groups suppress the charge transfer but the intrinsic photophysical properties of 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain and the new compounds possess enhanced stability to the atmosphere. All of these compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for applications in materials science. OLED devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibit strong yellow&#8208;greenish electro&#8208;luminescence with maximum luminance intensity &gt; 22000 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  . This is the first example of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and helps us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties and improving their stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated approaches and coupling agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent&#8208;mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5&#8208;10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro&#8208;flow technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late&#8208;Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigoids represent natural product&#8208;based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. Thus a biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C&#8211;H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l&#8208;tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade gives Boc&#8208;protected dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. The halogen substituent allows for late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of 5,5&#8217;&#8208; and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and ambiphilic reactivity of metalated diorgano&#8208;phosphonite boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH&#8208;substituted precursors and silyl amides. While potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved unstable towards self&#8208;condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>How the physicochemical properties of the bulk material affect the ablation crater profile, mass balance and bubble dynamics during single&#8208;pulse, nanosecond laser ablation in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine &#8211; The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As sulfur containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry,  e. g.  , in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state  via  single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45 min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20 K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodamines with a chloronicotinic acid fragment for live cell superresolution STED** microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formylation of 2,6&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5&#8208;  R  &#8208;nicotinic acids at C&#8208;4 followed by condensation with 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;  N,N  &#8208;dimethylaniline gave analogs of the popular TAMRA fluorescent dye with a 2,6&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5&#8208;R&#8208;nicotinic acid residues (  R  = H, F). The following reaction with thioglycolic acid is selective, involves only one chlorine atom at the carbon between pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylic acid group and affords new rhodamine dyes absorbing at 564 / 573 nm and emitting at 584 / 597 nm (  R  = H / F, in aq. PBS). Conjugates of the dyes with &#8220;small molecules&#8221; provided specific labeling (covalent and non&#8208;covalent) of organelles as well as of components of the cytoskeleton in living cells and were combined with fluorescent probes prepared from  610CP  and  SiR  dyes and applied in two&#8208;color STED microscopy with a 775 nm STED laser.</dc:description>

Conjugates of the dyes with &#8220;small molecules&#8221; provided specific labeling (covalent and non&#8208;covalent) of organelles as well as of components of the cytoskeleton in living cells and were combined with fluorescent probes prepared from  610CP  and  SiR  dyes and applied in two&#8208;color STED microscopy with a 775 nm STED laser.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrothermal&#8208;induced formation of well&#8208;defined hollow carbons with curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C sites for Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free carbons have been regarded as one of the promising materials alternative to precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), due to their high activity and stability. In this paper, well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are firstly achieved by an ammonia hydrothermal synthesis that are environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production in industry, using a commercial solid&#8208;type black carbon as raw material. Moreover, the shell thickness of the NHCs can be easily tuned by this hydrothermal strategy. Zn&#8208;air battery test results reveal the shell thickness&#8208;dependent activity and durability for ORR over the NHCs, which exceed that obtained by commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%, JM). The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface, served as the main active sites for ORR as evidenced by DFT calculations. The proposed approach may open a way for designing curved hollow carbons with high graphitization degree and dopant nitrogen level for metal&#8208;air batteries or fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties i.e., porosity, packing, conjugation is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational molecular design of multifunctional blue material based on phenanthroimidazole derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with EQEs over 5% are still scarce in OLEDs. In this work, by introducing the [1,2,4] triazolo [1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit to the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole, two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPBTPA were obtained. Based on systematic photophysical analysis, we found that the TP block is suitable for constructing HLCT emitters. Its moderate electron withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring the color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the increased phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increases the oscillator strength, but also shortens the stokes shift. TDDFT calculations point to facile RISC processes in PTPBTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. PTPBTPA presents impressive performances when serving as non&#8208;doped device (EQE  max  = 7.11%, CIE: (0.15, 0.09)), as well as a high&#8208;performance host for yellow and red PhOLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dye into PTPBTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85% was achieved. The successful design of PTPBTPA not only provides an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrates the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>High temperature proton conduction in LaSbO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanum orthoantimonate was synthesized using a solid&#8208;state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol% Ca in La&#8208;site, were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X&#8208;ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P2  1  /n. Dilatometry revealed that material expands non&#8208;linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown, however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56&#215;10  &#8208;6  1/K. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at order 10  &#8208;6  S/cm at 800&#176;C, but this can be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time when protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron catalyzed double bond isomerization: evidence for an Fe(I)/Fe(III) catalytic cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H 3 N&#183;BH 3 ). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951; 2 &#8208;coordinated alkene Fe(I) complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an Fe(III) intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended D&#8208;A&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) as precursors were accessed  via  Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide enables the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics are noted for the two configurations.

Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborate the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended D&#8208;A&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) as precursors were accessed  via  Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives.

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The permercuration of ferrocene is achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10 equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2  in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10  (X = O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X = O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X = Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, we present the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes: FeC10(HgX)10  (X = Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Pseudocapacitance Filling Charge&#8208;Discharge Voltage Gap of Flexible Hybrid Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) because of kinetically sluggish rate of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side, and thus an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly pursued. Here, a honeycomb&#8208;like MnCo2O4.5 spheres, as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, has been demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by the Mn (IV) induced oxygen vacancy defects and multi&#8208;active sites. Importantly, the rich multivalent ion and defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive&#8208;region of ORR and OER, thus affording a low charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) when it is employed in the flexible hybrid Zn&#8208;base battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights in the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photohomolysis and Photoheterolysis in Aryl Sulfonates and Aryl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) has a role in different respects including the application in eco&#8208;sustainable arylations, in the design of innovative photoacid generators and in biological applications. However, the fate of the photoreaction depends on several factors namely the nature of the sulfonate/phosphate group, the substituents present on the aromatic ring and the polarity of the medium. Aim of this work is the photophysical investigation of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates by laser flash photolysis experiments, to have insights on their photoreactive pathways for their possible applications. The judicious choice of the leaving group and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring may lead either to a photohomolysis of the ArO&#8208;X bond or a photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8208;OX bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and related BF2 derivatives with significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and related BF&#8322; derivatives were synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a red shift by increasing the solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to the more polarized excited state, with respect to the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibit a weak emission, attributable to the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism by addition of BF&#8323;&#183;OEt&#8322; which affords the related BF&#8322; complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both b&#8208;ketoimines and BF&#8322; complexes, examined in mixtures of CH&#8323;CN/H&#8322;O, exhibit a significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground and excited state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by using time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the EFISH technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 value of all &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increases upon the formation of the related BF&#8322; complex, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground state dipole moment. Some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.</dc:description>
