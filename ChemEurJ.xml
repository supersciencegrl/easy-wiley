         <title>Divergent Electrochemical Synthesis of Indoles through pKa Regulation of Amides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A divergent synthetic approach to access highly substituted indole scaffolds is illustrated. By virtue of a tunable electrochemical strategy, distinct control over the C&#8208;3 substitution pattern was achieved by employing two analogous 2&#8208;styrylaniline precursors. The chemoselectivity is governed by the fine&#8208;tuning of the acidity of the amide proton, relying on the appropriate selection of N&#8208;protecting groups, and assisted by the reactivity of the electrogenerated intermediates. Detailed mechanistic investigations based on cyclic voltametric experiments and computational studies revealed the crucial role of water additive, which assists the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer event for highly acidic amide precursors, followed by an energetically favorable intramolecular C&#8210;N coupling, causing exclusive fabrication of the C&#8208;3 unsubstituted indoles. Alternatively, the implementation of an electrogenerated cationic olefin activator delivers the C&#8208;3 substituted indoles through the preferential nucleophilic nature of the N&#8208;acyl amides. This electrochemical approach of judicious selection of N&#8208;protecting groups to regulate pKa/E&#176; provides an expansion in the domain of switchable generation of heterocyclic derivatives in a sustainable fashion, with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Covalent and Supramolecular Polymerization to reinforce Perylenebisimide Photosynthetic &#8220;Quantasomes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PSII&#8208;inspired quantasomes have emerged as promising artificial photosystems evolving oxygen from water due to their integrated multi&#8208;chromophore asset, hierarchical architecture, and efficient light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. In this study, we adopt a combined covalent and supramolecular strategy by implementing a poly&#8208;styrene backbone that reinforces proximity and pairing between adjacent perylenebisimide (PBI) quantasome units. The covalent fixation of the quantasome network results in a significant enhancement of the photoelectrocatalytic performance on engineered IO&#8208;ITO photoanodes, with up to 290% photocurrent increase (J cm&#8208;2 up to 100 &#181;A, &#955; &gt; 450 nm, applied bias &lt; 1.23 V vs RHE, F.E.O2 &gt; 80%) compared to the non&#8208;polymerized analog. Moreover, the direct PBI&#8208;quantasome polymerization on the photoanode surface was performed by light irradiation of the radical initiator 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobis(2&#8208;methylpropionamidine), improving the photoelectrode robustness under high solar irradiance (&gt; 8 suns) and limiting the photocurrent loss (&lt; 20%) at 1.52 V vs RHE compared to the non&#8208;polymerized system.</dc:description>

         <title>Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite with Near&#8208;Infrared II Mechanoluminescence for Spatiotemporally Selective Immune Activation in Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immune regulation of the lymphatic system, especially the lymph node (LN),&#160;is of great significance for the treatment of diseases and the inhibition of pathogenic organisms spreading in the body. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN in vivo remains a challenge due to tissue depth and off&#8208;target effects. Furthermore, minimally invasive and real&#8208;time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) luminescence is designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN. The NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in&#160;LN to activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence of FURIN provides real&#8208;time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation strategy in vivo with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoxides by A Cyclic Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically pure sulfoxides are valuable organosulfur compounds extensively employed in medicinal and organic synthesis. In this study, we present a biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system designed for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. The system involves the cooperation of a low&#8208;enantioselective chimeric oxidase SMO (styrene monooxygenase) with a high&#8208;enantioselective reductase MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A), facilitating &#8220;non&#8208;selective oxidation and selective reduction&#8221; cycles for prochiral sulfide oxidation. The regeneration of requisite cofactors for MsrA and SMO was achieved via a cascade catalysis process involving three auxiliary enzymes, sustained by cost&#8208;effective D&#8208;glucose. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a series of heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were synthesized through this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one step&#8221; cascade reaction. The obtained compounds exhibited high yields of &gt;90% and demonstrated enantiomeric excess (ee) values exceeding 90%. This study represents an unconventional and efficient biocatalytic way in utilizing the low&#8208;enantioselective oxidase for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Direct Arylation of Distyrylbenzene: Strong Dual&#8208;state Fluorescence and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach has been employed to introduce different aryl groups (neutral, electron&#8208;withdrawing, electron&#8208;rich aryl groups) onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety. The compounds possess strong dual&#8208;state (solution and solid state) fluorescence with fluorescence quantum yields reaching up to &gt;98&#8201;%. One of the compounds exhibits visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism with a colour from pristine light yellow to orange.







Abstract
Distyrylbenzenes (DSBs) are well&#8208;known for their strong multicolour fluorescence. Fluorescence tuning of DSB via further functionalization/arylation, on the other hand, is uncommon. This paper reports a Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach for introducing different aryl groups onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety (7) in high yields (67&#8211;72&#8201;%). The versatile methodology allows the substitution of neutral [tolyl (1)], electron&#8208;deficient [p&#8208;formyl benzene (2), p&#8208;acetyl benzene (3), p&#8208;nitrobenzene (4)] and electron&#8208;rich [carbazole (5), triphenylamine (6)] aryl groups. The electron&#8208;deficient aryls render mono&#8208;substitution, while the electron&#8208;rich counterparts promote di&#8208;substitution. The compounds (1&#8211;6) show blue, green, and yellow fluorescence in both the solution and solid states; the fluorescence quantum yields reach &gt;98&#8201;% and the peak maxima span from 425 to 560&#8197;nm. The mono&#8208;carbazole DSB (5) exhibit white light emission (WLM) in polar solvents (acetone, DMF, CH3CN, DMSO and NMP) with very high fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f) of 60&#8211;80&#8201;%. For WLM, such high efficiency (&#966;f) is somewhat uncommon. Moreover, visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism is demonstrated by the TPA&#8208;integrated DSB (6). The colour of 6 changes from pristine light yellow to orange, and the absorption maxima shifts from 372 to 1500&#8197;nm when a positive potential of 1.0&#8197;V vs Ag/Ag+ is applied. Moreover, the system shows high colouration efficiency in the NIR region with fast switching speeds for colouration and decolouration as fast as 0.98&#8197;s and 1.05&#8197;s.

Moreover, the system shows high colouration efficiency in the NIR region with fast switching speeds for colouration and decolouration as fast as 0.98&#8197;s and 1.05&#8197;s.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA mimic aromatic oligoamide helical foldamers possess no nucleobase and no ribose&#8208;phosphate backbones. Nevertheless, their structure can be designed so as to reproduce typical features of nucleic acids such has palindromic&#8208;like C2 symmetry, handedness control and extension by sticky ends to promote helix&#8208;helix associations.







Abstract
DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.

         <title>Electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CO on cadmium sulfide enhanced by chloride anion doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode exhibits good performance on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to selectively produce CO in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO can reach 98.1&#8201;% at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus Fc/Fc+ and a maximum jCO can be arrived 192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V versus Fc/Fc+ on Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO2 emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl&#8208;anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS&#8208;NF) using an in&#8197;situ hydrothermal method. The Cl&#8208;anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1&#8201;% on a Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc+ in this study). In particular, CO Faradaic efficiencies remained above 80&#8201;% in a wide potential range of &#8722;2.05&#8197;V to &#8722;2.45&#8197;V and a maximum partial current density (192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was achieved at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V. The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2, with appropriate Cl anions, displayed abundant active sites and a suitable electronic structure, resulting in outstanding ECR activity. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that Cl/CdS is beneficial for increasing the adsorption capacities of *COOH and *H, which can enhance the activity of the ECR toward CO and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Coupling of Alcohols: Efficient Routes to Access &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Substituted Chalcones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed approach provides &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from aryl&#8208;substituted secondary alcohols and benzyl alcohols via the borrowing hydrogen (BH) strategy in the presence of KOtBu, whereas exclusively &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones were accomplished in the presence of mild base K2CO3 through an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) strategy.







Abstract
Chemodivergent (de)hydrogenative coupling of primary and secondary alcohols is achieved utilizing an inexpensive nickel catalyst, (6&#8208;OH&#8208;bpy)NiCl2. This protocol demonstrates the synthesis of branched carbonyl compounds, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones, and &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones via borrowing hydrogen strategy and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling, respectively. A wide range of aryl&#8208;based secondary alcohols are coupled with various primary alcohols in this tandem dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reaction. The nickel catalyst, along with KOtBu or K2CO3, governed the selectivity for the formation of branched saturated ketones or chalcones. A preliminary mechanistic investigation confirms the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyls via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) and the involvement of radical intermediates during the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis and Modular Reactivity of Low Valent Al/Zn Heterobimetallics Supported by Common Monodentate Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and easy to access heterobimetallic system based on Al/Zn combinations is installed. Utilizing Cp*, HMDS and TMP ligands enables regioselective insertions of carbodiimides and ligand substitutions directly at the metal&#8208;metal bond. These transformations are accompanied by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Recent advances on low valent main group metal chemistry have shown the excellent potential of heterobimetallic complexes derived from Al(I) to promote cooperative small molecule activation processes. A signature feature of these complexes is the use of bulky chelating ligands which act as spectators providing kinetic stabilization to their highly reactive Al&#8722;M bonds. Here we report the synthesis of novel Al/Zn bimetallics prepared by the selective formal insertion of AlCp* into the Zn&#8722;N bond of the utility zinc amides ZnR2 (R=HMDS, hexamethyldisilazide; or TMP, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide). By systematically assessing the reactivity of the new [(R)(Cp*)AlZn(R)] bimetallics towards carbodiimides, structural and mechanistic insights have been gained on their ability to undergo insertion in their Zn&#8722;Al bond. Disclosing a ligand effect, when R=TMP, an isomerization process can be induced giving [(TMP)2AlZn(Cp*)] which displays a special reactivity towards carbodiimides and carbon dioxide involving both its Al&#8722;N bonds, leaving its Al&#8722;Zn bond untouched.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes was investigated. For reactions with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethylated imines either 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones or 2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydro&#8208;pyrimidines were obtained as major products, which are formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition pathway.

In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;lactam ring in classical &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics by an N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones or 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, via [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively. However, neither of these products was formed with imines derived from allyl glycinate and 2&#8208;(mono)methyl propionaldehydes. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethylation of the imine enabled the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway, but the desired 1,3&#8208;diazetidinone products were not observed. Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, via thiol displacement and re&#8208;addition to a putative six&#8208;membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations. In addition, we have shown that N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one products can be distinguished based on experimental IR data in combination with theoretical reference spectra employing the IR spectra alignment (IRSA) algorithm. This discrimination was not possible by means of 1H, 13C, or 15N&#8197;NMR spectroscopy

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes was investigated. For reactions with &#945;,&#945;-dimethylated imines either 2,3-dihydro-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,3,5-oxadiazin-4-ones or 2,4-dioxo-6-(aryl-/alkylthio)tetrahydro-pyrimidines were obtained as major products, which are formed &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a [4+2] cycloaddition pathway. In contrast, the formation of 1,3-diazetidinones &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; [2+2] cycloaddition was not observed. The different reaction outcomes were rationalized by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3-substituted &#946;-lactam ring in classical &#946;-lactam antibiotics by an N(3)-acyl-1,3-diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3-diazetidinones or 2,3-dihydro-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,3,5-oxadiazin-4-ones, &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively.

Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2-dimethyl 3-oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-6-(aryl-/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; thiol displacement and re-addition to a putative six-membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triflate's bigger brother: The unprecedented tribrate anion [Br3CSO3]&#8211; is flanked by its smaller siblings, the triflate and the trichlate anions. The new big brother was obtained by bromination of phenyl methane sulfonate with KOBr, followed by splitting of the ester under basic conditions. The new anion was studied through X&#8208;ray diffraction of its potassium salt. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition was investigated, and the Raman data of the anion are reported. The background image shows the church tower of the famous cathedral of Cologne, the place of birth for the new anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;S. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303617).

         <dc:description>
Using short hybrid peptide as a model, we examined the fluorine substitution effect and illustrated the power of small, yet robust &#8216;magical element&#8217; in controlling the conformation. The comparative study carried out on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs using SC&#8208;XRD, CD, and 2D&#8208;NMR studies provide valuable insights in fluorinated substrates&#8217; design as functional molecules.







Abstract
Fluorine, the tiny robust atom, with its unique features has captured the attention of scientists in recent times, especially in drug discovery with its integration in small molecules, peptides, and proteins. However, studies to understand the &#8216;fluorine effects&#8217; on the conformation of molecules that follow &#8216;beyond the rule of 5&#8217; are in the infancy yet significant in molecular design and function. For the first time, using short hybrid peptide sequence as an appropriate model, we examined the substitution effect (size, stereoelectronic effect, and hydrogen bonding) using X&#8208;ray diffraction, 2D&#8208;NMR, and CD studies. The comparative study on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs can provide valuable insights into fluorinated substrates&#8217; design.

         <title>Defect engineering on electrocatalysts for sustainable nitrate reduction to ammonia: Fundamentals and regulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect engineering holds tremendous potential for improving the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia through the precise modulation of the electronic and geometric structures of catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in defect engineering for nitrate reduction, while also highlighting promising unexplored avenues for further progress in this field.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) is a &#8220;two birds&#8208;one stone&#8221; method that targets remediation of NO3&#8722;&#8208;containing sewage and production of valuable NH3. The exploitation of advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and durability is a key issue for the efficient catalytic performance. Among various strategies for catalyst design, defect engineering has gained increasing attention due to its ability to modulate the electronic properties of electrocatalysts and optimize the adsorption energy of reactive species, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Despite previous progress, there remains a lack of mechanistic insights into the regulation of catalyst defects for NO3&#8722; reduction. Herein, this review presents insightful understanding of defect engineering for NO3&#8722; reduction, covering its background, definition, classification, construction, and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the relationships between regulation of catalyst defects and their catalytic activities are illustrated by investigating the properties of electrocatalysts through the analysis of electronic band structure, charge density distribution, and controllable adsorption energy. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives for future development of defects in NO3RR are also discussed, which can help researchers to better understand the defect engineering in catalysts, and also inspire scientists entering into this promising field.

         <title>Design Strategies toward High&#8208;Utilization Zinc Anodes for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This focused review summarizes the research status on developing high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries. Three major strategies in achieving high Zn utilization, including using ultrathin Zn foils, engineering Zn powder anodes, and designing substrates for Zn electrodeposition are systematically discussed. Future prospects for advancing the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries are proposed.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their low cost and high specific energy. However, the actual energy density falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the use of excessive Zn as anode and the associated issues including dendritic growth and side reactions. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective approach to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity or tuning the Zn anode utilization to achieve low N/P ratio batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.

         <title>Design Strategies towards Advanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bridge the gap between academia and industry for water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, in this review, design strategies from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are summarized for achieving highly active and robust large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2), produced by water electrolysis with the electricity from renewable sources, is an ideal energy carrier for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral and sustainable society. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic half&#8208;reaction of water electrolysis, which requires active and robust electrocatalysts to reduce the energy consumption for H2 generation. Despite numerous electrocatalysts have been reported by the academia for HER, most of them were only tested under relatively small current densities for a short period, which cannot meet the requirements for industrial water electrolysis. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, it is crucial to develop highly active HER electrocatalysts which can operate at large current densities for a long time. In this review, the mechanisms of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are firstly introduced. Then, design strategies towards high&#8208;performance large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER electrocatalysts from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are discussed via featured examples. Finally, our own insights about the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented.

         <title>Stabilization and One Electron Reduction of a Silicon Analogue of a Carboxylic Acid Anhydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation of two 1,2&#8208;disilylenes and two abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes with N2O lead to formation of the first uncoordinated silicon analogues of carboxylic acid anhydrides. Reaction of one with a dimagnesium&#8197;(I) compound proceeds via a one&#8208;electron reduction and formation of a magnesium sila&#8208;acid anhydride radical complexes.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylenes {(DipArAm)Si}2 (DipArAm=[(NDip)2CAr]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But (Ar&#8217;) 1&#8201;a or Ph 1&#8201;b) and two abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes, (DipArAm)SiOCSi{(NDip)2CAr} (Ar=Ar&#8217; 3&#8201;a or Ph 3&#8201;b) with N2O led to formation of unprecedented examples of uncoordinated silicon analogues of carboxylic acid anhydrides, (DipArAm)(O=)SiOSi(=O)(DipArAm) (Ar=Ar&#8217; 2&#8201;a or Ph 2&#8201;b). Both compounds have been fully characterized, and the mechanism of formation of one explored using DFT calculations. Reduction of sila&#8208;acid anhydride 2&#8201;a with a dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(MesNacnac)Mg}2] (MesNacnac=[(MesNCMe)2CH]&#8722;, Mes=mesityl), led to the one&#8208;electron reduction of the anhydride and formation of a magnesium complex of a sila&#8208;acid anhydride radical anion [(MesNacnac)Mg{(OSi(DipAr&#8217;Am)}2O] 5. A combination of EPR spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations reveal the unpaired electron to largely reside on one of the amidinate ligands of the complex.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High yielding heterocyclization of 1,3butadiyne bridged pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes led to a new series of chiral carbon&#8208;based macrocycles. Analysis of their (chir)optical properties revealed an increase in quantum yield along with noticeable circularly polarized luminescence activity. The experimental results are theoretically supported using density&#8208;functional theory.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules possessing high quantum yields, circular dichroism, and circularly polarized luminescence values have great potential as optically active materials for future applications. Recently, the identification of a promising class of inherently chiral compounds was reported, namely macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne&#8208;linked pseudo&#8208;meta[2.2]paracyclophanes, displaying high circular dichroism and related gabs values albeit modest quantum yields. Increasing the quantum yields in an attempt to get bright circularly polarized light emitters, the high&#8208;yielding heterocyclization of those 1,3&#8208;butadiyne bridges resulting in macrocyclic 2,5&#8208;thienyls&#8208;linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes is herein described. The chiroptical properties of both, the previously reported 1,3&#8208;butadiyne, and the novel 2,5&#8208;thienyl bridged macrocycles of various sizes, are experimentally recorded, and theoretically described using density&#8208;functional theory.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering in Co/VN Nanoparticles to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Aqueous/Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;support interactions is one of the potent tools for augmenting catalytic performance. Herein, highly active Co/VN nanoparticles are well dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanofoam (Co/VN@NC) with the assistance of dicyandiamide. Studies certify that the consequential disordered carbon substrate reinforces the confinement of electrons, while the coupling of diverse components optimizes charge redistribution among species. Besides, theoretical analyses confirm that the regulated electron configuration can significantly tune the binding strength between the active sites and intermediates,&#160;thus optimizing reaction energy barriers.&#160;Therefore, Co/VN@NC exhibits a competitive potential difference (&#916;E, 0.65 V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2 (0.67 V). Further, catalyst&#8208;based aqueous/flexible ZABs present superior performances with peak power densities of 156 and 85 mW cm&#8722;2, superior to Pt/C&#8208;based counterparts (128 and 73 mW cm&#8722;2). This research provides a pivotal foundation for the evolution of bifunctional catalysts in the energy sector.</dc:description>

         <title>Empowering Protein Engineering Through Recombination of Beneficial Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution stands as a seminal technology for generating novel protein functionalities, a cornerstone in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Today, with the development of various mutagenesis methods and advanced analytical machines, the challenge of diversity generation and high&#8208;throughput screening platforms is largely solved, and one of the remaining challenges is: how to empower the potential of single beneficial substitutions with recombination to achieve the epistatic effect. This review overviews experimental and computer&#8208;assisted recombination methods in protein engineering campaigns. In addition, integrated and machine learning&#8208;guided strategies were highlighted to discuss how these recombination approaches contribute to generating the screening library with better diversity, coverage, and size. A decision tree was finally summarized to guide the further selection of proper recombination strategies in practice, which was beneficial for accelerating protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>"The Sulfur Dance" Around Arenes and Heteroarenes &#8208; the Reversible Nature of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose the features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitutions in view of their significance and generality in dynamic aromatic chemistry. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#176;C, in a process that one may call a "sulfur dance&#8221;. These SNAr systems present their own features, apart from common reversible reactions utilized in dynamic chemistry (DCC). By varying conditions, covalent dynamics may operate to provide libraries of thiaarenes with some selectivity, or conversion of a hexa(thio)benzene asterisk into another one. The reversible nature of SNAr is confirmed by three methods: a convergence of the products distribution in reversible SNAr systems, a related product redistribution between two per(thio)benzenes by using a thiolate promoter, and from kinetic/thermodynamic data. A four&#8208;component dynamic covalent system further illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine by sulfur component exchanges. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr in aromatic chemistry and in DCC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To expand the market capacity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene (PDEB), core&#8208;shell zeolite (TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48) is designed as a catalyst for PDEB oxidation. TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 catalyst is synthesized by in&#8208;situ crystallization method and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption, in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS&#8208;NMR). Oxidation of PDEB by H2O2 was investigated systematically in liquid phase. The conversion of PDEB over TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 was 28.1% and the total selectivity was 72.6%, where the selectivity of EAP (p&#8208;ethylacetophenone) and EPEA (4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol) was 28.6% and 44.0%, respectively. Compared with TS&#8208;1 and MCM&#8208;48 zeolite, the conversion rate of reactants and the selectivity of products have been significantly improved. The catalytic performance of TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 is derived from its well&#8208;crystallized microporous core and mesoporous shell with regular channels, which make active sites of TS&#8208;1 zeolite in the catalyst be fully utilized and mass transfer resistance be largely reduced. Further through theoretical calculation, we propose that the oxidation of PDEB is the result of the combination and mutual transformation of free radical process and carbocation process. Core&#8208;shell structure ensures the conversion rate of raw materials and improves the selectivity of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Molecules Mimic Alkali Metals Enabling Spontaneous Harpoon Reactions with Halogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The harpoon mechanism has been a milestone in molecular reaction dynamics. Until now, the entity from which electron harpooning occurs has been either alkali metal atoms or non&#8208;metallic analogs in their excited states. In this work, we demonstrate that a common organic molecule, octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (omC4P), behaves just like alkali metal atoms, enabling the formation of charge&#8208;separated ionic bonding complexes with halogens omC4P+&#183;X&#8211; (X= F&#8211;I, SCN) via the harpoon mechanism. Their electronic structures and chemical bonding were determined by cryogenic photoelectron spectroscopy of the corresponding anions and confirmed by theoretical analyses. The omC4P+&#183;X&#8211; could be visualized to form from the reactants omC4P + X via electron harpooning from omC4P to X at a distance defined by the energy difference between the ionization potential of omC4P and electron affinity of X.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes via Dispersion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the generalized beneficial effect of naphthalene and its simple derivatives on energy&#8208;transfer reactions. Increased reactions rates and higher yields are achieved for several reactivities, varying substrates, solvents, light sources and photocatalysts. The consistent trend is observed using molar excess of naphthalene or a catalytic amount of tailored bi&#8208;naphthyl derivatives. These findings can be broadly used to improve existing methods as well as to shrink the efforts required to develop new ones.







Abstract
The generation of open&#8208;shell intermediates under mild conditions has opened broad synthetic opportunities during this century. However, these reactive species often require a case specific and tailored tuning of experimental parameters in order to efficiently convert substrates into products. We report a general approach that can overcome these ubiquitous limitations for several visible&#8208;light promoted energy&#8208;transfer processes. The use of either naphthalene (5&#8211;20&#8197;equiv.) or simple binaphthyl derivatives (10&#8211;30&#8197;mol&#8201;%) greatly increases their efficiency, giving rise to a new strategy for catalysis. The trend is consistent among different media, photocatalysts, light sources and substrates, allowing one to improve existing methods, to more easily optimize conditions for new ones, and, moreover, to disclose otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let there be rock! Like the hand of a guitarist moving all over the guitar neck when improvising a solo, the pillar[5]arene moiety of a rotaxane slides over the axle component with preferential positions and a substantial distortion. A complete understanding of such motions was achieved by detailed variable&#8208;temperature NMR investigations with the help of density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304131).

         <title>The Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic Enolates for the Construction of Quaternary and Tetrasubstituted Chiral Centres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To facilitate the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, the demand for novel stereofunctionalised building blocks has never been greater. Whilst molecules bearing quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres are ideally suited to explore untapped areas of chemical space, the asymmetric construction of&#8239;sterically congested carbon centres remains a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. The enantioselective assembly of acyclic stereogenic centres is even more demanding due to the need to restrict a much wider range of geometries and conformations of the intermediates involved. In this context, the catalytic asymmetric allylic&#8239;alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, has become an indispensable tool to access a range of linear&#8239;&#945;&#8208;quaternary and&#8239;&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbonyl compounds. However, unlike the AAA of cyclic enolates with a fixed enolate geometry, to achieve high levels of stereocontrol in the AAA of acyclic enolates, the stereoselectivity of enolisation must be considered. The aim of this review is to offer a&#8239;comprehensive&#8239;discussion of catalytic AAA reactions of acyclic prochiral enolates and their analogues to generate congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted chiral centres using metal, non&#8208;metal and dual catalysis, with particular focus given to the control of enolate geometry and its impact on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Role of BN&#8208;Embedding Position in B2N2&#8208;Perylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the BN&#8208;embedding position has been revealed through position isomerization of B2N2&#8208;perylenes. The shift in the BN position alters the &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, aromaticity, and molecular rigidness significantly, resulting in substantially higher electron transition abilities. The finding that the BN&#8208;embedding position dominates the photophysical properties over the BN orientation may help in the generation of future highly emissive BN&#8208;PAHs.







Abstract
Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2&#8208;perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2&#8208;perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane. It is further clarified that BN position dominates the photophysical properties over BN orientation. The revealed guideline here may apply generally to novel BN&#8208;PAHs, and aid the advancement of BN&#8208;PAHs with highly&#8208;emissive performance.

         <title>Shaping Chirality via Stereoselective, Organocatalytic [4+2] Cycloadditions involving Heterocyclic ortho&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping Chirality from Heterocyles. The mild, organocatalytic generation of elusive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediates (Het&#8208;oQDMs) from suitable heteroaromatic carbonyl&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;like pronucleophiles has recently proved to be succesful in the development of enantioselective [4+2] cycloadditions, giving access to novel, chiral heterocyclic chemotypes featuring in&#8208;cycle stereocenters. This review provides a critical analysis of the most important advances in the field achieved in the last decade.







Abstract
Polycyclic compounds bearing a complex heterocyclic core such as an aromatic heterocycle &#8220;fused&#8221; with one or more functionalized rings, are widespread leading molecules in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Although many synthetic methodologies have been devised to access achiral, fused heteroaromatic scaffolds, or related chiral variants adorned with out&#8208;of&#8208;cycle stereogenic elements, equally efficient strategies to afford chiral heterocycles featuring in&#8208;cycle stereocenters, exist to a lesser extent and presently represent a growing field of investigation. The mild, organocatalytic generation of elusive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediates (oQDMs), derived from suitable heteroaromatic carbonyl&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;like pronucleophiles has recently proved successful in the synthesis of such peculiar chiral architectures via stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions. This review provides an overview of the most important advances attained in this field over the last decade.

         <title>A Strategy Based on &#8220;Ambident Anthracene&#8221; for the Synthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Iptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes by using an &#8220;ambident anthracene&#8221; building block is presented. For this purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is currently the iptycene with the longest chain to have been synthesized. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303687).

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the N&#8208;Hydroxylations Catalyzed by the Binuclear Iron Domain of SznF Enzyme: Key Piece in the Synthesis of Streptozotocin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis: The consecutive hydroxylation mechanism of N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;NMA) catalyzed by SznF's di&#8208;iron domain is presented. Initiated by the peroxo&#8208;Fe2(III/III) intermediate, the reaction involves proton/electron (H+/e&#8722;) addition on either side of this intermediate facilitating the generation of N&#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;HMA) and N&#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#969;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8211;DHMA).







Abstract
SznF, a member of the emerging family of heme&#8208;oxygenase&#8208;like (HO&#8208;like) di&#8208;iron oxidases and oxygenases, employs two distinct domains to catalyze the conversion of N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;NMA) into N&#8208;nitroso&#8208;containing product, which can subsequently be transformed into streptozotocin. Using unrestricted density functional theory (UDFT) with the hybrid functional B3LYP, we have mechanistically investigated the two sequential hydroxylations of L&#8208;NMA catalyzed by SznF's binuclear iron central domain. Mechanism B primarily involves the O&#8722;O bond dissociation, forming Fe(IV)=O, induced by the H+/e&#8722; introduction to the FeA side of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;Fe2(III/III), the substrate hydrogen abstraction by Fe(IV)=O, and the hydroxyl rebound to the substrate N radical. The stochastic addition of H+/e&#8722; to the FeB side (mechanism C) can transition to mechanism B, thereby preventing enzyme deactivation. Two other competing mechanisms, involving the direct O&#8722;O bond dissociation (mechanism A) and the addition of H2O as a co&#8208;substrate (mechanism D), have been ruled out.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Production and Integrated Application of Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, MSCs have developed rapidly. This review focuses on the large&#8208;scale fabrication and diverse applications of MSCs, discusses the latest advances in electrode materials and micro&#8208;nano fabrication technologies, and gives an overview of MSCs applications in key areas. Finally, the challenges faced by MSCs research, the future development direction are given.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors, emerging as promising micro&#8208;energy storage devices, have attracted significant attention due to their unique features. This comprehensive review focuses on two key aspects: the scalable fabrication of MSCs and their diverse applications. The review begins by elucidating the energy storage mechanisms and guiding principles for designing high&#8208;performance devices. It subsequently explores recent advancements in scalable fabrication techniques for electrode materials and micro&#8208;nano fabrication technologies for micro&#8208;devices. The discussion encompasses critical application domains, including multifunctional MSCs, energy storage integration, integrated power generation, and integrated applications. Despite notable progress, there are still some challenges such as large&#8208;scale production of electrode material, well&#8208;controlled fabrication technology, and scalable integrated manufacture. The summary concludes by emphasizing the need for future research to enhance micro&#8208;supercapacitor performance, reduce production costs, achieve large&#8208;scale production, and explore synergies with other energy storage technologies. This collective effort aims to propel MSCs from laboratory innovation to market viability, providing robust energy storage solutions for MEMS and portable electronics.

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;responsive photosensitizers for selective imaging and photo&#8208;inactivation of intracellular bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;responsive photosensitizers ((T)CyI&#8722;NO2) were designed and synthesized. The quenched fluorescence and singlet oxygen production of (T)CyI&#8722;NO2 can be switched on by NTR in S. aureus. Detailed studies displayed TCyI&#8722;NO2 was able to selectively image and efficiently photo&#8208;inactivate intracellular bacteria with little cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), especially the methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are difficult to detect and eradicate due to the protection by the host cells. Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) offers promise in treating intracellular bacteria, provided that selective damage to the bacteria ranther than host cells can be realized. According to the different nitroreductase (NTR) levels in mammalian cells and S. aureus, herein NTR&#8208;responsive photosensitizers (PSs) (T)CyI&#8722;NO2 were designed and synthesized. The emission and 1O2 generation of (T)CyI&#8722;NO2 are quenched by the 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl group, but can be specifically switched on by bacterial NTR. Therefore, selective imaging and photo&#8208;inactivation of intracellular S. aureus and MRSA were achieved. Our findings may pave the way for the development of more efficient and selective aPDT agents to combat intractable intracellular infections.

         <title>Metal Influence on Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Aromaticity and Activation Strain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the metal fragment on the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction is computationally explored in detail. Whereas there is no impact on the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states, a significant influence on the barrier of the cycloaddition, particularly for germanium and magnesium complexes, is found.







Abstract
The factors governing 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions involving C&#8801;P&#8208;containing compounds are computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the parent process involving tBuN3 and tBuCP is analyzed and compared to the analogous reaction involving organometallic cyaphide complexes (metal=Au, Pt, Ge, Mg), in order to understand the role of the metal fragment in such transformations. It is found that while the metal fragment does not significantly influence the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states or the regioselectivity of the transformation, it may modify the reactivity of the cyaphide complexes (i.&#8201;e. Ge and Mg cyaphide complexes are comparatively more reactive). The computed reactivity trends and the factors behind the regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction are quantitatively analyzed with the help of the activation strain model in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.

A ferrocene reflects on the moon surface, illuminating a bridge between two gold metal centers. This imagery captures the use of bridging ligands in the synthesis of ferrocenyl gold(I) dinuclear complexes. Two dragons embody distinct bridging ligands and their consequential structures. The green dragon symbolizes the incorporation of chloride bridging ligands, its pointed gaze directed towards the corresponding molecular structure of the chloronium gold(I) complex. The yellow dragon represents the use of the pentafluorophenylthiolate ligand, visually joined to its intricate X&#8208;ray diffraction structure. These dynamic depictions underscore the pivotal role of these bridging ligands in influencing catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of a cyclization reaction, thus establishing a visually compelling narrative of the study focus and outcomes.

         <title>Toward Efficient and Stereoselective Aromatic and Dearomative Cope Rearrangements: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Aromatic &#947;&#8208;Lactone Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aromatic Cope rearrangement is an elusive transformation that has been the subject to limited number of investigations compared to those seemingly close analogues, namely the Cope and aromatic Claisen rearrangement. Herein we report our investigations inspired by moderate success observed in the course of pioneering works. By careful experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that key substitutions on 1,5&#8208;hexadiene scaffold allow fruitful transformations. Especially, efficient functionalisation of the heteroaromatic rings results from the aromatic Cope rearrangement, while highly stereoselective interrupted aromatic Cope rearrangements highlight the formation of chiral compounds through a dearomative process.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aromatic Cope rearrangement is an elusive transformation that has been the subject to limited number of investigations compared to those seemingly close analogues, namely the Cope and aromatic Claisen rearrangement. Herein we report our investigations inspired by moderate success observed in the course of pioneering works. By careful experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that key substitutions on 1,5-hexadiene scaffold allow fruitful transformations. Especially, efficient functionalisation of the heteroaromatic rings results from the aromatic Cope rearrangement, while highly stereoselective interrupted aromatic Cope rearrangements highlight the formation of chiral compounds through a dearomative process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Specified Coupling Reactions of Nitroarenes by Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth study on reduction&#8208;specified coupling reactions of the nitroarenes by heterogeneous cobalt catalysis opens a door for diversified syntheses of functional N&#8208;containing molecules. Guided by the structure&#8208;function relationship of heterogeneous materials, rational design of nano&#8208;catalysts can effectively regulate the routes of organic reactions. Precise transformation of the intermediates generated during the nitroarene reduction with a suitable nano&#8208;catalyst is a promising way to develop new tandem reactions, and to synthesize structurally novel compounds that are of difficult access with the conventional approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size: A Key Parameter in Modulating Carbonyl Compound Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exchanging oxygen in the functional group C=O (i.e., carbonyl) for the&#160;less electronegative Group 16 elements sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the electronegativity of the C=X group in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960; HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses revealed that the steric size of the chalcogen atom X is at the origin of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior. This tuning of the chemical properties of carbonyl compounds by varying the chalcogen atom size in the C=X bond can be applied in many fields of chemistry. This concept article delineates several useful applications in the fields of organocatalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and photo(electro)chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective modification of complex biomolecules by transition metal&#8208;catalysis is highly warranted, but often thwarted by the presence of Lewis basic functional groups. This study demonstrates that protonation of amines and phosphates in carbohydrates circumvents catalyst inhibition in palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation. Both aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates, compound classes that up till now largely escaped direct modification, are oxidized with good efficiency. Site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin was used to prepare a set of 3&#8217;&#8209;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two showed promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilised Ruthenium Complexes for the Electrooxidation of&#160;5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abundantly available biomass&#8208;based platform chemicals, including 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), are essential stepping stones in steering the chemical industry away from fossil fuels. The efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to its diacid derivative, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is a promising research area with potential applications in the polymer industry. Currently, the most encouraging approaches are based on solid&#8208;state catalysts and are often conducted in basic aqueous media, conditions where HMF oxidation competes with its decomposition. Efficient molecular catalysts are practically unknown for this reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalysis of surface&#8208;bound molecular ruthenium complexes for the transformation of HMF to FDCA under acidic conditions. Catalyst immobilisation on mesoporous indium tin oxide electrodes is achieved through the incorporation of phosphonic acid anchoring groups. Screening experiments with HMF and further reaction intermediates revealed the catalytic route and bottlenecks in the catalytic synthesis of FDCA. Utilising these immobilised electrocatalysts, FDCA yields of up to 85% and faradaic efficiencies of 91% were achieved, without any indication of substrate decomposition. Surface analysis by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) post&#8208;electrocatalysis unveiled the desorption of the catalyst from the electrode surface as a limiting factor in terms of catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With peptides increasingly favored as drugs, natural product motifs, namely the tryptathionine staple, found in amatoxins and phallotoxins, and the 2,2'&#8208;bis&#8208;indole found in staurosporine represent unexplored staples for unnatural peptide macrocycles. We disclose the efficient condensation of a 5&#8208;hydroxypyrroloindoline with either a cysteine&#8208;thiol or a tryptophan&#8208;indole to form a tryptathionine or 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole staple. Judicious use of protecting groups provides for chemoselective stapling using &#945;&#8208;MSH, which provides a basis for investigating both chemoselectivity and affinity.

         <title>Polymer Backbone Chemistry Shapes the Alkaline Stability of Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers have garnered significant attention in past years due to their potential role in sustainable and affordable energy conversion and storage. However, the chemical stability of the polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), the key component in these devices, currently limits their lifespan. Recently, metallopolymers have been proposed as chemically stable alternatives to organic cations, using metal centers as ion transporters. In metallopolymer AEMs, various properties such as alkaline stability, water uptake, flexibility, and performance, are determined by both the metal complex and polymer backbone. Herein we present a systematic study investigating the influence of the polymer backbone chemistry on some of these properties, focusing on the alkaline stability of low&#8208;oxophilicity gold metallopolymers. Despite the use of a common N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, upon gold metalation using the same reaction conditions, different polymer backbones end up forming different gold complexes. These findings suggest that polymer chemistry affects the metalation reaction in addition to the other properties relevant to AEM performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;Dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;Innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic properties of trinuclear complexes based on the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8722; is independent from both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions, when it is in the full semiquinone state. They are governed only by the electronic structure of HHTP3&#8722; that can be qualitatively inferred from the analysis of the X&#8208;ray structure of the related complexes.







Abstract
A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8722;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8722; couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8722; turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work azotriptycenes are presented as light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. Their mechanism of motion and changed kinetics upon isomerization are studied by theory and variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8722;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.

         <title>B&#8208;P Coupling: Metal Stabilized Phosphinoborate Complexes</title>

Synthesis and characterization of phosphinoborate complex through B&#8208;P coupling reaction involving Ru&#8208;(&#963;&#8208;borate) species and chlorodiphenyl phosphine.







Abstract
In an effort to establish B&#8208;P coupling reactions without the use of phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling agent, we have developed a new synthetic methodology employing group&#8197;8 metal &#963;&#8208;borate complex [{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;BH2L2}Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH3L}] (L=NC5H4S), 1. Treatment of 1 with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh2Cl) yielded 1,5&#8208;P,S chelated Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate species [PPh2H{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH(OH)L}Ru{&#954;2&#8208;P,S&#8208;(Ph2P)BH2L}], 2. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh2) by the cleavage of 3c&#8211;2e &#963;(Ru&#8230;H&#8208;B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B&#8208;P bond. The &#954;2&#8208;P,S chelated six&#8208;membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex 2. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B&#8208;P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B&#8208;P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of 1 and Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complex, 5 with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of 1 with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &#963;&#8208;borate complex 3, the similar reaction of 5 at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 6. In a similar fashion, the reaction of 5 with phosphite ligand generated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 7, which is analogous to 6.

         <title>Unravelling CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates on High Entropy Alloy Catalysts: An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach to Establish Scaling Relations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a proposed interpretable machine learning model successfully established a scaling relation among the adsorbates adsorbed on the same adsorption sites of the complex high entropy alloy catalytic surfaces through suitable features and techniques.







Abstract
Establishment of a scaling relation among the reaction intermediates is highly important but very much challenging on complex surfaces, such as surfaces of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Herein, we designed an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to establish a scaling relation among CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorbed at the same adsorption site. Local Interpretable Model&#8208;Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are used for the global and local interpretation of the utilized black box models. These methods were successfully applied through an iterative way and validated on CuCoNiZnMg and CuCoNiZnSnbased HEAs data. Finally, we successfully predicted adsorption energies of *H2CO (MAE: 0.24&#8197;eV) and *H3CO (MAE: 0.23&#8197;eV) by using the *HCO training data. Similarly, adsorption energy of *O (MAE: 0.32&#8197;eV) is also predicted from *H training data. We believe that our proposed method can shift the paradigm of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML in catalysis towards better interpretability.

         <title>An Investigation of Allyl&#8208;Substituted Bis(Diphosphine) Iron Complexes: Towards Precursors for Cooperative CO2 Activation</title>

In the development of homogenous catalysts capable of selective CO2 reduction, factors that impact CO2 coordination mode and downstream reactivity are of interest. This work presents the synthesis of novel Fe compounds bearing unsaturated diphosphine ligands, their reactivity with CO2, and a theoretical exploration of cooperative CO2 activation using a boron&#8208;rich secondary coordination sphere.







Abstract
In developing homogenous catalysts capable of CO2 activation, interaction with a metal center is often imperative. This work provides primary efforts towards the cooperative activation of CO2 using a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and iron via a paired theoretical/experimental approach. Specifically, this study reports efforts towards [Fe(diphosphine)2(N2)] as a CO2&#8208;coordinated synthon where diphosphine=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;cyclohexylboranyl)propylphosphino)ethane) (P2BCy4) or its precursor, 1,2&#8208;bis(diallylphosphino)ethane (tape). Initial efforts toward the {Fe(0)&#8208;N2} complex were focused on deprotonation reactions of [Fe(diphosphine)2(H)(NCCH3)]+ and reduction of [Fe(tape)2Cl2]. In the latter case, a mixture of intramolecularly &#960;&#8208;bonded alkene and associated metallacyclic Fe(II)&#8212;H species were produced &#8211; heating this mixture provided the hydride as the major product. Notably, the interconversion of this pair counters that of related intermolecular reactions between [Fe(depe)2] (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) and ethylene, where hydride formation occurs subsequent to &#960;&#8208;coordination; this has been probed by theoretical calculations. Finally, reactivity of the metallacyclic {Fe(II)&#8212;H} complex with CO2 was probed, resulting in a pair of isomeric ferra(II)lactones.

Starfruit&#8208;shaped Zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (SMOF), with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals, can form spontaneously from the transformation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOF crystals in a solvothermal synthesis. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts.







Abstract
We present the fabrication of a novel Starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and Tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers. The SMOF exhibits a unique morphology with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals. Our investigation unravels a captivating transformation process, wherein three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shuttle&#8208;shaped MOFs form initially and subsequently evolve into 2D nanosheet&#8208;based SMOF structures. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. This discovery of the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transition growth pathway unlocks exciting opportunities for exploring novel strategies in advanced MOF nanostructure development, not only for catalysis but also for various other applications.

         <title>10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Fast charging: 10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;level TiNb2O7 secondary particle consisting of initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;m TiNb2O7 active particle with high crystallinity was successfully fabricated. The small number of particle&#8208;stacking layers with high conductivity could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance within the electrode, which enabled the outstanding fast&#8208;charging performance of 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level full cells.







Abstract
TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8211;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, the commercial high&#8208;rate anode material, and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Herein, 10&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7) was fabricated. The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast&#8208;charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possess and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance. The SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 exhibited high reversible capacity of 292.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the potential range of 1&#8211;3&#8197;V (Li+/Li) at 0.1&#8197;C, delivering high&#8208;capacity release of 94.3&#8201;%, and high capacity retention of 86&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C for 250&#8197;cycles in half cell configuration. Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08&#8197;Ah at high charging rate of 6&#8197;C (77.9&#8201;% of that at 0.2&#8197;C of 6.52&#8197;Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352&#8201;% for 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, suggesting the great potential for practical fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biphenyl&#8208;Bridged &#1013;&#8208;Sultams by Organocatalytic Mannich Reactions of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines with Unactivated Ketones</title>

Biphenyl&#8208;bridged &#1013;&#8208;sultams with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic Mannich reactions of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with unactivated methyl alkyl ketones. Unactivated ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates will gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis by using a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co&#8208;catalyst. High yields (up to 89&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favored at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl-bridged seven-membered cyclic N-sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis by using a quinine-derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co-catalyst. High yields (up to 89&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favored at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Novel Redox&#8208;Active Organic Materials Based on Benzimidazole, Benzoxazole, and Benzothiazole: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining theory and experiment allows the screening of new active materials. Electrochemical properties of the redox moieties can be predicted accurately. Out of three classes of molecule (benzo&#8208;thiazole, &#8208;oxazole, &#8208;imidazole), benzoxazoles exhibit the best electrochemical properties and can be further introduced into or onto a polymeric backbone, with the aim of being used in organic polymer batteries.







Abstract
Sustainability is one of the hot topics of today's research, in particular when it comes to energy&#8208;storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target molecules were identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical characterization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and used in organic polymer batteries.

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>

Lithium chloride is a decisive factor in converting heptazine&#8208;based Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 into triazine&#8208;based PTI, thereby leads to a drastic change in physicochemical properties and achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI) generally obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we demonstrate the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks. Additionally, the PTI exhibits higher photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation, as well as faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding of the polycondensation process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.

         <title>Access to NHC&#8211;Boryl Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Selenide and Utility as Mild Selenium Transfer Reagent Including to the C&#8722;F Bond</title>

Access to NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;boryl mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenides from NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 has been achieved. The boryl mono selenide has been demonstrated to function as a selenium transfer reagent, enabling the synthesis of selenoethers from benzyl bromide. Additionally, it can also facilitate the conversion of the challenging aromatic C&#8722;F bond to a C&#8722;Se bond, resulting in concomitant ring expansion of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;haloborane.







Abstract
Reactions of 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (5&#8208;SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) (1) with diphenyldiselenide provide access to 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8211;boryl mono&#8208; (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2SePh) (2) and bis&#8208;selenide (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH(SePh)2) (3). The facile cleavage of the B&#8722;Se bond makes 2 a neutral source of selenium nucleophiles in substitutions reactions with benzyl bromides, and provide access to the corresponding selenoethers. The direct transformations of one of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds of C5F5N and C6F5CF3 to C&#8722;Se bonds have also been achieved by the use of 2 without employing transition&#8208;metal catalysts. While it was previously established that C6F6 could undergo complete defluoroselenation under harsh conditions, we successfully achieved partial defluorination of C6F6 by employing 2 as a mild selenide transfer reagent. During the formation of C&#8722;Se bonds through the cleavage of C&#8722;F bonds, the potential by&#8208;product NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2F undergoes ring expansion of the NHC, leading to the formation of the six&#8208;membered diaazafluoroborinane (7).

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8722;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>

An electrochemical oxidative method for forming C&#8722;S bonds at the C3 position in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones using sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate has been developed. This method does not require any of the additional reagents or hazardous solvents, such as supporting electrolytes, HFIP, additives, or catalysts.







Abstract
An electrooxidative C&#8722;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. This work demonstrates that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8722;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8722;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) denoted as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) immobilized within the pores of g&#8208;C3N4 was designed by density functional theory computations, aiming to explore the nitrogen fixation activity of the Fe&#8722;Mo center and the influence of the coordination environment.







Abstract
Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8722;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8722;aXa DACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11&#8197;V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1&#8242;s high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.

         <title>Cyclic Azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic hybrids of azobenzene and BODIPY 2B&#8211;8B were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction and following BF2 insertion. The structures of the representative hybrids were unambiguously revealed by single crystal diffraction analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation, and ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays depend upon the ring size and connectivity.







Abstract
Cyclic azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY hybrids were synthesized via cyclization by 1) acid&#8208;catalysed condensation of azobenzene&#8208;bridged dipyrroles with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzaldehyde, 2) oxidation with DDQ, and 3) metalation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. The structures of many cyclic hybrids have been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation. The ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays of these cyclic hybrids depend upon the ring size and connectivity.

         <title>Remarkable Off&#8211;On Tunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by the Regulation of Pyrene Dimer</title>

Reversible &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent material: The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive due to the ordered and long&#8208;range &#960; stacking. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed owing to the formation of pyrene dimer structure. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material.







Abstract
It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in&#8208;depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Reductive Metallation of Dendralenes and Myrcene Using Dimagnesium(I) Compounds: A Facile Route to Unsaturated Organomagnesium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing dendralenes: The reduction of [4]dendralene and related substituted butadienes with dimagnesium(I) compounds has given a series of unsaturated organo&#8208;magnesium complexes (see picture, L=bulky N,N&#8208;chelating amide). Reaction of two of these with H2 and/or CO leads to the assembly of the substrates, affording value&#8208;added organic products.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron reduction of 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (DMB) with &#946;&#8208;diketiminate and guanidinate substituted dimagnesium(I) compounds has given complexes in which two bidentate amido&#8208;magnesium fragments are bridged through the &#960;&#8208;system of the DMB dianion, viz. [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] (L=XylNacnac, [HC(MeCNXyl)2]&#8722;, Xyl=2,6&#8208;xylyl; or Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Similar double reductions of [4]dendralene (4dend) have afforded the complexes, [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (L=ArNacnac, Ar=Xyl or mesityl (Mes); or Priso) in which the 4dend dianion is &#960;&#8208;coordinated to the bidentate amido&#8208;magnesium fragments. Treatment of several such complexes with THF leads to Z&#8208; to E&#8208;isomerization of the dendralene fragment, and formation of purely &#963;&#8208;bonded Mg&#8722;C interactions in the THF coordinated products [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (Ar=Xyl, Mes or Dip). Reaction of myrcene (Myr) with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] proceeds via reductive coupling of Myr to give a previously unknown acyclic, branched C20 tetra&#8208;olefin dianion complex [{(XylNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;Myr)2]. Preliminary reactions of [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] with H2 and/or CO yielded a series of products, including novel magnesium hydride compounds, products derived from couplings of CO with the reduced DMB fragment (viz. magnesium dimethylcyclohexadienediolates), and one magnesium cyclopropanetriolate complex from the magnesium(I) induced coupling of DMB with H2 and CO.

Similar double reductions of [4]dendralene (4dend) have afforded the complexes, [(LMg)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-4dend)] (L=&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac, Ar=Xyl or mesityl (Mes); or Priso) in which the 4dend dianion is &#960;-coordinated to the bidentate amido-magnesium fragments. Treatment of several such complexes with THF leads to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;- to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-isomerization of the dendralene fragment, and formation of purely &#963;-bonded Mg&#8722;C interactions in the THF coordinated products [{(&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)(THF)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-4dend)] (Ar=Xyl, Mes or Dip). Reaction of myrcene (Myr) with [{(&lt;sup&gt;Xyl&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] proceeds &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; reductive coupling of Myr to give a previously unknown acyclic, branched C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; tetra-olefin dianion complex [{(&lt;sup&gt;Xyl&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)(THF)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-Myr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Preliminary reactions of [(LMg)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-DMB)] with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or CO yielded a series of products, including novel magnesium hydride compounds, products derived from couplings of CO with the reduced DMB fragment (&lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. magnesium dimethylcyclohexadienediolates), and one magnesium cyclopropanetriolate complex from the magnesium(I) induced coupling of DMB with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diversification of Simple Arenes into Complex (Amino)cyclitols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic approach for accessing complex natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes. A key feature includes the application of a dearomative functionalization with arenophiles and subsequent diversification, generating a widespread library of compounds spanning far into underexplored chemical space.







Abstract
Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. This work reports the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.

         <title>Rebound or Cage Escape? The Role of the Rebound Barrier for the Reactivity of Non&#8208;Heme High&#8208;Valent FeIV=O Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of ligand design to modulate rebound barriers in order to achieve efficient and selective hydroxylation reactions with high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species is revealed.







Abstract
Owing to their high reactivity and selectivity, variations in the spin ground state and a range of possible pathways, high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species are popular models with potential bioinspired applications. An interesting example of a structure&#8211;reactivity pattern is the detailed study with five nonheme amine&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand FeIV=O species, including N4py: [(L1)FeIV=O]2+ (1), bntpen: [(L2)FeIV=O]2+ (2), py2tacn: [(L3)FeIV=O]2+ (3), and two isomeric bispidine derivatives: [(L4)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and [(L5)FeIV=O]2+ (5). In this set, the order of increasing reactivity in the hydroxylation of cyclohexane differs from that with cyclohexadiene as substrate. A comprehensive DFT, ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) study is presented to untangle the observed patterns. These are well reproduced when both activation barriers for the C&#8722;H abstraction and the OH rebound are taken into account. An MO, NBO and deformation energy analysis reveals the importance of &#960;(pyr) &#8594; &#960;*xz(FeIII&#8208;OH) electron donation for weakening the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and thus reducing the rebound barrier. This requires that pyridine rings are oriented perpendicularly to the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and this is a subtle but crucial point in ligand design for non&#8208;heme iron alkane hydroxylation.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of O&#8208;Benzoylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;mediated electrophilic amination methodology has been developed to provide access to a range of structurally diverse N&#8722;CF3 amines in good to moderate yields. The method proceeds under mild reaction conditions utilizing inexpensive reagents in an operationally simple manner.







Abstract
The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C&#8722;CF3 and O&#8722;CF3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N&#8722;CF3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N&#8722;CF3 containing compounds.

         <dc:description>
Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of methyl heteroarenes employing one single air, moisture stable and cost effective Mn(II) bridge complex has been demonstrated. Seven different types of heteroarenes are functionalized using various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Catalytic activities of Mn(I) complexes derived from expensive MnBr(CO)5 salt have been explored in various dehydrogenative transformations. However, the reactivity and selectivity of inexpensive high spin Mn(II) complexes are uncommon. Herein, we have synthesized four new Mn(II) complexes and explored switchable alkenylation and alkylation of methyl heteroarenes employing a single Mn(II)catalyst. The developed protocol selectively furnishes a series of functionalized E&#8208;heteroarenes and C&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes with good to excellent yields. Various medicinally and synthetically useful compounds are successfully synthesized using our developed protocol. Various controls and kinetics experiments were executed to shed light on the mechaism,which reveals that &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond breaking of alcohol is the slowest step.

         <title>Conformational Studies of &#946;&#8208;Azapeptoid Foldamers: A New Class of Peptidomimetics with Confined Dihedrals</title>

Novel &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids with confined backbone dihedrals were synthesized. These molecules adopted trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) with their &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions confined in narrow ranges (170&#8211;180&#176;). Their &#981;(C&#946;&#8208;N) can also be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the &#946;&#8208;carbon, which provide control over their backbone dihedrals.







Abstract
Controlling amide bond geometries and the secondary structures of &#946;&#8208;peptoids is a challenging task as they contain several rotatable single bonds in their backbone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and conformational properties of novel &#8220;&#946;&#8208;azapeptoids&#8221; with confined dihedrals. We discuss how the acylhydrazide sidechains in these molecules enforce trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) via steric and stereoelectronic effects. We also show that the &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids occupy a narrow range (170&#8211;180&#176;) that can be rationalized by the staggered conformational preference of the backbone methylene carbons and a novel backbone nO&#8594;&#963;*C&#946;&#8208;N interaction discovered in this study. However, the &#981; (C&#946;&#8208;N) torsion remains freely rotatable and, depending on &#981;, the sidechains can be parallel, perpendicular, and anti&#8208;parallel relative to each other. In fact, we observed parallel and perpendicular relative orientations of sidechains in the crystal geometries of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoid dimers. We show that &#981; of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids can be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the backbone &#946;&#8208;carbon, which could provide complete control over all the backbone dihedrals. Finally, we show that the &#981; and &#936; dihedrals of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids resemble that of a PPII helix and they retain PPII structure when incorporated in Host&#8211;guest proline peptides.

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>

2,4&#8208;Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was used as starting material to obtain functional and desymmetrized supramolecular monomers that assemble into fibrous structures in water. The resulting supramolecular polymers are dynamic, biocompatible and stable in cellular media, which opens up the use of the UT motif to access tunable biomaterials.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8211;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.

         <title>Intramolecular Carboxyamidation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered O&#8208;Acylhydroxamates through Formation of Fe(III)&#8208;Nitrenoids</title>

Zip and shift: The intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration can generate a wide variety of N,O&#8208;containing heterocycles. DFT study suggests the Fe&#8208;nitrenoid intermediate preferentially reacts in a radical manifold to mediates a stepwise C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O bond formation rather than a concerted [3+2] cycloaddition mechanism.







Abstract
We developed intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by either thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration. Under iron&#8208;catalyzed conditions, the carboxyamidation products were generated in high yield from both Z&#8208;alkene and arene&#8208;tethered substrates. DFT calculations indicate that the iron&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation proceeds via a stepwise mechanism involving iron&#8208;imidyl radical cyclization followed by intramolecular acyloxy transfer from the iron center to the alkenyl radical center to furnish the cis&#8208;carboxyamidation product. Upon treatment with 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, the Z&#8208;alkene&#8208;tethered carboxyamidation products underwent selective O&#8594;O acyl migration to generate 2&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;5&#8208;acyl pyrroles. Thermal O&#8594;N acyl migration occurs during carboxyamidation if the Z&#8208;alkene linker contains an alkyl or an aryl substituent at the &#946;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, the arene linker&#8208;containing compounds selectively undergo O&#8594;N acyl migration to generate N&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;acylisoindolinones, and the corresponding O&#8594;O acyl migration forming isoindole derivatives was not observed.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Starbons&#174;: Methodology Development and Carbon Dioxide Capture Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>

Nitrogen doping: Glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide are used as sustainable nitrogen sources in the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174;. Doping using microwave heating more effectively incorporates nitrogen than thermal heating in vacuo. The nitrogen&#8208;doped materials have superior carbon dioxide adsorption capacities and enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen selectivities compared to undoped Starbon&#174;.







Abstract
Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch. The materials are initially produced at 250&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C (SNx300y), then heated in vacuo to 800&#8201;&#176;C to produce nitrogen&#8208;doped SNx800y&#8217;s. Melamine gives the highest nitrogen incorporation without destroying the Starbon&#174; pore structure and the microwave heating methods give higher nitrogen incorporations than thermal heating. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; determined gravimetrically, in many cases exceed those of S300 and S800. The carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane adsorption isotherms of the most promising materials are measured volumetrically. Most of the nitrogen&#8208;doped materials show higher carbon dioxide adsorption capacities than S800, but lower methane and nitrogen adsorption capacities. As a result, the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; exhibit significantly enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen and methane versus nitrogen selectivities compared to S800.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free and Operationally Simple Radical Trifluoromethylative Borylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol has been developed to generate a trifluoromethyl and boron centered radical under metal&#8208;free conditions by the synergetic interaction of highly Lewis acidic boron reagent with Togni reagent. This method establishes a new approach for the installation of trifluoromethyl and boron moiety to the unactivated alkenes simultaneously.







Abstract
We herein describe a protocol to synthesize trifluoromethylated alkyl boronates from alkenes by the mutual activation of the Togni II and the bis(catecholato)diboron reagents in the absence of any catalyst and additives. This reaction enables synthesizing a series of trifluoromethylated alkyl boronates using unactivated alkenes, including natural products and drug derivatives, in a regioselective manner. Moreover, the synthetic utility of the boronic ester present in the product allows access to a range of trifluoromethyl containing compounds. The radical trapping and gas detection experiments reveal that the more Lewis acidic diboron reagent determines the rapid formation of trifluoromethyl and boron centered radicals.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Supported Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported Ionic Liquid Phase catalysts combine advantages from homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Control of the catalyst position in the IL film will boost their performance. Four ionic liquids are presented with NHC ligands deposited on SBA&#8208;15. Solid&#8208;state NMR and MD simulations yield a full model of the IL self&#8208;assembled monolayer.







Abstract
Separation and reuse of the catalytically active metal complexes are persistent issues in homogeneous catalysis. Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) catalysts, where the catalytic center is dissolved in a thin film of a stable ionic liquid, deposited on a solid support, present a promising alternative. However, the dissolution of the metal center in the film leaves little control over its position and its activity. We present here four novel, task&#8208;specific ionic liquids [FPhnImHR]I (n=1, 2; R=PEG2, C12H25), designed to self&#8208;assemble on a silica surface without any covalent bonding and offering a metal binding site in a controlled distance to the support. Advanced multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic techniques under Magic Angle Spinning, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to determine their molecular conformation when deposited inside SBA&#8208;15 as a model silica support. We provide here conceptual proof for a rational design of ionic liquids self&#8208;assembling into thin films, opening an avenue for a second, improved generation of SILP catalysts.

A novel starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers has been fabricated. The unique morphology of the SMOF, characterized by 2D nanosheet petals grown through edge&#8208;sharing, arises from 3D PCN&#8208;222 MOF intermediates. The distinct morphology of the SMOF leads to superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8208;a. Tao, J. Wang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302835).

         <title>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes: Strategies for Syntheses of Configurationally Stable, Electronically and Sterically Tunable Ambiphiles with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic strategies to the rigid, multiple reactive, tunable and versatile applicable title compounds are reviewed, including various o&#8208;metalation procedures followed by direct P&#8722;C coupling or phospho&#8208;Fries rearrangements, UV&#8208; or transition&#8208;metal mediated couplings, addition reactions of PH&#8208;reactants at quinones or intermediate arynes, and thermal or photo&#8208;induced decomposition of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.







Abstract
o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes are fascinating compounds by their multiple&#8208;reactivity features, attributed to the ambident hard and soft Lewis&#8208; and also Br&#248;nstedt acid&#8208;base properties, wide tuning opportunities via backbone substituents with &#177;mesomeric and inductive, at P and in o&#8208;position to P and O also steric effects, and in addition, the configurational stability at three&#8208;valent phosphorus. Air sensitivity may be overcome by reversible protection with BH3, but the easy oxidation to P(V)&#8208;compounds may also be used. Since the first reports on the title compounds ca. 50&#8197;years ago the multiple reactivity has led to versatile applications. This includes various P&#8722;E&#8722;O and P=C&#8722;O heterocycles, a multitude of O&#8208;substituted derivatives including acyl derivatives for traceless Staudinger couplings of biomolecules with labels or functional substituents, phosphane&#8208;phosphite ligands, which like the o&#8208;phosphanylphenols itself form a range of transition metal complexes and catalysts. Also main group metal complexes and (bi)arylphosphonium&#8208;organocatalysts are derived. Within this review the various strategies for the access of the starting materials are illuminated, including few hints to selected applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cutting&#8208;Edge Materials for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Water Harvesting from Air</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 6, January 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exemplify up&#8208;and&#8208;coming crystalline porous materials characterized by spectacular specific surface areas, adjustable pore environments, and superb physicochemical stabilities. This Review highlights the enormous potential and recent advances of COFs for carbon dioxide trapping and water harvesting from air, in addition to highlighting the key challenges and future research directions.







Abstract
The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Symmetrically Substituted Poly(3,4&#8208;Dimethylthiophene) as Cathode for Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggravation of energy problems and the scarcity of lithium resources have forced us to look for new energy storage systems. Aluminum ion batteries, as a promising energy storage system, has the advantages of environmental friendliness and abundant aluminum resources, and has the potential for application in large&#8208;scale energy storage and personal portable electronic devices. To solve the stability problem of aluminum ion batteries during cycling for large&#8208;scale energy storage needs, we report a polythiophene&#8208;based conductive polymer, poly(3,4&#8208;dimethylthiophene) (PDMT), as a high performance cathode material for aluminum ion batteries. By introducing two methyl groups on the thiophene ring, we successfully adjust the local charge density of the heterocyclic thiophene, thus changing the electron delocalization characteristics, and improving the electrochemical reaction activity of the polythiophene (PTH) material as a redox electrode material. This also maintains the symmetry and regularity of the polymer structure, giving the material better cycling stability. The discharge specific capacity reaches 110 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 200 mA g&#8208;1, far exceeding conventional PTH cathodes (~ 70 mAh g&#8208;1), and the capacity retention rate is 92.7% after 1000 cycles. It also shows excellent rate performance due to the flexible structure of the conductive polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Covalent&#8208;Disassembly&#8221;&#8208;Based Approaches For Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept outlines the &#8220;Covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8220; approach for analyte detection with metal&#8208;complexes in&#8197;vitro, foodstuff and living cells. Design principles for developing new probes for challenging targets as well as for improving current systems are summarized.







Abstract
The detection of analytes with small molecular probes is crucial for the analysis and understanding of chemical, medicinal, environmental and biological situations as well as processes. Classic detection approaches rely on the concept of molecular recognition and bond formation reactions. Bond breakage reactions have been less explored in similar contexts. This concept article introduces metal&#8208;salen and metal&#8208;imine complexes as &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221;&#8208;based (DB)&#8208;probes for detecting polyoxophosphates, thiols, amino acids, HCN and changes in pH. It discusses the roles, importance and combinations of structurally functionalized molecular building blocks in the construction of DB&#8208;probes. Applications of optimized DB&#8208;probes for analyte detection in live cells and foodstuff are also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanism of the disassembly of a Fe(III)&#8208;salen probe upon pyrophosphate binding is presented. Extraordinary selectivity for this analyte was achieved by a multistep disassembly sequence including an unprecedented structural change of the metal complex (i.&#8201;e. &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; principle). Design principles of probes for sensing applications following the &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221; approach are summarized, which will help improving current systems, but will also facilitate the development of new DB&#8208;probes for challenging analytic targets.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Efficiency of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase through the Synergy of Tunnel Engineering, Evolutionary Analysis, and Force&#8208;Field Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach combining tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force field calculations was used to enhance D&#8208;Lac activity, which revealed that distal residues on the critical loop at the entrance of the substrate tunnel may become a new modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and thereby affecting enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Computational design advances enzyme evolution and their use in biocatalysis in a faster and more efficient manner. In this study, a synergistic approach integrating tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force&#8208;field calculations has been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase (D&#8208;Lac), which is a pivotal enzyme involved in the resolution of racemic pantolactone during the production of vitamin B5. The best mutant, N96S/A271E/F274Y/F308G (M3), was obtained and its catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) was nearly 23&#8208;fold higher than that of the wild&#8208;type. The M3 whole&#8208;cell converted 20&#8201;% of DL&#8208;pantolactone into D&#8208;pantoic acid (D&#8208;PA, &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;e.e.) with a conversion rate of 47&#8201;% and space&#8208;time yield of 107.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, demonstrating its great potential for industrial&#8208;scale D&#8208;pantothenic acid production. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the reduction in the steric hindrance within the substrate tunnel and conformational reconstruction of the distal loop resulted in a more favourable&#8220;catalytic&#8221; conformation, making it easier for the substrate and enzyme to enter their pre&#8208;reaction state. This study illustrates the potential of the distal residue on the pivotal loop at the entrance of the D&#8208;Lac substrate tunnel as a novel modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and consequently influencing the enzymatic activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Interlocked and Non&#8208;Interlocked Deca(para&#8208;phenylene) Derivatives by Ni&#8208;mediated Biaryl Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2]Rotaxane with deca(para&#8208;phenylene) structure was synthesized in high yield under mild conditions by biaryl coupling mediated by a macrocyclic nickel complex. Deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane was readily soluble, and the optical properties of the compounds were examined in solution.







Abstract
Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a compound composed of directly connected 1,4&#8208;phenylene moieties. The synthesis of PPn composed of six or more phenylene moieties with no substituent at the internal phenylene moiety has been challenging because of its low solubility. Herein we synthesized oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes, including a deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane, with a defined number of phenylene moieties. Biaryl coupling of iodoarenes mediated by macrocyclic dibenzodihydrophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex was utilized for the first time to synthesize the [2]rotaxanes. Compared to the non&#8208;interlocked deca(para&#8208;phenylene), the deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane showed higher solubility. The properties of the oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes and non&#8208;interlocked oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)s were analyzed by spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Characterization by Gel Permeation Chromatography of the Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers Generated by Forming Polyrotaxanes through the Introduction of External Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of large stoppers to supramolecular polymers, followed by the spontaneous generation of dynamic covalent bonds leads to the transformation of supramolecular polymers into polyrotaxanes. Determining the molecular weight of the polyrotaxanes by gel permeation chromatography allows the molecular weight of the corresponding supramolecular polymers to be obtained.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers find wide applications across diverse domains, and the molecular weight exerts a critical influence on their applicability. Consequently, the measurement of molecular weight for supramolecular polymers assumes paramount significance. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) requiring low&#8208;concentration condition is a common characterization employed for molecular weight determination, which is not suitable for supramolecular polymers possessing concentration&#8208;independence property. Here, to break this threshold, we synthesized M1 embodying dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moiety as well as dibenzylammonium salt (DBA) group, which was capable of self&#8208;assembling into supramolecular polymers terminated with aldehyde groups at its end. Upon the addition of (4&#8208; (1,2,2&#8208;Triphenylvinyl) phenyl) methylamine (TPE&#8208;NH2), supramolecular polymers underwent a transition into polyrotaxanes, for which it was led by the generation of imine bonds. By virtue of GPC, the molecular weight of polyrotaxanes was obtained, then it was available to gain the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers with the help of transformation efficiency.

TOC sentence: A rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emission at long wavelengths is proposed. An intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;based 2&#8208;pyridone fluorophore with large molar absorptivity (&#1013;=20,100&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em=539&#8197;nm), high emission quantum yield (&#981;F=74&#8201;%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v=5720&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is developed by the strategy.







Abstract
The recent discovery of blue fluorophores with high quantum yields based on pyridone structures inspired the development of new low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluorophores with bright emissions at tunable wavelengths, which are highly attractive for various applications. In this study, we propose a rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emissions at long wavelengths. With a detailed understanding of the positional substitution effects on each carbon atom of the 2&#8208;pyridone core, we developed a bright blue fluorophore (&#955;abs=377&#8197;nm; &#955;em=433&#8197;nm; &#1013;=13,200&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1; &#981;F=88&#8201;%) through C3&#8208;aryl and C4&#8208;ester substitutions followed by cyclization. Furthermore, by applying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) principle, we invented a bright green fluorophore through C3&#8208; and C4&#8208;diester and C6&#8208;aryl substitutions. The ICT fluorophore based on the pyridone structure shows large molar absorptivity (&#1013;=20,100&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em=539&#8197;nm), high emission quantum yield (&#981;F=74&#8201;%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v=5720&#8197;cm&#8722;1), which are comparable to those of practical fluorescent probes.

         <title>Elevating Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Durability through Samarium Oxide/Ketjen Black Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have garnered significant attention as a promising next&#8208;generation battery technology due to their potential for high energy density. However, their practical application is hampered by slow reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates. In this context, the authors introduce a pioneering solution in the form of a novel porous carbon nanostructure modified with samarium oxide, denoted as Sm2O3/KB. The material has a highly polar surface, allowing lithium polysulfide to be chemisorbed efficiently. The unsaturated sites provided by the oxygen vacancies of Sm2O3 promote Li2S nucleation, lowering the reaction energy barrier and accelerating Li2S dissolution. The porous structure of Ketjen Black provides a highly conductive channel for electron transport and effectively traps polysulfides. Meanwhile, the batteries with Sm2O3/KB/PP spacers exhibited remarkable electrochemical performances, including a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of only 0.046&#8201;% for 1000 cycles at 2&#8197;C and an excellent multiplicative performance of 624&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;C. This work opens up a new avenue for the potential use of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Boosting hydrogen production of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst with clean interface via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis represents an attractive strategy for interface engineering to facilitate the charge transfer and separation. This work provides the formation details of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis, which results in clean and direct interfaces that contribute to the efficient hydrogen production to meet the sustainable energy requirement.







Abstract
Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of high energy density and high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB) to meet the growing energy demand is needed. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have proven to be both safe and effective alternative to commercial graphite anode materials. This review summarizes the recent development of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for LIBs, including developments in Nb2O5 materials, ternary niobium&#8208;based oxides, composites with carbon&#8208;based materials, as well as future directions and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.







Abstract
Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. Jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides have the potential to be used as potent immunogens in vaccinations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective opening of pyranosyl epoxides has been taken advantage of to obtain a family of very challenging thiooligosaccharide antigens related to Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens very challenging. So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeeded the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>CBe2H5&#8722;: Unprecedented 2&#963;/2&#960; Double Aromaticity and Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8722; cluster with a planar tetracoordinate carbon center is reported. Unprecedentedly, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately, leading to it exhibiting interesting dynamic fluxionality that can be regarded as a molecular rotor.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom is designed herein. Remarkably, it can be stabilized by only two beryllium atoms with both &#960;&#8208;acceptor/&#963;&#8208;donor properties and two hydrogen atoms, which means that the conversion from planar methane (transition state) to ptC species (global minimum) requires the substitution of only two hydrogen atoms. Moreover, two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, giving rise to interesting dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. The electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of ligand H atoms due to C&#8722;H localized bonds, highlighting the rotational fluxionality in the cluster, and two CBe2 3c&#8211;2e delocalized bonds endow its rare 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process exhibits a conversion in the type of bonding (&#963; bond&#8596;&#960; bond), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster can be seen as an attempt to apply planar hypercoordinate carbon species to molecular motors.

         <title>Fe and Cu Intercalations Enhance SERS of MoO3 through Different Mechanistic Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalations of molybdenum trioxide using Fe and Cu lead to outstanding SERS activities through different mechanistic pathways. The Fe intercalation of molybdenum trioxide facilitates the charge transfer pathways for chemical mechanism, while the Cu intercalation enhances surface plasmon resonance by increasing charge carrier density, leading to electromagnetic mechanism.







Abstract
Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a molecular&#8208;specific analytical technique with various applications. Although electromagnetic (EM) and chemical (CM) mechanisms have been proposed to be the main origins of SERS, exploring highly sensitive SERS substrates with well&#8208;defined mechanistic pathways remains challenging. Since surface and electronic structures of substrates were crucial for SERS activity, zero&#8208;valent transition metals (Fe and Cu) were intercalated into MoO3 to modulate its surface and electronic structures, leading to unexceptional high enhancement factors (1.0&#215;108 and 1.1&#215;1010 for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3, respectively) with decent reproducibility and stability. Interestingly, different mechanistic pathways (CM and EM) were proposed for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 according to mechanistic investigations. The different mechanisms of Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 were rationalized by the electronic structures of the intercalated Fe(0) and Cu(0), which modulates the surface and electronic structures of Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 to differentiate their SERS mechanisms.

         <title>Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane D3h&#8208;(RSiO1.5)14</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The systematic synthesis and solid state structure of the elusive D3h isomer of the T14 silsesquioxane scaffold as phenyl&#8208;substituted T14Ph14 derivative is reported. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) catalysis enables the condensation of two incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxanes.







Abstract
While smaller polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes TnRn (POSS) are readily accessible or even commercially available, unambiguously authenticated larger systems (n&gt;12) have barely been reported. Synthesis and isolation procedures are lengthy, and yields are often very low. Herein, we present the surprisingly straightforward and high&#8208;yielding access to the phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative of a so far only postulated second D3h&#8208;symmetric T14 isomer and with that the largest crystallographically characterized POSS cage with organic substituents. Treatment of the commercially available incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxane with catalytic amounts of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid results in high yields of the T14Ph14 framework, which is isolated in crystalline form by a simple work&#8208;up. D3h&#8208;T14Ph14 was analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The relative energies of all four theoretically possible T14Ph14 isomers were determined by optimization of the corresponding structure using DFT methods.

         <title>Organic Polar Crystals, Second Harmonic Generation, and Piezoelectric Effects from Heteroadamantanes in the Space Group R3m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;halo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantanes with halo=chloro, bromo form polar crystals from solution, exhibiting non&#8208;linear optical and piezoelectric effects. The chloro compound and the bromo compound form substitutional solid solutions.







Abstract
Polar crystalline materials, a subset of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, are highly sought after.

The advantages of oxides are durability and hardness &#8211; downsides are the need for high&#8208;temperature synthesis/processing and often the need to include toxic metals. Organic polar crystals, on the other hand, can avoid toxic metals and can be amenable to solution&#8208;state processing. While the vast majority of polar organic molecules crystallize in non&#8208;polar space groups, we found that both 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantane, for short Cl&#8208;TAA, and also the related Br&#8208;TAA (but not I&#8208;TAA) form polar crystals in the space group R3m, easily obtained from dichloromethane solution. Measurements confirm piezoelectric and SHG properties for Cl&#8208;TAA and Br&#8208;TAA. When the two species are crystallized together, solid solutions form, suggesting that properties of future materials can be tuned continuously.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar crystalline materials, a subset of the non-centrosymmetric materials, are highly sought after. Their symmetry properties make them pyroelectric and also piezoelectric and capable of second-harmonic generation (SHG). For SHG and piezoelectric applications, metal oxides are commonly used. The advantages of oxides are durability and hardness &#8211; downsides are the need for high-temperature synthesis/processing and often the need to include toxic metals. Organic polar crystals, on the other hand, can avoid toxic metals and can be amenable to solution-state processing. While the vast majority of polar organic molecules crystallize in non-polar space groups, we found that both 7-chloro-1,3,5-triazaadamantane, for short Cl-TAA, and also the related Br-TAA (but not I-TAA) form polar crystals in the space group R3m, easily obtained from dichloromethane solution. Measurements confirm piezoelectric and SHG properties for Cl-TAA and Br-TAA.

         <title>Self&#8208;immolation Assisted Morphology Transformation of Prebiotic Lipidated&#8208;cationic Amino Acids: Electro&#8208;droplet Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction to Synthesize Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotic synthesis of cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles and their self&#8208;assembly to form microcompartments. Micellar compartments were transformed into droplet&#8208;like structures via self&#8208;immolation of amphiphiles at high pH. Cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize prebiotic macromolecules (isoprenoid derivatives) at primitive Earth conditions.







Abstract
Compartmentalization protected biomolecules from the fluctuating environments of early Earth. Although contemporary cells mostly use phospholipid&#8208;based bilayer membranes, the utility of non&#8208;bilayer compartments was not ruled out during the prebiotic and modern eras. In the present study, we demonstrated the prebiotic synthesis of lipidated cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles [lauryl ester of lysine (LysL); ornithine (OrnL); and 2,4&#8208;diamino butyric acid (DabL)] using model dry&#8208;down reaction. These amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into micellar membranes. However, the OrnL and DabL&#8208;based micelles undergo pH&#8208;responsive transformation to lipid droplet&#8208;like morphologies, a modelcompartment in the prebiotic Earth. These cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules (isoprene) and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize isoprenoid derivatives at primitive Earth conditions. The self&#8208;assembly of prebiotic amphiphiles, their transformation to droplet compartments, and droplet&#8208;assisted C&#8722;C bond formation reaction might have helped the evolution to synthesize various biomolecules required for the origin of life.

         <title>Design of multi&#8208;luminescent silica&#8208;based nanoparticles for the detection of liquid organic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for detection of liquid organic compounds was demonstrated using SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with a EuIII:EDTA complex and the organic dye BODIPY. The ratiometric photoluminescence detection technique was proved using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions gave NPs with a diameter of ~100&#8197;nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures.







Abstract
Tracer testing in reservoir formations is utilised to determine residual oil saturation as part of optimum hydrocarbon production. Here, we present a novel detection method of liquid organic compounds by monodisperse SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) containing two luminophores, a EuIII:EDTA complex and a newly synthesised fluorophore based on the organic boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;moiety. The particles exhibited stable EuIII PL emission intensity with a long lifetime in aqueous dispersion. The fluorescence of the BODIPY was also preserved in the aqueous environment. The ratiometric PL detection technique was demonstrated by using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions were found to give NPs with a diameter of ~100&#8197;nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures. The cytotoxicity of the NPs was confirmed to be very low for human lung cell and fish cell lines. These findings demonstrate the potential of the NPs to replace the hazardous chemicals used to estimate the residual oil saturation. Moreover, the ratiometric PL detection technique is anticipated to be of benefit in other fields, such as biotechnology, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring, where a reliable and safe detection of a liquid organic phase is needed.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Ketones for the Synthesis of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Disubstituted &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of methyl ketones with cyclic ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are reported. This catalytic route gives a unique opportunity to integrate the chemistry of synthetic challenge cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones and alkene migration reaction into a reaction pot. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
C&#8722;C bond forming reaction of ketone with aldehyde is well&#8208;studied for the synthesis of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, however, the reaction with two different ketones to unsaturated carbonyl compound has not yet been systematically studied. Probably due to the relatively low reactivity of ketones as electrophiles (aldol acceptors), its propensity for retro&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactions often suffer from unsatisfactory chemoselectivity (self&#8208; vs. crossed aldol products) and regioselectivity (thermodynamic vs. kinetic enolate). In this quest, we report here for the first time selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by using ruthenium catalysis. Interestingly, single crossed aldol condensation products are formed even in reactions where a mixture of products is possible. Reaction is highly chemoselective, regioselective and produces H2O as the only byproducts making the protocol environmentally benign. Method is compatible with a wide variety of sensitive functional group and applicable for even problematic aliphatic ketones as substrates. Notably, acetone was found as a three&#8208;carbon feedstock for the syntheses of simple &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketone compounds. The process can further be extended to the gram&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products. With the help of DFT calculations, several control experiments, and deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that initial aldol&#8208;condensation of ketones to a &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which further isomerizes to a &#946;, &#947;&#8208; unsaturated ketone via &#951;3&#8208;allyl ruthenium complex.

         <title>Modification of a Common &#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though non&#8208;innocence of the popular NacNac (BDI) ligand derived from 2,6 diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine has been observed in a few studies, rarely has this non&#8208;innocence been deliberately exploited to generate novel derivatives. Here, we show that tripodal modifications are accessible by a three&#8208;step lithiation&#8208;small molecule insertion&#8208;hydrolysis protocol involving insertion of isocyanates, isothiocyanates, or a carbodiimide.







Abstract
A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Superelastic, Highly Conductive Graphene Aerogel/Liquid Metal Foam and its Piezoresistive Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene aerogel (GA) has important application potential as piezoresistive sensors due to its low density, high conductivity, high porosity, and good mechanical properties. However, the fabrication of GA&#8208;based sensors with good mechanical properties and excellent sensing performance is still challenging. Herein, liquid&#8208; metal&#8208;modified GAs (GA/LM) are proposed for the development of an excellent GA&#8208;based sensor. GA/LM with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected layered structure exhibits excellent compressive stress of 41 KPa and fast response time (&lt;20 ms). While generally flexible GA composites cannot be compressed beyond 80% strain without plastic deformation,GA/LM demonstrates a high compressive strength of 60 kPa under a strain of 90%. A real&#8208;time pressure sensor was fabricated based on GA/LM&#8208;2 to monitor swallowing, pulse beating, finger, wrist and knee bending, and even plantar pressure during walking. These excellent features enable potential applications in health detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;induced Oligomerization of Fluorine&#8208;substituted Phenylazothiazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitches are molecules that can absorb light of specific wavelengths and undergo a reversible transformation between their trans and cis isomeric forms. In phenylazo photoswitches, it is common for the less stable cis (Z) isomer to convert back to the more stable trans (E) isomer either through photochemical or thermal means. In this research, we designed new derivatives of phenylazothiazole (PAT) photoswitches, PAT&#8208;Fn, which feature fluorine substituents on their phenyl component. These derivatives can reversibly isomerize under visible light exposure with the enrichment of E and Z isomers at photostationary state (PSS). Surprisingly, we observed an unconventional phenomenon when these PAT&#8208;Fn (n &#8807;&#160;2) photoswitches were in their cis isomeric state in the absence of light. Instead of the anticipated transformation from cis to trans isomer, these compounds converted to an oligomeric compound. Our detailed experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, indicated the crucial role of fluorine substituents and the distinctive geometric arrangement of the cis isomer in driving the unexpected oligomerization process originating from the cis isomeric state.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4 parallel runs for up to 64 h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran&#8208;fused poly&#8208;ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran&#8208;derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers through emulating the Nakanishi&#8217;s hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8211;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Restrain and Release of the Dynamic Valence Isomerization in a Shape&#8208;shifting Bullvalene by Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In search for structural features that enable the control of the valence isomerization of the fluxional bullvalene, a bullvalene&#8208;bis(harmane) conjugate is identified that acts as chelating ligand in complexes with metal ions. Spectrometric titrations show that this ligand forms 1:1 complexes with Ag+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. Importantly, detailed NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures reveals that the complexation with Ag+ strongly affects the dynamic isomerization of the bullvalene unit of the ligand such that only one predominant valence isomer is formed, even at 5 &#176;C. Detailed 1H&#8208;NMR&#8208;spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11 kJmol&#8211;1) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag+ from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag+ regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit. This method to control the valence isomerism by straightforward chemical stimuli may be used to simplify structural analysis at elevated temperatures, i.e. a feature not available so far with bullvalenes, and it may be employed as functional element in dynamic supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth analysis of the description of bonding within Cp'''Ni&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P3 (Cp'''&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, [Ni]P3) employing X&#8208;ray diffraction based multipolar modeling, density functional theory (DFT) as well as an &#8220;experimental wavefunction&#8221; obtained from X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) fitting is presented. The results are compared to DFT calculations on white phosphorus &#8211; an isolobal analogue to [Ni]P3. A complementary bonding analysis shows insights into the reactivity of [Ni]P3. The isolobal principle is reflected in every aspect of our analysis and the employed methods seamlessly predict the differences in reactivity of [Ni]P3 and P4. Crystallographic modeling, solid&#8208;state NMR, and DFT calculations describe the dynamic behavior of the cyclo&#8208;P3 unit in the title molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insights into the semiquinone form of human Cytochrome P450 reductase by DEER distance measurements between a native flavin and a spin labelled non&#8208;canonical amino acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The flavoprotein Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is the unique electron pathway from NADPH to Cytochrome P450 (CYPs). The conformational dynamics of human CPR in solution, which involves transitions from a "locked/closed" to an "unlocked/open" state, is crucial for electron transfer. To date, however, the factors guiding these changes remain unknown. By Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling coupled to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we have incorporated a non&#8208;canonical amino acid onto the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domains of soluble human CPR, and labelled it with a specific nitroxide spin probe. Taking advantage of the endogenous FMN cofactor, we successfully measured for the first time, the distance distribution by DEER between the semiquinone state FMNH&#183; and the nitroxide. The DEER data revealed a salt concentration&#8208;dependent distance distribution, evidence of an "open" CPR conformation at high salt concentrations exceeding previous reports. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations which unveiled a diverse ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; semiquinone state of the CPR at high salt concentration. This study unravels the conformational landscape of the one electron reduced state of CPR, which had never been studied before.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;F Bond Insertion: An Emerging Strategy for Constructing Fluorinated Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;F Insertion reactions, where an organic fragment formally inserts into a carbon&#8208;fluorine bond in a substrate, are highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, methods to prepare valuable fluorinated molecules. The inherent strength of C&#8208;F bonds and the resulting need for a large thermodynamic driving force to initiate C&#8208;F cleavage often leads to sequestering of the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. Recently, however, several groups have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, opening up the study of C&#8208;F insertion as an efficient and highly atom&#8208;economical approach to prepare fluorinated compounds. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key conceptual advances that allowed for both C&#8208;F bond cleavage and subsequent incorporation of the released fluoride into the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208; and Oxygen&#8208;Doped &#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Nanographene with Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical nanographenes have garnered substantial attention owing to their finely adjustable optical and semiconducting properties. The strategic integration of both helicity and heteroatoms into the nanographene structure, facilitated by a boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;based multiple resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), elevates its photophysical and chiroptical features. This signifies the introduction of an elegant category of helical nanographene that combines optical (TADF) and chiroptical (CPL) features. In this direction, we report the synthesis, optical, and chiroptical properties of boron, oxygen&#8208;doped &#7464;&#8208;extended helical nanographene. The &#960;&#8208;extension induces distortion in the DOBNA&#8208;incorporated nanographene, endowing a pair of helicenes, (P)&#8208;B2NG, and (M)&#8208;B2NG exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with glum of &#8208;2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and +2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. B2NG exhibited MR&#8208;TADF with a lifetime below 5 &#956;s, and a reasonably high fluorescence quantum yield (50%). Our molecular design enriches the optical and chiroptical properties of nanographenes and opens up new opportunities in multidisciplinary fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Mimicking the Shape and Function of the ClC Chloride Channel Selective Pore by Combining a Molecular Hourglass Shape with Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&#8722; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass&#8208;shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure&#8208;function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape&#8208;persistent 1,3&#8208;alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The environmental impact from the waste disposal has been widely concerned around the world. The conversion of wastes to useful resources is important for the sustainable society. As a typical family of wastes, biomass materials basically composed of collagen, protein&#160;and lignin, are considered as useful resources for recycle and reuse. In recent years, the development of carbon material derived from biomasses, such as plants, crops, animals and their application in electrochemical energy storage have attracted extensive attention. Through the selection of the appropriate biomass, the optimization of the activation method and the control of the pyrolysis temperatures, carbon materials with desired features, such as high&#8208;specific surface area, variable porous framework, and controllable heteroatom&#8208;doping have been fabricated. Herein, this review summarized the preparation methods, morphologies, heteroatoms doping in the plant/animal&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials, and their application as electrode materials for secondary batteries and supercapacitors, and as electrode support for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The challenges and prospects for the controllable synthesis and large&#8208;scale application of biomass&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials have also been outlooked.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vitro, 19F NMR methodology is preferably selected as a complementary and straightforward method for unveiling the conformations, dynamics, and interactions of biological molecules. Its effectiveness in vivo has seen continuous improvement, addressing challenges faced by conventional heteronuclear NMR experiments on structured proteins, such as severe line broadening, low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and background signals. Herein,  we summarize the distinctive advantages of 19F NMR, along with recent progress in sample preparation and applications within the realm of in&#8208;cell NMR.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,1'&#8208;Bicarbazoles by Iron(III)&#8208; and Palladium(II)Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#697;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#697;&#8208;biaryls and subsequent twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization provide a convergent synthetic route to 1,1&#697;&#8208;bicarbazoles. Screening a range of different palladium(II) salts led to palladium(II) acetate, pivalate, and hexafluoroacetylacetonate as the most efficient catalysts. Remarkably, the twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization can also be performed under argon. The mechanism for the oxidative cyclization under an inert gas presumably involves regeneration of the catalytically active palladium(II) species by oxidative addition of pivalic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Identification of decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins in Toxic Microalgae and their Reactions with the Oxygenase, SxtT, Reveal Saxitoxin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saxitoxin (STX,&#160;1) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;decarbamoyloxySTX (dd&#8208;doSTX,&#160;2), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX,&#160;3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX,&#160;4), and doSTX (5), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high&#8208;resolution LCMSMS. dd&#8208;doSTX (2) and 12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX (3) were identified in the PSTs&#8208;producing dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella,&#160;A. pacificum, and/or&#160;Gymnodinium catenatum) and in the cyanobacterium&#160;Dolichospermum circinale&#160;(TA04). doSTX (5), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate&#160;G. catenatum, was also identified in&#160;D. circinale&#160;(TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of&#160;2&#160;to&#160;3, and&#160;4&#160;to&#160;5, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis,&#160;was confirmed. These results support that&#160;2&#160;is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8210;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fully enantioselective, catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8211;)&#8208;thallusin using polyene cyclization chemistry is reported. The synthesis features dedicated precursor design, introduction of a TMS&#8208;substituted arene as a regioselective terminator, very high enantiomer excess (ee), on gram scale, and productive scaffold functionalization. Furthermore, an ee determination methodology of thallusin samples was developed, and the ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;uptake studies demonstrated that the cellular uptake of iron facilitated by thallusin derivatives was independent of their morphogenic activity, suggesting their active import via siderophore transporters as a shuttle system.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Epoxidation of Cyclooctene on Surface Modified Ni Foam Using Water as Oxygen Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical epoxidation of olefins using water as an oxygen atom source is emerging as an alternative approach for an atom economic and sustainable method towards a highly selective synthesis of epoxides. We report an electrochemical procedure for epoxidation of cyclooctene using water as the sole oxygen atom source over a sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) modified nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 catalyst directly grown on Ni foam. The SDS modification facilitates the mass transfer of cyclooctene towards the anode, thus achieving a 2.5&#8208;fold higher conversion with more than 90% selectivity towards the corresponding epoxide compared with pure Ni(OH)2 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitable Blue TADF&#8208;Type Afterglow via Delicate Control of Excited States in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue afterglow constitutes of one of the primary afterglow colors and can convert into other afterglow colors through energy transfer. The reported studies show the fabrication of blue afterglow emitters, but most of them are formed by room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence mechanism and require UVB lights as excitation source (these high&#8208;energy lights may damage organic systems). Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. Tiny change of the substituents in BF2bdk system has been found to pose significant influence on excited state energy levels and consequently narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy of the system. As a result, both forward and reverse intersystem crossing have been accelerated, leading to the emergence of BF2bdk&#8217;s TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in rigid crystalline matrices. The resultant TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials exhibit emission lifetimes of several hundred milliseconds, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.7%, and display temperature responsive and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Polyamine Synthesis with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. The limitation is attributed to the synthetic difficulty of accessing functionalized polyamines. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization and In Vitro Behavior of PEO Coated Mg Modified with Antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of Mg&#8208;based biomaterials with a number of their advantageous properties are overshadowed by uncontrollable metal corrosion. Moreover, the use of implants goes alongside with the threat of pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity. To achieve a suitable level of anticorrosion protection phosphate and fluoride&#8208;phosphate electrolytes are used in the PEO process. Investigation of the surface thickness and morphology done by means of cross&#8208;section analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assay show precedence of the fluoride containing PEO coating and make it the material of choice for further modification with Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes. The presence of the complexes on the PEO surface is confirmed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) are used to estimate the complexes&#8217; chemical state and depth of penetration in the coating surface. Based on the results of antibacterial assay, the modified coatings are found to be active against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.</dc:description>

Sharing bonds: This article reports a rare bis&#8208;silylene, [LSi)2&#8722;SiPh2, L=(PhC(NtBu)2] (1), in which a SiIV atom bridges two silylene atoms. Compound 1 contains an unusual SiII&#8722;SiIV&#8722;SiII bonding arrangement with SiII&#8722;SiIV bond lengths of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7)&#8197;&#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe0 complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8722;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10)&#8197;&#197;). NBO and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses reveal that the Si&#8722;Si bonds in 1 and 2 are of an electron&#8208;sharing nature.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a rare bis&#8208;silylene, 1, in which two SiIIatoms are bridged by a SiIV atom. Compound 1 contains an unusual SiII&#8722;SiIV&#8722;SiII bonding arrangement with SiII&#8722;SiIV bond distances of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7)&#8197;&#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe0 complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8722;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10)&#8197;&#197;). We have also carried out a detailed computational study to understand the nature of the Si&#8722;Si bonds in these compounds. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy decomposition analysis&#8211;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analyses reveal that the Si&#8722;Si bonds in 1 and 2 are of an electron&#8208;sharing nature.

         <title>Conformational Preferences at the Glycosidic Linkage of Saccharides in Solution as Deduced from NMR Experiments and MD Simulations: Comparison to Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of solvation on the preferred conformation of saccharides in solution and in crystals is unraveled by solution&#8208;state NMR and computational MD studies of solvated disaccharides. Crystal structures containing solvated glycan structures have glycosidic linkage conformations similar to those of the carbohydrate molecules in solution.







Abstract
Glycans are central to information content and regulation in biological systems. These carbohydrate molecules are active either as oligo&#8208; or polysaccharides, often in the form of glycoconjugates. The monosaccharide entities are joined by glycosidic linkages and stereochemical arrangements are of utmost importance in determining conformation and flexibility of saccharides. The conformational preferences and population distributions at the glycosidic torsion angles &#966; and &#968; have been investigated for O&#8208;methyl glycosides of three disaccharides where the substitution takes place at a secondary alcohol, viz., in &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Fucp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe, &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Fucp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Galp&#8208;OMe and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Galp&#8208;OMe, corresponding to disaccharide structural elements present in bacterial polysaccharides. Stereochemical differences at or adjacent to the glycosidic linkage were explored by solution state NMR spectroscopy using one&#8208;dimensional 1H,1H&#8208;NOESY NMR experiments to obtain transglycosidic proton&#8208;proton distances and one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to obtain 3JCH transglycosidic coupling constants related to torsion angles &#966; and &#968;. Computed effective proton&#8208;proton distances from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed excellent agreement to experimentally derived distances for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides and revealed that for the bimodal distribution at the &#968; torsion angle for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide experiment and simulation were at variance with each other, calling for further force field developments. The MD simulations disclosed a highly intricate inter&#8208;residue hydrogen bonding pattern for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide, including a nonconventional hydrogen bond between H5&#8242; in the glucosyl residue and O3 in the galactosyl residue, supported by a large downfield 1H NMR chemical shift displacement compared to &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe. Comparison of population distributions of the glycosidic torsion angles &#966; and &#968; in the disaccharide entities to those of corresponding crystal structures highlighted the potential importance of solvation on the preferred conformation.

         <title>Hexakispyrazolylethane: New Strategy for Stabilization of Hexaarylethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane as a stable analog of hexaphenylethane. Introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through three N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N bonds.







Abstract
Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane showed that the ethane C&#8722;C bond (1.623(4)&#8197;&#197;) is shorter than that in hexaphenylethane (1.67(3)&#8197;&#197;). In solution, hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane existed as a single species, contrastive that conventional hexaphenylethanes can keep the central C&#8722;C bond only by the aid of additional bridges between the two triarylmethyl units. Theoretical calculations indicated that the tris(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl radical, which is anticipated to be under equilibrium with hexakis(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane, is less stable than trityl radicals due to lack of delocalization of the radicals. Furthermore, introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through metal coordination to the adjacent N atoms: hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane exhibited unique coordination to three Ag atoms affording a hexaarylethane analog bearing three N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N bridges.

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for the Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several ortho&#8208;carboranes functionalized in the B9 position were prepared and grafted to phosphorus dendritic compounds. 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carboranes were also synthesized for eventual applications in catalysis or the medicinal sector.







Abstract
Several ortho&#8208;carboranes bearing a phenoxy or a phenylamino group in the B9 position were prepared employing various protection and deprotection strategies. Following established protocols, dendritic compounds were synthesized from a hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or thiophosphoryl chloride core, and possible anchoring options for the B9&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;carboranes were investigated experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Furthermore, 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carborane derivatives were obtained. The resulting diethyl&#8208;, diisopropyl&#8208;, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;, diphenyl&#8208; or diethoxyphosphines bearing a tunable ortho&#8208;carborane moiety are intriguing ligands for future applications in homogeneous catalysis or the medicinal sector.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Skeletal Editing of Indazoles by Donor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;atomic skeletal editing technique that utilizing donor&#8208;type carbenes for efficient insertion into the N&#8722;N bond of indazoles is described. This method effectively simplifies the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline by introducing monoaryl, diaryl, aryl or alkenyl groups onto this heterocyclic skeleton.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of heterocyclic scaffolds in drug&#8208;related molecules, converting these highly modular heterocyclic scaffolds into structural diversified and dearomatized analogs is an ideal strategy for improving their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we described an efficient method for silver carbene&#8208;mediated dearomative N&#8722;N bond cleavage leading to skeletal hopping between indazole and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline via a highly selective single&#8208;carbon insertion procedure. Using this methodology, a series of dihydroquinazoline analogues with diarylmethylene&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon centers were constructed with excellent yields and good functional group compatibility, which was further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of important pharmaceutically active ingredients. DFT calculations indicated that the silver catalyst not only induces the formation of the silver carbene, but also activates the diazahexatriene intermediate, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation by a Multicomponent Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough methodology work on the Ugi multicomponent reaction applied to the conjugation of native proteins highlighted key reaction conditions and reagents for the development of a highly site&#8208;selective procedure.







Abstract
The chemical bioconjugation of proteins has seen tremendous applications in the past decades, with the booming of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and their use in oncology. While genetic engineering has permitted to produce bespoke proteins featuring key (un&#8722;)natural amino acid residues poised for site&#8208;selective modifications, the conjugation of native proteins is riddled with selectivity issues. Chemoselective strategies are plentiful and enable the precise modification of virtually any residue with a reactive side&#8208;chain; site&#8208;selective methods are less common and usually most effective on small and medium&#8208;sized proteins. In this context, we studied the application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of amine and carboxylate groups on proteins, and antibodies in particular. Through an in&#8208;depth mechanistic methodology work supported by peptide mapping studies, we managed to develop a set of conditions allowing the highly selective modification of antibodies bearing N&#8208;terminal glutamate and aspartate residues. We demonstrated that this strategy did not alter their affinity toward their target antigen and produced an antibody&#8208;drug conjugate with subnanomolar potency. Excitingly, we showed that the high site selectivity of our strategy was maintained on other protein formats, especially on anticalins, for which directed mutagenesis helped to highlight the key importance of a single lysine residue.

         <title>Gold&#8208;promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic gold(III) compounds are introduced here as a valuable addition to the toolkit of metal&#8208;based systems apt at facilitating selenium arylation, with applications spanning from synthetic chemistry to selenoprotein modification. By combining multinuclear NMR, LC&#8211;MS and DFT we show that the compound [Au(bnpy)Cl2] enables the arylation of diselenides and selenols present in small molecules, peptides, and proteins via a redox&#8208;based mechanism.







Abstract
A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8&#8197;&#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se&#8201;NMR), and LC&#8211;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8722;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization.

     alt="Gold-promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organometallic gold(III) compounds are introduced here as a valuable addition to the toolkit of metal-based systems apt at facilitating selenium arylation, with applications spanning from synthetic chemistry to selenoprotein modification. By combining multinuclear NMR, LC&#8211;MS and DFT we show that the compound [Au(bnpy)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] enables the arylation of diselenides and selenols present in small molecules, peptides, and proteins via a redox-based mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8&#8197;&#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site-selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Se&#8201;NMR), and LC&#8211;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8722;Se)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and selenocystine, (Sec)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8722;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8722;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8722;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8722;Se)-AVP), and the &lt;i&gt;Bos taurus&lt;/i&gt; glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2&#8197;mM, pH=7.0).

         <title>Triflate's bigger brother: The unprecedented tribrate anion, [Br3CSO3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tribromomethansulfonate anion (&#8220;tribrate&#8221;), [Br3CSO3]&#8722;, has been prepared for the first time. The anion is, up to now, the biggest brother of the well&#8208;known triflate anion. Key step of the synthesis is the bromination of phenyl&#8208;methanesulfonate by KOBr. The new anion could be investigated in the solid state for the example of K[Br3CSO3](H2O).







Abstract
The synthesis of the unprecedented [Br3CSO3]&#8722; anion starts with the bromination of phenylmethanesulfonate, C6H5OSO2CH3, with KOBr leading to C6H5OSO2CBr3. The formation of the [CBr3] moiety has been proved, also by an X&#8208;ray structure determination of the compound (triclinic, P&#8208;1, a=685.9(2), b=698.1(2), c=1190.2(3)&#8197;pm, &#945;=93.99(1)&#176;, &#946;=97.42(1)&#176;, &#947;=94.45(1)&#176;). The ester C6H5OSO2CBr3 can be split under basic conditions. The resulting acid provides access to the yet unknown tribromomethanesulfates (&#8220;tribrates&#8221;). K[Br3CSO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, the first tribrate known so far has been characterized comprehensively, including an X&#8208;ray structure determination (monoclinic, C2/c, a=2267.1(2), b=1282.25(8), c=2618.2(2)&#8197;pm, &#946;=111.266(2)&#176;), vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Moreover, the thermal analysis shows that, after loss of the crystal water, the tribrate decomposes between 530 and 630&#8197;K.

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes with Pyrrole Substitution Enables STED and Lifetime Imaging of Lysosomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole substitution produced fluorogenic rhodamine probes with high brightness, large Stokes shift, red&#8208;shifted fluorescence emission and enhanced environmental sensitivity. Good cell permeability, low toxicity and favorable turn on fluorescence response to low polarity, high viscosity as well as acidity facilitate wash&#8208;free high contrast STED and lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.







Abstract
Fluorogenic dyes with high brightness, large turn&#8208;on ratios, excellent photostability, favorable specificity, low cytotoxicity, and high membrane permeability are essential for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in live cells. In this study, we endowed these desirable properties to a rhodamine derivative by simply replacing the N, N&#8208;diethyl group with a pyrrole substituent. The resulting dye, Rh&#8208;NH, exhibited doubled Stokes shifts (54&#8197;nm) and a red&#8208;shift of more than 50&#8197;nm in fluorescence spectra compared to Rhodamine B. Rh&#8208;NH preferentially exists in a non&#8208;emissive but highly permeable spirolactone form. Upon binding to lysosomes, the collective effects of low pH, low polarity, and high viscosity endow Rh&#8208;NH with significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on, making it a suitable candidate for wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast lysosome tracking. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NH enabled us to successfully explore stimulated emission depletion (STED) super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosome dynamics, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.

A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The torus&#8208;like nanostructures carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes and act as dual&#8208;action agents silencing two oncogenes EGFR and c&#8208;Myc simultaneously. The system can be readily adapted to target other biological components.







Abstract
A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The obtained, torus&#8208;like nanoparticles carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes simultaneously. The nanoparticles exhibited notable silencing efficiency in&#8197;vitro in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC&#8208;1 toward EGFR and c&#8208;Myc genes at the mRNA level, and a significant efficiency at the protein level. The proposed approach may be an attractive alternative to methods currently used, including one therapeutic nucleic acid, one genetic target, or the use of cocktails of therapeutic nucleic acids.

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches has been designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, and satisfactory photoconversion rates. High&#8208;quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved and the photoisomerization mechanism to be elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;M. Grabarz, M. Cig&#225;&#328; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303509).

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study to Develop Peptide Amphiphiles as Species&#8208;Specific Antimicrobials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles nanostructures were studied regarding the supramolecular structure&#8208;activity and the key structure contributors for activity. For Staphylococcus aureus the zeta potential was more important while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by LogP. Mechanism of action and an in&#8197;vivo study was also performed. We showed these nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of novel nanoantibacterials.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a promising class of molecules that can disrupt the bacterial membrane or act as drug nanocarriers. In this study, we prepared 33&#8197;PAs to establish supramolecular structure&#8208;activity relationships. We studied the morphology and activity of the nanostructures against different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the key contributors to activity. We found that for S. aureus, the zeta potential was the major contributor to the activity while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by the partition coefficient (LogP) with the following order P. aeruginosa&gt;E. coli&gt;A. baumannii. We also performed a study of the mechanism of action of selected PAs on the bacterial membrane assessing the membrane permeability and depolarization, changes in zeta potential and overall integrity. We studied the toxicity of the nanostructures against mammalian cells. Finally, we performed an in&#8197;vivo study using the wax moth larvae to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the active PAs. This study shows cationic PA nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of nanoantibacterials.

         <title>Plasma Technology for Advanced Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective paper, we discuss the working principle of plasma and its applied research on battery materials based on plasma conversion, deposition, etching, doping, etc. Furthermore, the new application directions of multiphase plasma associated with solid, liquid and gas sources are proposed and their application examples for batteries are given. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of plasma technology are briefly summarized to provide guidance for the next generation of energy technologies.







Abstract
&#8220;Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality&#8221; is an important strategic goal for the sustainable development of human society. Typically, a key means to achieve these goals is through electrochemical energy storage technologies and materials. In this context, the rational synthesis and modification of battery materials through new technologies play critical roles. Plasma technology, based on the principles of free radical chemistry, is considered a promising alternative for the construction of advanced battery materials due to its inherent advantages such as superior versatility, high reactivity, excellent conformal properties, low consumption and environmental friendliness. In this perspective paper, we discuss the working principle of plasma and its applied research on battery materials based on plasma conversion, deposition, etching, doping, etc. Furthermore, the new application directions of multiphase plasma associated with solid, liquid and gas sources are proposed and their application examples for batteries (e.&#8201;g. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, zinc&#8208;air batteries) are given. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of plasma technology are briefly summarized to provide guidance for the next generation of energy technologies.

         <title>A Torquoselective Thermal 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Approach to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes via Solvent&#8208;Aided Proton Transfer: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes can be directly synthesized by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents at 90&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. This is done through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer process.







Abstract
The thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of hexatriene typically delivers 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,3&#8208;CHD). However, there is only limited success in directly synthesizing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) using such an approach, probably due to the difficulty in realizing thermally&#8208;forbidden 1,3&#8208;hydride shift after electrocyclic ring closure. The present study shows that by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes bearing ester or ketone substituents at the C1&#8208;position in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents at 90&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C, 1,4&#8208;CHDs can be selectively synthesized. This is achieved through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a proton&#8208;transfer process. The success of this method depends on the polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted intramolecular proton transfer from 1,3&#8208;CHD to 1,4&#8208;CHD, which has been confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. There are no reports to date for such a solvent&#8208;assisted isomerization. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have suggested that forming 1,3&#8208;CHD and subsequent isomerization is a thermodynamically feasible process, regardless of the functional groups involved. Two possible successive polar solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer pathways have been identified for isomerization.

         <title>Impact of Endcap Molecules on Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Oligomers in Structural Color Stability and Hypsochromic Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers are an interesting class of temperature responsive structurally, colored materials. However, the role of endcap molecules in these oligomers is rather unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the role of endcap molecules on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift in temperature&#8208;responsive cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. First, new liquid crystal monoacrylate endcap molecules are synthesized, which are then used to synthesize various cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. In addition, cholesteric oligomers using commercial monoacrylate endcap molecules are also prepared. It is found that the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the oligomers can be tuned by the endcapping molecules. The oligomers are used to produce reflective, structurally colored coatings. It was found that the coatings using the commercial monoacrylate their color and crystallize over time, most likely due to the presence of crystalline dimers. The coatings containing the newly synthesized monoacrylate endcap molecules did not exhibit this crystallization, resulting in structurally colored coatings that remained stable over time. These latter coatings exhibited temperature responsive hypochromic behavior, which makes them interesting for advanced optical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for mapping photochemical reaction outcomes wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength. Typically, they map either the depletion of a reactant or the formation of a specific product as a function of wavelength. Herein, we exploit action plots to simultaneously map the formation of several photochemical products from a single chromophore. We demonstrate that the wavelength&#8208;resolved mapping of two reaction products formed during the irradiation of a chalcone species not only shows wavelength dependence &#8211; exhibiting the typical strong red&#8208;shift of the photochemical reactivity compared to the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore &#8211; but also a strong wavelength selectivity with remarkably different product distributions resulting from different irradiation wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and functionalities of FeSn12&#160;superatom prepared by single atom introduction with a dendrimer template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superatoms are promising as new building block materials that can be designed by precise controlling of the constituent atoms. Stannaspherene (Sn122&#8211;) is a rigid cage&#8208;like cluster with icosahedral symmetry, for which one&#8208;atom encapsulation was theoretically expected and detected in the gas phase. Here, a single&#8208;atom introduction method into stannaspherene using a dendrimer template with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) protection is demonstrated. This advanced solution&#8208;phase synthesis allows not only the selective doping of one atom into the cluster cage, but also enable further detail characterization of optical and magnetic properties that were not possible in the gas&#8208;phase synthesis. In other words, this liquid&#8208;phase synthesis method has enabled the adaptation of detailed analytical methods. In this study, FeSn12 was synthesized and characterized, revealing that a single Fe atom introduction in the Sn122&#8211; cage result in the appearance of near&#8208;infrared emission and enhancement in the magnetism.</dc:description>

         <title>Transport Properties with Multiple Functions of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR Single Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encouraged by the successful fabrication of C60&#8208;GNR (GNR = graphene nanoribbon) single&#8208;molecule transistors in experiments, four Fe&#8208;containing derived double&#8208;layered devices of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR&#160;are designed by employing different electrode linkages and their transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green&#8217;s function (NEGF) methods. Regardless of electrode connection, all devices give rise to a smaller negative differential resistance (NDR) peak at V=0.2 and a higher peak at 1.2 V, suggesting their stable maneuverability as molecular devices and good candidates for developing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) current switches. The macroscopic NDR performance depends on the delocalization character and crossing mechanism of the frontier orbitals. The peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios (Rmax) range from 454 to 2737, determined by the electrode linkage. Such a large Rmax&#8208;value is necessary for developing dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM) cells. Encapsulating the Fe atom inside C60 not improves the conductivity but&#160;introduces spin&#8208;polarized transport property. The spin&#8208;filtering efficiency (SFE) of almost all devices oscillates up and down in response to the bias voltage, indicating the possibility of designing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) spin switches and up&#8208;down spin switches. All these fascinating properties provide an important clue for designing similar molecular devices with multiple functions by trapping magnetic transition metal atoms inside fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress of the Cathode Material Design for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic compounds with the advantages of renewable resources, environmental friendliness, and diverse structures have attracted tremendous interests on aqueous energy storage field. This review focuses on the energy storage mechanism of the aqueous Zn&#8208;organic battery and the recent advances of various organic cathodes including small&#8208;molecule compounds and polymers. Especially novel organic polymer materials, including conjugated polymers (CPs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are reviewed in detail. In addition, we also discuss the remaining challenges and future development of the organic cathode in aqueous ZOBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as the most promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Simultaneously, the utilization of organic electrode materials with renewable resources, environmental compatibility, and diverse structures has sparked a surge in research and development of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A comprehensive review is warranted to systematically present recent advancements in design principles, synthesis techniques, energy storage mechanisms, and zinc&#8208;ion storage performance of organic cathodes. In this review article, we comprehensively summarize the energy storage mechanisms employed by aqueous ZOBs. Subsequently, we categorize organic cathode materials into small&#8208;molecule compounds and high&#8208;molecular polymers respectively. Novel polymer materials such as conjugated polymers (CPs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highlighted with an overview of molecular design strategies and structural optimization based on organic cathode materials aimed at enhancing the performance of aqueous ZOBs. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by aqueous ZOBs along with future prospects to offer insights into their practical applications.

         <title>Unmasking the Electrochemical Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers on Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers reveals that NHCs are a stable architecture for electrode modification from &#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V and for over 40&#8197;hours of continuous voltammetric cycling. However, the NHCs undergo degradation at extreme voltages and after extensive cycling, which raises critical questions about their viability in electrochemical applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers are transforming electrocatalysis and biosensor design via their increased performance and stability. Despite their increasing use in electrochemical systems, the integrity of the NHC monolayer during voltage perturbations remains largely unknown. Herein, we deploy surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to measure the stability of two model NHCs on gold in ambient conditions as a function of applied potential and under continuous voltammetric interrogation. Our results illustrate that NHC monolayers exhibit electrochemical stability over a wide voltage window (&#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V vs Ag|AgCl), but they are found to degrade at strongly reducing (&lt; &#8722;1&#8197;V) or oxidizing (&gt;0.5&#8197;V) potentials. We also address NHC monolayer stability under continuous voltammetric interrogation between 0.2&#8197;V and &#8722;0.5&#8197;V, a commonly used voltage window for sensing, showing they are stable for up to 43&#8197;hours. However, we additionally find that modifications of the backbone NHC structure can lead to significantly shorter operational lifetimes. While these results highlight the potential of NHC architectures for electrode functionalization, they also reveal potential pitfalls that have not been fully appreciated in electrochemical applications of NHCs.

         <title>Osme Bond: Geometric and Energetic Features in the Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis bases exert a role in important oxidation processes such as epoxidation and dihydroxylation. It has been shown that the attractive interaction driving the formation of these adducts is a &#160;&#963;&#8208;hole bond involving the metal as the electrophilic species; the term Osme Bond (OmB) was proposed for designating it. Here some new adducts between OsO4 and various bases have been characterized through single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational studies (density functional theory, DFT), confirming the existence of a robust correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and deformation of the tetrahedral geometry of OsO4. Also some adducts formed by RuO4 with nucleophiles were investigated computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Geometry Regulated J&#8208; and H&#8208;Type Aggregates of Photoswitchable Organogelator: Phase&#8208;Selective Thixotropic Gelation and Oil Spill Recovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate supramolecular polymerization and formation of 1D nanofiber of azobenzene based organogelator (AZO&#8208;4) in cyclic hydrocarbon solvents (toluene and methylcyclohexane). The AZO&#8208;4 exhibits J&#8208; and H&#8208;type aggregates in toluene: MCH (9:1) and MCH: toluene (9:1) respectively. The type of aggregate was governed by the geometry of the solvents used in the self&#8208;assembly process. The J&#8208;type aggregates with high thermal stability in toluene is due to the enhanced interaction of AZO&#8208;4 &#960;&#8208; surface with the toluene &#960;&#8208;surface, whereas H&#8208;aggregate with moderate thermal stability in MCH was due to the interruption of the cyclic hydrocarbon in van der Waals interactions of peripheral chains of AZO&#8208;4 molecule. The light induced reversible photoisomerization is observed for both J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The macroscopic property revealed spontaneous and strong gelation in toluene preferably due to the strong interactions of the AZO&#8208;4 nanofibers with the toluene solvent molecules compared to the MCH. The rheological measurements revealed thixotropic nature of the gels by step&#8208;strain experiments at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameter of gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition was determined for all the gels to get more insight into the gelation property. Furthermore, the phase selective gelation property was extended to the oil spill recovery application using diesel/water and petrol/water mixture.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern nanodrug delivery technologies offer new approaches in the fight against cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors and side effects of anticancer drugs, monotherapies are less effective. Herein, we report a novel pH and light dual&#8208;responsive nanodrug delivery platform. The platform was formed by sulfonate&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles loaded with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and then covered by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene as nanovalves. The nanovalve formed by the host&#8208;guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the sulfonic acid groups grafted onto the gold nanoparticles increased the drug loading capacity of the nanoplatform and enabled sustained release of the drug in a simulated weakly acidic tumor environment. The released GOx can consume intracellular glucose, namely, starvation therapy, while the generated hydrogen peroxide can further kill tumor cells, complementing DOX chemotherapy. Gold nanoparticles have good photothermal conversion ability and can enhance the drugs release rate under specific wavelengths of light irradiation. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that this novel nanodrug delivery platform has good biocompatibility and better therapeutic efficacy relative to monotherapy. This study successfully developed a combined chemo/starvation therapy strategy with good tumor suppression, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Activation at NiII&#8208;CO22&#8211; Moieties through Lewis Acid Interactions in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel complexes with a two&#8208;electron reduced CO2 ligand (CO22&#8211;, &#8220;carbonite&#8221;) are investigated with regard to the influence alkali metal (AM) ions have as Lewis acids on the activation of the CO2 entity. For this purpose complexes with NiII(CO2)AM (AM = Li, Na, K) moieties were accessed via deprotonation of nickel&#8208;formate compounds with (AM)N(iPr)2. It was found that not only the nature of the AM ions in vicinity to CO2 affect the activation, but also the number and the ligation of a given AM. To this end the effects of added (AM)N(R)2, THF, open and closed polyethers as well as cryptands were systematically studied. In 14 cases the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and correlations with the situation in solution were made. The more the AM ions get detached from the carbonite ligand, the lower is the degree of aggregation. At the same time the extent of CO2 activation is decreased as indicated by the structural and spectroscopic analysis and reactivity studies. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the coordinating AM Lewis acidic fragment withdraws only a small amount of charge from the carbonite moiety, but it also affects the internal charge equilibration between the LtBuNi and carbonite moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>BACTERIA AT WORK &#8208; EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES REVEAL THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF ECTOINE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu&#8208;57, Tyr&#8208;84 and His&#8208;92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe2+&#8208;cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of the Nonreducing Hexasaccharide Fragment and the Dodecasaccharide Scaffold of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide.&#160;The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.</dc:description>

         <title>Tryptophan&#8208;Doped Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films with Ultralong&#8208;Lifetime Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Color&#8208;Tunable Afterglow Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a persistent luminescence system with long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable afterglow at room temperature represents a challenge, largely due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathway. In this study, an ultralong&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system has been achieved using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding strategy where poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices were doped with tryptophan (Trp) derivatives. The PVA film doped with N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(9&#8208;Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan (Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) exhibited a long&#8208;lived phosphorescence emission of up to 3859.70 ms, and a blue afterglow for a duration greater than 34 s, under ambient conditions. The introduction of two other fluorescent dyes (i.e., Rhodamine B and Basicred14) to the PVA film facilitates adjustment to the color of the afterglow from blue to orange, and pink, by a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process. These films have been successfully applied in silk&#8208;screen printing and in multicolor afterglow light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8208;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#183;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8208; = 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#183;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2',2'',2'''&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2'&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42%).</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Dual&#8208;Emission in PLICT Compounds &#8211; an Empirical Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Chemical Bond in Semiconductor/MXene Composites: TiO2 Clusters Anchored on the Ti2C MXene Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First&#8208;principles calculations on titania clusters (TiO2)n (n = 5 and 10) supported on the pristine Ti2C (0001) surface were carried out to understand the properties of semiconductor/MXene composites with implications in (photo)&#8208;catalysis. The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1s) and O(1s) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF + Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Cu, Fe, or Ni&#8208;doped diamane sheets: A DFT study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poor mass transfer behavior and inherent activity limit the efficiency of traditional catalysts in electrocatalyzing carbon dioxide reduction reactions. However, the development of novel nanomaterials provides new strategies to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose novel single&#8208;metal atom catalysts, namely diamane&#8208;based electrocatalysts doped with Cu, Fe, and Ni, explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thoroughly investigated the doping pattern and energetics for different dopants. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the conversion process of CO2 to C1 or C2+ products, utilizing the free energy analysis of reaction pathways. Our results reveal that dopants could only be introduced into diamane following a specific pattern. Dopants significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption ability of diamane, with Fe and Ni proving notably more effective than Cu. After CO2 adsorption, Cu&#8208; and Fe&#8208;doped diamane prefer to catalyze CO2RR, while Ni&#8208;doped diamane favors hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The C&#8208;C coupling reaction on Cu&#8208;hollow diamane, Cu&#8208;bridge diamane and Fe&#8208;hollow diamane tends to from C2+ products. Among all examined catalysts, Cu&#8208;hollow diamane shows better electro&#8208;catalytic performance. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of and contributes to the development of diamane based electro&#8208;catalysts for CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Congested Protecting Group for a Boronyl Group in Iterative Aminations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we found that the sterically bulky &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety is a suitable framework for protecting the boronyl group of boron reagents during aminations. Condensation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide with ArB(OH)2 produced aryloxazaborolidinone (ArOxB). The reactivity of the C&#8208;B bond in ArOxB is easily controlled by the steric and weak electronic effects of the backbone. H2N&#8208;(or Br&#8208;)ArOxB underwent Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam (C&#8208;E&#8208;L) or Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig (B&#8208;H) amination with retaining the C&#8208;B bond. On the other hand, direct C&#8208;E&#8208;L amination of ArOxB was also possible in an oxidative atmosphere, in which the C&#8208;B bond was activated by CuII species. Our methodology is effective for the precise synthesis of two or more arylamino group substituted arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Ugi Reactions versus In&#8208;Situ Ligation Screening: Two Roads to the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;templated fragment ligation was established as a method for the rapid identification of high affinity ligands, and multicomponent reactions (MCR) such as the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 4CR) have been efficient in the synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, the combination of both strategies should provide a powerful approach to drug discovery. Here, we investigate protein&#8208;templated Ugi 4CR quantitatively using a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme assay, HPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;MS, and native protein MS with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease as template. Ugi reactions were analyzed in aqueous buffer at varying pH and fragment concentration. Potent inhibitors of the protease were formed in presence of the protein via Ugi 4CR together with Ugi three&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 3CR) products. Binding of inhibitors to the protease was confirmed by native mass spectrometry and resulted in the dimerization of the protein target. Formation of Ugi products was, however, more efficient in the non&#8208;templated reaction, apparently due to interactions of the protein with the isocyanide and imine fragments. Consequently, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi 4CR products was identified as a superior approach to the discovery of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease inhibitors.</dc:description>
