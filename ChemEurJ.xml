         <title>Sequential H/D Exchanges Resulting from Rollover&#8208;Cyclometallation during Photoirradiation of Rhodium(III) Complex in Methanol&#8208;d4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N^N)2(ox)]+) in CD3OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8211;H and Rh&#8211;C s bonds, [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (C^N = [6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8242;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N^N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N^N)2]+ formation. Although [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ is initially converted to [Rh(N^N)2]+ by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N^N)2]+ complex. [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8211;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;positions of the N^N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N^N)2]+ to [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8211;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N^N)2]+ accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Functional Applications of Precision Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science&#8212;a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8208;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8208;water H&#8208;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Is the E/Z Iminium Ratio a Good Enantioselectivity Predictor in Iminium Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes using mass spectrometry and ion mobility to determine the isomer ratio of organocatalyst iminium ions. These ions are involved in the enantioselective addition of nucleophiles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The isomer ratio, referred to as the &#8242;enantioselective potential&#8242;, is then compared with two reactions to evaluate its ability to predict enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high&#8208;throughput method; when combined with ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4&#8208;addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.

Mass spectrometry is a high-throughput method; when combined with ion-mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4-addition to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)&#8208;Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dinuclear gold(I) porphyrin complexes that could activate dioxygen (O2) in polar protic solvents was synthesized and their reactivities were evaluated. The revealed mechanistic insights indicate the coordination of O2 to a gold center and the importance of hydrogen bonding of an NH proton in a porphyrin ligand.







Abstract
Interactions between gold&#8208;based materials and dioxygen (O2) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O2 activation by homo&#8208; and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle&#8208;distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O2 activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O2 activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8722;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.

     alt="Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)-Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of dinuclear gold(I) porphyrin complexes that could activate dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in polar protic solvents was synthesized and their reactivities were evaluated. The revealed mechanistic insights indicate the coordination of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a gold center and the importance of hydrogen bonding of an NH proton in a porphyrin ligand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions between gold-based materials and dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation by homo- and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle-distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8722;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide&#8208;Functionalized N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective synthesis: A new family of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHCs was created by a simple oxidation protocol from thioether&#8208;NHC. Associated with Ru(p&#8208;cymene), these NHC&#8208;SO ligands allow the formation of a single diastereomer in the form of an enantiomeric couple. This interesting selectivity is discussed by means of DFT calculations and experiments.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. Using these salts, a series of cationic [Ru(II)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(NHC&#8208;SO)Cl]+ complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag2O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X&#8208;ray diffractometry studies of complexes 4&#8201;b, 4&#8201;c, 4dBArF and 4&#8201;e unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;C,S) coordination mode of the NHC&#8208;SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in 1H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes. DFT calculations showed a possible intrinsic energy difference between the two pairs of diastereomer. The calculated energy barriers suggested that inversion of the sulfoxide is only plausible from the higher energy diastereomer together with bulky substituents. Inverting the configuration at the Ru center instead shows a lower and accessible activation barrier to provide the most stable diastereomer through thermodynamic control, consistent with the observation of a single species by 1H NMR as a pair of enantiomers. All these complexes catalyse the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols. Complex 4dPF6 bearing an NHC&#8208;functionalised S&#8208;Ad group has been further studied with different primary and secondary alcohols as substrates, showing high reactivity and high to moderate &#946;&#8208;ol&#8208;selectivities.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review of Solar Photocatalysis &amp; Photothermal Catalysis for Hydrogen Production from Biomass: from Material Characteristics to Engineering Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes solar photo/photothermal catalysis (PPTC) H2 production from biomass to promote its engineering applications. It reviews design strategies and mechanisms for catalytic reforming. It presents the contribution of the reactor to H2 production performance and analyzes the effects of heat mass transfer and radiation. Finally, it concludes and outlooks PPTC for H2 production.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with particular attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass hydrogen production. The types of photoreforming, including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis, were discussed, consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid&#8208;liquid two&#8208;phase flow and inter&#8208;particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale&#8208;up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.

         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl halides to aldehydes has been studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides react with phenyl aldehyde to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Morever, phenyl chloride with aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes synthesize dibenzyl alcohols in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#8201;&#176;C in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ni-catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#8201;&#176;C in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual pH and Ca2+&#8208;Responsive PEG&#8208;Modified Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanodrug Delivery System: Excellent Cargo Encapsulation and Minimal Drug Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug carrier WP5&#8835;EV has been formed by host&#8208;guest assembly. The carrier shows excellent cargo encapsulation properties and effectively prolongs the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the drug. Importantly, WP5&#8835;EV can minimize the toxicity of the drug and enhance the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is one of the most employed strategies in clinical treatment of cancer. However, reducing medication adverse effects and improving the biological activity remains a significant issue for chemotherapy. We developed a pH and Ca2+&#8208;responsive pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) WP5&#8835;EV@DOX to address the aforementioned challenges. The formation of this NDDS began with the spontaneous formation of supramolecular nanodrug carrier WP5&#8835;EV in water from PEG&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene and the bipyridilium salt derivative EV through simple host&#8208;guest interaction. Then the antitumor drug doxorubicin DOX was efficiently loaded with a high encapsulation rate of 84.6&#8201;%. Cytotoxicity results indicated that the constructed nanoplatform not only reduced DOX toxicity and side effects on normal cell (293T), but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity on cancer cell (HepG2). Moreover, in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that WP5&#8835;EV@DOX had a longer half&#8208;life and higher bioavailability in the blood of mice compared to the nake drug DOX, with increases to 212&#8201;% and 179&#8201;%, respectively. Therefore, WP5&#8835;EV@DOX has great potential in tumor therapy and provides a new idea for host&#8208;guest drug delivery system.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Promoted on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface formation of a novel B&#8722;O&#8722;B bond is promoted by oxygen atoms on the Au(111) surface upon breaking of the B&#8722;C bond in tri&#8208;naphthyl boroxine molecules. As a result, the synthesis of polyboroxine species is obtained and monitored by X&#8208;ray core spectroscopy.







Abstract
We present a protocol for the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment.

         <title>Semisynthetic Glycoconjugates as Potential Vaccine Candidates Against Haemophilus influenzae Type a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the protein conjugates of Haemophilus influenzae type a (Hia) capsular polysaccharide oligomers is reported. The obtained neoglycoconjugates, comprising from one to five well&#8208;defined disaccharide repeating units, were employed in immunization studies, showing their ability to induce a specific immune response.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate vaccines are based on chemical conjugation of pathogen&#8208;associated carbohydrates with immunogenic carrier proteins and are considered a very cost&#8208;effective way to prevent infections. Most of the licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of saccharide antigens extracted from bacterial sources. However, synthetic oligosaccharide antigens have become a promising alternative to natural polysaccharides with the advantage of being well&#8208;defined structures providing homogeneous conjugates. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is responsible for a number of severe diseases. In recent years, an increasing rate of invasive infections caused by Hi serotype a (Hia) raised some concern, because no vaccine targeting Hia is currently available. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Hia is constituted by phosphodiester&#8208;linked 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol&#8208;5&#8208;(PO4&#8594;) repeating units and is the antigen for protein&#8208;conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. To investigate the antigenic potential of the CPS from Hia, we synthesized related saccharide fragments containing up to five repeating units. Following the synthetic optimization of the needed disaccharide building blocks, they were assembled using the phosphoramidite approach for the installation of the phosphodiester linkages. The resulting CPS&#8208;based Hia oligomers were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated in&#8197;vivo for their immunogenic potential, showing that all glycoconjugates were capable of raising antibodies recognizing Hia synthetic fragments.

         <title>Ring Rearrangement Reactions of 4&#8208;Alkenylisocoumarins and Photophysical Evaluation of Multi&#8208;Substituted Anthracene Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several &#960;&#8208;extended homophthalates have been synthesised by novel ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing cascade reaction of lactol silyl ethers bearing acrylate moiety. Thus obtained homophthalates can be used as effective C4 building blocks for polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a fluoride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nucleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.

         <title>Modulating Helix&#8208;Preference of an Axially&#8208;Twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) undergoes subtle differences in the stereochemical orientations on enantioselective interaction with stereoisomers of tartaric acid (TA), generating diverse spectroscopic outcomes to permit naked&#8208;eye enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Herein, we designed a chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral trans&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. R,R&#8208;ATMS exclusively adopted M&#8208;helicity and produced differential response in UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked&#8208;eye detection and enantiomeric content determination.

     alt="Modulating Helix-Preference of an Axially-Twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral, axially-twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) undergoes subtle differences in the stereochemical orientations on enantioselective interaction with stereoisomers of tartaric acid (TA), generating diverse spectroscopic outcomes to permit naked-eye enantio-discrimination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we designed a chiral, axially-twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-ATMS exclusively adopted &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-helicity and produced differential response in UV-vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked-eye detection and enantiomeric content determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers - while loss of CD signal at 345&#8197;nm was observed with equimolar &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-TA and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-TA, inversion was seen with equimolar &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-TA. Temperature increase weakened these interactions to partially recover the original CD signature of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-ATMS. 2D NMR studies also indicated the significant structural changes in &lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;-ATMS in the solution state upon addition of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-TA. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies on the crystals of the &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-ATMS&#8835;&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-TA salt revealed the interacting partners stacked in arrays and ATMS molecules stabilized by &#960;-&#960; stacking between its PDC and pyrene residues.

         <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzanellation of the N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) ligands in chromium complexes has impact on their reactivity, facilitating reduction to a radical anion, hydrogenation to a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, and Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P hydride mobility in a NHP&#8208;phosphine&#8208;hydride&#8208;complex formed by isomerization of the H2&#8208;complex. The latter reduces CO2 with formation of a formato complex, which is a key to mediate the transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol with NH3BH3.







Abstract
A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8722;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Pegylated Phosphine Ligands in Iridium(I) Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Buffers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pegylated phosphine as water&#8208;soluble ligand in iridium(i) catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions. The new catalyst was studied in HIE reactions in buffers and protic solvents. We found that solvent and pH had a strong impact on the two occurring HIE processes.







Abstract
The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insights into the catalytic processes. The scope and limitation of the pegylated catalyst was studied in HIE reactions of several complex compounds in borax buffer at pH&#8197;9 and the best conditions were applied in a tritium experiment with the drug telmisartan.

         <title>Multi Stimuli Responsive Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Photochromic Behavior of a Tetraphenyl Substituted Triphenylamine Derivative and its Application as Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted polyaromatic luminescent systems are well known for their AIE behavior and this AIE feature is exploited for a wide variety of applications. In this work, a new tetraphenyl substituted triphenylamine moiety is coupled with spiropyran and the final compound furnished both photochromism, acidochromism, and AIE behavior which was used to afford anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for versatile response under different wavelength of light.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive tetraphenyl substituted tripehnylamine&#8208;based aggregation induced emissive (AIE) material coupled with spiropyran was prepared. Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes. The fluorogenic and photogenic response under UV and visible light established the potential of the candidate as a new generation encryption material.

         <title>A Prebiotic Pathway to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation is the key in the prebiotic synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: NAD+ is obtained under prebiotic conditions by formation of nicotinamide riboside from ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal, glycol aldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Regioselective phosphorylation and use of light activated AMP yields NAD+ in a continuous formation process.







Abstract
Enzymes play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A wide range of enzymes require the presence of complementary coenzymes and cofactors to function properly. While coenzymes are believed to have been part of the last universal ancestor (LUCA) or have been present even earlier, the syntheses of crucial coenzymes like the redox&#8208;active coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) remain challenging. Here, we present a pathway to NAD+ under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal and sugar&#8208;forming precursors, yielding in&#8197;situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation&#8208;controlled formation of NAD+. Our findings indicate that NAD+, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non&#8208;enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of higher acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Predictive Modelling and Natural Product&#8208;based Divergent Synthesis &#8211; Design of Type B PPAPs with Nanomolar Activities against MRSA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In response to antibiotic resistance, a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach was used to synthesize 30 new type B PPAPs for SAR studies against MRSA. AI&#8208;trained 3D&#8208;QSAR models based on cellular assay data, were used to screen a virtual compound, and the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. Significant anti&#8208;MRSA activity at nanomolar concentration was demonstrated by these novel PPAPs.







Abstract
In response to the pressing global challenge of antibiotic resistance, time efficient design and synthesis of novel antibiotics are of immense need. Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP) were previously reported to effectively combat a range of gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Although the exact mode of action is still not clear, we conceptualized a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach to expand our natural product&#8208;based PPAP library by 30 additional entities to perform SAR studies against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although at this point only data from cellular assays are available and understanding of molecular drug&#8208;target interactions are lacking, the experimental data were used to generate 3D&#8208;QSAR models via an artificial intelligence training and to identify a common pharmacophore model. The experimentally validated QSAR model enabled the estimation of anti&#8208;MRSA activities of a virtual compound library consisting of more than 100,000 in&#8208;silico generated B PPAPs, out of which the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. These novel PPAPs revealed significantly improved cellular activities against MRSA with growth inhibition down to concentrations less than 1&#8197;&#956;m.

         <title>A Schottky/Z&#8208;Scheme Hybrid for Augmented Photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MCNRBO Schottky/Z&#8208;scheme ternary hybrid possessing shortened charge transfer resistance along with improved separation efficiency and abundant charged species demonstrated stupendous photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production.







Abstract
The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.

         <dc:description>
The rhodium/Me&#8208;ferrocelane&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenyl alcohols is reported. It provides selective access to 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered cyclic allyl ethers, scaffolds found in a large variety of pharmaceutical interesting and bioactive (natural) products. The gram scale preparation and functionalizations of the thus obtained product were demonstrated. Finally, we applied our novel method in a 2nd generation total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol improving the overall efficiency significantly (9 steps in total and 38&#8201;% yield for chiral chromane building block).







Abstract
We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium&#8208; catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;&#8208;vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol, we accomplished a significantly improved 2nd generation synthesis of the chromane building providing a total number of 13 steps and an overall total yield of 27&#8201;%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium- catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;-vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Me-ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&#945;-tocopherol, we accomplished a significantly improved 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; generation synthesis of the chromane building providing a total number of 13 steps and an overall total yield of 27&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Part Per Million Levels of Cobalt&#8208;Salen Complexes in Hydrosilylation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is developed for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds and corresponding secondary alcohols through the hydrosilylation of ketones utilizing ppm levels of inexpensive Cobalt&#8208;Salen complex. The developed reaction protocol features a broad substrate scope coupled with good selectivity, excellent turnover number (up to 2,00,000), applicability in gram scale synthesis and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A series of air&#8208;stable cobalt(III)salen complexes Co&#8208;1 to Co&#8208;4 have been synthesized and employed in the hydrosilylation of ketones. Notably, the most intricately tailored Co&#8208;3 pre&#8208;catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions. The developed catalytic hydrosilylation protocol proceeded with an unusual ppm level (5&#8197;ppm) catalyst loading of Co&#8208;3 and achieved a maximum turnover number (TON) of 200,000. A wide variety of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ketones encompassing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were successfully transformed into the desired silyl ethers or secondary alcohols in moderate to excellent yields.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride (BF2) complexes with asymmetrical N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands have demonstrated fascinating properties and found broad applications in various fields. They are generally constructed in two steps: ligand formation, followed by boron complexation. Herein, we categorize BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps.

This review focuses on categorizing these BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps. The post&#8208;functionalization, properties and applications of different types of BF2 complexes are presented. Their challenges and opportunities are also discussed. This should help the future rational design and synthesis of BF2 complexes with intriguing properties and practical applications.

         <title>Redox Active Ligands for Catalyzing the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single reduction of boron subphthalocyanines and antimony corroles is sufficient for the conversion of protons to hydrogen in a catalytic process that involves only the macrocyclic ligands in the redox events. The proton&#8208;activation step involves the peripheral N and meso&#8208;C atoms of the former and latter complexes, respectively.







Abstract
Boron subphthalocyanines with chloride and fluoride axial ligands and three antimony complexes chelated by corroles that differ in size and electron&#8208;richness were examined as electrocatalysts for reduction of protons to hydrogen. Experiment&#8208; and computation&#8208;based investigations revealed that all redox events are ligand&#8208;centered and that the meso&#8208;C of the corroles and the peripheral N atoms of the subphthalocyanines are the largely preferred proton&#8208;binding sites.

         <title>Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted Nitronyl Nitroxides: Comprehensive Magnetochemical and Quantum Chemical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of stable pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized. Magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established by XRD, magnetochemistry and quantum chemical calculations. Low&#8208;temperature XRD revealed phase transitions.







Abstract
A series of pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized and structurally characterized. A comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study of extended raw of the nitroxides with different substituents R in the pyridine fragment was performed. It was shown, that temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic properties are determined by the short contacts between nitroxide groups of adjacent molecules as well as between nitroxide group and methyl substituents in the pseudo axial positions of imidazoline fragments. Quantum chemistry allows to select the appropriate model of exchange cluster for analysis of experimental magnetic data and evaluation of the exchange interaction parameters. For NN&#8211;PyCl the &#8220;order&#8208;disorder&#8221; transition was detected by means of low temperature XRD. The difference in the experimental and calculated exchange interaction energies may serve as an indicator of temperature&#8208;induced structural rearrangements. For instance, for methyl substituted nitronyl nitroxide NN&#8208;PyMe structural transformations and significant changes in exchange interaction energies were observed.

         <title>Magnon Sensing of NO, NO2 and NH3 Gas Capture on CrSBr Monolayer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br vacancies in the surface of CrSBr allow the capture of NO, NO2, and NH3. The adsorption of these harmful gas species induces a frequency shift in the magnon spectra, which makes the 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr a candidate material for molecular sensors based on magnon sensing as an alternative to conventional electronic gas sensors.







Abstract
Air pollution and greenhouse emissions are significant problems across various sectors, urging the need for advanced technologies to detect and capture harmful gases. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing attention due to their large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and reactivity. Herein, we investigate the potential of single&#8208;layer CrSBr for gas sensing and capturing by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. We explore the adsorption behaviour of different pollutant gases (H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, CO and CO2) on this 2D ferromagnet and the impact of intrinsic defects on its magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that Br vacancies enhance the adsorption of NH3, NO and NO2 and induce a selective frequency shift on the magnon dispersion. This work motivates the creation of novel magnonic gas sensing devices based on 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.

Why is dihydrogen activation with frustrated Lewis pairs based on tetrahedral Lewis acids that intricate? This study answers the question by means of a statistical analysis of an ensemble of &lt;1500 encounter complexes. It reveals that the formation of &#8220;active&#8221; EC is far less likely for tetrahedral Lewis acids compared to trigonal Lewis acids, slowing down dihydrogen splitting despite similar transition state energies.







Abstract
Dihydrogen activation is the paradigmatic reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). While trigonal&#8208;planar Lewis acids have been well established in this transformation, tetrahedral Lewis acids are surprisingly limited. Indeed, several cases were computed as thermodynamically and kinetically feasible but exhibit puzzling discrepancies with experimental results. In the present study, a computational investigation of the factors influencing dihydrogen activation are considered by large ensemble sampling of encounter complexes, deformation energies and the activation strain model for a silicon/nitrogen FLP and compared with a boron/phosphorous FLP. The analysis adds the previously missing dimension of Lewis acids&#8217; structural flexibility as a factor that influences preexponential terms beyond pure transition state energies. It sheds light on the origin of &#8220;overfrustration&#8221; (defined herein), indicates structural constraint in Lewis acids as a linchpin for activation of weak donor substrates, and allows drawing a more refined mechanistic picture of this emblematic reactivity.

         <dc:description>
This study shows how intermolecular interactions in a solid can deform a seemingly rigid molecule. It is one of the rare cases where a series of structural determinations in the crystalline phase and a highly reliable structural determination in the gaseous state by electron diffraction are available. As a heavy element containing structure of a free molecule it can also serve as a reference for the evaluation and development of quantum chemical methods.







Abstract
The geometric and electronic structure of [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 (1) in the gas phase, i.&#8201;e. free of intermolecular interactions, was determined by a synchronous gas&#8208;phase electron diffraction/mass spectrometry experiment (GED/MS), complemented by quantum chemical calculations. 1 is stable up to 498&#8197;K and the gas phase contains a single molecular form: the trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3. It has a planar structure of D3h symmetry with a Hg&#8211;C distance of 2.075(5)&#8197;&#197; and a Hg&#8211;Hg distance of 3.614(7)&#8197;&#197; (both rh1). Structural differences between the crystalline and gaseous state have been analyzed. Different DFT functional&#8208;basis combinations were tested, demonstrating the importance to consider the relativistic effects of the mercury atoms. The combination PBE0/MWB(Hg),cc&#8208;pVTZ(C,F) turned out to be the most appropriate for the geometry optimization of such organomercurials. The electronic structure of 1, the nature of the chemical bonding in C&#8722;Hg&#8722;C fragments and the nature of the Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions have been analyzed in terms of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approaches. The influence of the nature of halogen substitution on the structure of the molecules in the series [Hg(o&#8208;C6H4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Cl4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Br4)]3 was also analyzed.

         <title>Evolutionary Abilities of Minimalistic Physicochemical Models of Life Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autocatalytic cycles constituted solely of unstable chemical intermediates (represented with asterisks) can in principle exist in a state of Dynamic Kinetic Stability (DKS). These Emerging Autonomous Systems (EASs) feature properties of living organisms and can emerge as well as they can &#8220;die&#8221;. They may constitute primordial systems able to initiate a process of selection anticipating natural selection.







Abstract
The ability of living organisms to persist, grow, evolve and invade environments seemingly challenges physical laws. Emerging Autonomous Systems representing autocatalytic cycles constituted of energized components in a state of Dynamic Kinetic Stability feature some of these properties. These simple theoretical models can grow, can be transferred but need an initiation to emerge and can collapse. Moreover, they can undergo kinetic selection in a way consistent with Darwinian behaviour, though they lack the ability to undergo change. The mere existence of these systems and their open&#8208;ended growth potential are proposed to constitute a transmissible factor of a non&#8208;coded kind. The onset and selection of epigenetic factors may therefore have preceded that of genetic polymers. Here is addressed the question of how these systems may arise from the diversity exhibited by abiotic organic matter, sometimes associated with intractable mixtures, which may actually be useful in providing initiators. The Darwinian description of evolution may therefore be merged without critical discontinuity within an origin scenario. Accordingly, such a theory would rests solely on physicochemical laws beginning with the potential of emerging autonomous systems to compete and invade the space dimension, and to further develop along other available dimensions including variability and, possibly, cognition.

         <title>In situ reconstructured alloy nanosheets heterojunction for highly selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35 mA cm&#8208;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction. Cu6Sn5 nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu2O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ce(IV) Heteroleptic Double&#8208;Decker Complex with a New Helical Naphthalocyanine as a Potential Gearing Subunit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolytes for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries: Progress and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), as electrochemical energy storage technologies, are advantageous because of their high theoretical specific capacity, lightweightness, zero pollution, safety, inexpensiveness, and abundant resources, which make them recent research hot spots. However, their electrolyte issues significantly limit their commercialization. The electrolyte choices for AIBs are significantly limited, and most of the available choices do not facilitate the three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reaction of Al3+/Al. Thus, this review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes, as well as modification strategies for AIBs, to clarify the limitations of existing AIB electrolytes and offer guidance for improving their performances. Furthermore, the advantages as well as limitations and possible solutions for each electrolyte are discussed, after which the future of AIB electrolytes is envisioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetric Aromatic Amidoalkylations of Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylene derivatives are highly investigated for their electronic, supramolecular and photophysical properties, but the direct modification of the central aromatic core is particularly challenging especially in the internal positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12. Herein we present an efficient alkylation method of 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexasubstituted triphenylene derivatives leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric derivatives in good yields using N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)carboxamide or N&#8208;(alkoxylmethyl)carboxamide alkylating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>[5]Molecular Necklaces Formed Through Zn2+&#8208;Templated Binding of Macrocycles to Dynamically Formed Imines as Guest Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate an &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy for assembling interlocked molecules through dynamic imine formation, &#8220;establishing&#8221; the host recognition sites in situ. Using Zn2+ ions to template the assembly of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycle with semidumbbell&#8208;shaped triazole&#8208;containing aldehyde and amine derivatives, we obtained the corresponding [2]rotaxane in high yield (85%) after subsequent imine reduction (NaBH4) and amine protonation (NH4PF6). We performed the same three steps (assembly, reduction, protonation) to prepare a stable and highly symmetrical [5]molecular necklace ([5]MN) from 12 components (two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, four Zn2+ ions) in an overall yield of 69%.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative NHC and Photoredox Catalyzed Radical Aminoacylation of Alkenes to Tetrahydropyridazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyridazines constitute an important structural motif found in numerous natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report an&#160;aminoacylation reaction of alkenes that enables the synthesis of&#160;1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and photoredox catalysis. This approach involves the&#160;6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig&#160;cyclization of&#160;N&#8208;centered&#160;hydrazonyl radicals, generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of hydrazones, followed by a radical&#8211;radical coupling step.&#160;The mild process tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and affords a variety of&#160;tetrahydropyridazines&#160;in moderate to high yields. Preliminary investigations using chiral NHC catalysts demonstrate the potential of this protocol for asymmetric radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction: a Practical Method to Synthesize Trans&#8208;Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio&#8208;active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling cis&#8208;trans selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing gem&#8208;bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to trans&#8208;olefins via intramolecular O&#8211;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great trans&#8208;selectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on intermediate trapping experiments, isotope labelling studies, and kinetic analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8203;Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenom of (+)&#8208; and (&#8208;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#8203;Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co-assembled CPL-active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host-guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single-handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;-CD-based host-guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;-CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single-handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenom of (+)- and (-)-circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;-CD, arising from right- and left-handed stacking conformations, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indole Nucleophile Triggers Mechanistic Divergence in Ni&#8208;Photoredox N&#8211;Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a Ni&#8208;photoredox method for indole N&#8208;arylation, broadening the range of substrates to include indoles with unprotected C3&#8208;positions and base&#8208;sensitive groups. Through detailed mechanistic inquiries, a Ni(I/III) mechanism was uncovered, distinct from those commonly proposed for Ni&#8208;catalyzed amine, thiol, and alcohol arylation, as well as from the Ni(0/II/III) cycle identified for amide arylation under almost identical conditions. The key finding is the formation of a Ni(I) intermediate bearing the indole nucleophile as a ligand prior to oxidative addition, which is rare for Ni&#8208;photoredox carbon&#8208;heteroatom coupling and has a profound impact on the reaction kinetics and scope. The pre&#8208;coordination of indole renders a more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) intermediate, which broadens the scope by enabling fast reactivity even with challenging electron&#8208;rich aryl bromide substrates. Thus, this work highlights the often&#8208;overlooked influence of X&#8208;type ligands on Ni oxidative addition rates and illustrates yet another mechanistic divergence in Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8211;heteroatom couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations:

On the role of local charge polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10 nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8208;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced electrochemical performance of NiMn layered double hydroxides/graphene oxide composites synthesized by one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study aims to enhance the performance of supercapacitors, focusing particularly on optimizing electrode materials. While pure NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, they have limitations in achieving high specific capacitance. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesized composite materials of NiMn LDHs with varying loadings of graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal method. Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096 F g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 current density and 1471 F g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1, when GO doping level was 0.45 wt%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3% capacitance at 5 A g&#8208;1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Postsynthetic Modification of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks can be finely tailored to achieve specific properties through postsynthetic modification. Three approaches in terms of postsynthetic modification of the building blocks, the guests, and the connection modes between the building blocks were highlighted, which exert a profound influence on the framework structures and subsequently induce alterations in flexibility, luminescence, electrochemistry, and chirality.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks have garnered significant attention due to their flexible structures with tailored porosity, making them a promising class of porous framework materials. However, the direct synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with specific functions is highly challenging due to the unpredictable formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks. In response, postsynthetic modification has emerged as a potent strategy to imbue desired functions into hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks. Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of postsynthetic modification in hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for studying their mechanical, luminescent, electrochemical, and chiral properties. In this concept, we comprehensively summarize the methodologies and outcomes of postsynthetic modification to hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, providing a highlight of this exciting research area.

         <title>Molecular Hosts for the Sensing and Separation of 99TcO4&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective recognition and separation of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and environmental remediation efforts. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This Concept article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation from aqueous solutions using molecular hosts.







Abstract
In recent years, European Union member states have hastened energy policy deliberations to address supply and sustainability concerns, placing a significant emphasis on nuclear energy as a means to achieve decarbonization goals. However, despite its significant role in power generation, nuclear energy faces significant challenges linked to fuel reprocessing and waste disposal, that hinder its broader expansion. In this context, the separation of technetium represents a concerning issue. Indeed, technetium&#8216;s catalytic activity can impede the extraction of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium, affecting waste reprocessing efficiency. Additionally, the stable form of technetium in aerobic conditions, pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;), poses risks of groundwater contamination due to its mobility and solubility. Hence, sensing and separation of TcO4&#8722; is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and minimising radioactive contamination in the environment. However, the binding of TcO4&#8722; and its separation from contaminated solutions present challenges due to the acidic (or basic) waste components and the high ionic strength in real matrices. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation (using extraction and sorption) with a focus on molecular hosts. Metal&#8208;organic receptors will also be discussed.

The effective luminescence of aggregates demonstrates excellent photophysical properties that are distinct from the &#8220;isolated&#8221; monomer and offers feasible solution for aggregated&#8208;caused quenching problem, which facilitates realizing outstanding electroluminescent performance. Here, highly efficient OLEDs based on aggregated emitters with different luminescent mechanisms achieved through intermolecular interactions modulation are highlighted.







Abstract
The adverse aggregated&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem of most electroluminescent materials existing in highly doped thin films is one of the key factors impeding the commercialization of high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) panel. Whereas, by delicately constructing and modulating moderate intermolecular interactions, some aggregates have been demonstrated to present distinct luminescent properties such as tunable emission spectra, improved photoluminescence quantum yields, different emission mechanism and enhanced horizontal transition dipole ratio (&#920;) of emitting layer, providing feasible solution for ACQ problem. The luminescence from newly generated emissive state in aggregates is different from the traditional &#8220;isolated&#8221; molecules in organic electronics and will possess novel properties and applications. Herein, we summarize the different types of intermolecular interactions within emitter aggregates exhibiting distinct luminescent mechanisms, as well as their effects on photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties, offering reliable reference for the advancement of highly efficient OLEDs utilizing aggregated emitters.

         <title>The Mechanism of Guerbet Reaction by Metal Ligand Cooperation Catalyst Mn&#8208;PCP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>

DFT study provides insights into the mechanism of Guerbet reaction by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation catalyst Mn&#8208;PCP. The selectivity and the electronic effect of the carbanion PCP ligand on the Guerbet reaction were elucidated.







Abstract
The Guerbet reaction is important for the synthesis of longer&#8208;chain monoalcohols like isobutanol through catalytic transfer hydrogenation from short&#8208;chain methanol and ethanol. However, the mechanism becomes complicated, especially considering the variations in the different metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) catalysts used. In order to further understand the Guerbet reaction, DFT studies were performed to figure out the detailed mechanism initiated by the unique Mn&#8208;PCP MLC Catalyst. Our results suggest that even with the assistance of the carbanion site of the PCP ligand, the direct substitution mechanism is less favored than the condensation&#8208;reduction mechanism. The key step of the reaction is the final reduction of the carbonyl, in which the 1,4&#8208;reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde is prior to the 3,4&#8208;reduction or 1,2&#8208;reduction due to the stronger interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. It is found that the production of isobutanol is preferred over n&#8208;butanol because of the lower total free energy barrier and lower relative free energy of the product. Finally, by changing the electronic effect of the carbanion site of the catalyst, we found that the relation between the electronic effect and the highest free energy span was not monotonous and a point with optimal electronic effect exists numerically.

         <title>Selective Transition Enhancement in a g&#8208;Engineered Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diradical formed by functionalizing the yttrium(III)&#8208;phthalocyaninato radical with a nitroxide radical, is characterized by an engineered g&#8208;tensor asymmetry and a weak exchange coupling. Interestingly, its behavior is reminiscent of a spin qutrit, exhibiting two EPR transitions characterized by different Rabi frequencies and whose amplitudes can be selectively enhanced by proper choice of microwave power or magnetic field.







Abstract
A diradical with engineered g&#8208;asymmetry was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#8901; radical platform. Various spectroscopic techniques and computational studies revealed that the electronic structures of the two spin systems remained minimally affected within the diradical system. Fluid&#8208;solution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments revealed a weak exchange coupling with |J| ~ 0.014&#8197;cm&#8722;1, subsequently rationalized by CAS&#8208;SCF calculations. Frozen solution continuous&#8208;wave (CW) EPR experiments showed a complicated and power&#8208;dependent spectrum that eluded analysis using the point&#8208;dipole model. Pulse EPR manipulations with varying microwave powers, or under varying magnetic fields, demonstrated that different resonances could be selectively enhanced or suppressed, based on their different tipping angles. In particular, Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra revealed absorptions of MW power&#8208;dependent intensities, while Field&#8208;Swept Spin Nutation (FSSN) experiments revealed two distinct Rabi frequencies. This study introduces a methodology to synthesize and characterize g&#8208;asymmetric two&#8208;spin systems, of interest in the implementation of spin&#8208;based CNOT gates.

         <dc:description>
Novel quinazoline&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks were synthesized via a multiple&#8208;component reaction. These COFs possessed enhanced chemical stability and showed high activity for catalysing the photooxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Quinazoline (Qz)&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been constructed via a three&#8208;component reaction of ortho&#8208;acylanilines, benzaldehydes and NH4OAc. The structure of Qz&#8208;COFs has been confirmed by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. The Qz&#8208;COFs possess high chemical stability, showing good endurance to strong acid, strong base, oxidant, reductant and other conditions. Particularly, Qz&#8208;COF&#8208;3 can catalyze the aerobic photooxidation of toluene and other compounds containing C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and simple mechanical bond strategy can significantly enhance the fluorescence of pyrenes in the solid state with a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect. More importantly, it is found that the originally impure emission of pyrene can be purified to a single emission after the modification of mechanical bond.







Abstract
To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from ACQ to AIE effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. Moreover, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterisation, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from mechanical bond induced refinement of molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Identification of Potential Drug Targets of Calix[4]arene by Reverse Docking</title>

A rational approach, was applied to design protein inhibitors using the calix[4]arene as molecular scaffold. By screening a database of druggable proteins with a reverse docking procedure, we identified and discussed many proteins of pharmaceutical interest.







Abstract
Calixarenes are displaying great potential for the development of new drug delivery systems, diagnostic imaging, biosensing devices and inhibitors of biological processes. In particular, calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes and function as inhibitors. By screening of the potential drug target database (PDTD) with a reverse docking procedure, we identify and discuss a selection of 100 proteins that interact strongly with calix[4]arene. We also discover that leucine (23.5&#8201;%), isoleucine (11.3&#8201;%), phenylalanines (11.3&#8201;%) and valine (9.5&#8201;%) are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines and aromatic histidines, tyrosines and tryptophanes. Top binders are peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptors that already are targeted by commercial drugs, demonstrating the practical interest in calix[4]arene. Nuclear receptors, potassium channel, several carrier proteins, a variety of cancer&#8208;related proteins and viral proteins are prominent in the list. It is concluded that calix[4]arene, which is characterized by facile access, well&#8208;defined conformational characteristics, and ease of functionalization at both the lower and higher rims, could be a potential lead compound for the development of enzyme inhibitors and theranostic platforms.

         <title>Migration of Condensed Aromatic Hydrocarbons During Alkyne&#8208;Vinylidene Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkyne&#8208;vinylidene rearrangement was applied on internal alkynes featuring sterically demanding condensed aromatics, such as phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and ferrocene, reaching yields of up to 99&#8201;% of the resulting vinylidene complexes. Buried Volume analysis showed that the number of flanking hydrogens rather than electronic properties impact the performance of the substrates.







Abstract
Diarylacetylenes ArC&#8801;CAr featuring condensed aromatic hydrocarbon fragments (Ar) such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene were converted into vinylidene ligands by 1,2&#8208;migration reactions within the coordination sphere of half&#8208;sandwich complexes [MII(dppe)Cp]+ (MII = RuII, FeII). Comparison of the extent of conversion of the alkyne substrates to the vinylidene complexes [Ru{=C=CAr2}(dppe)Cp]+ with those obtained from acetylenes functionalized by smaller groups (H, CH3, Ph) show that the molecular volume (VM) of the migrating group and relief of steric congestion plays a role during the rearrangement process. Conversely, the H&#8208;atoms from the larger condensed ring aryl groups that are in close proximity to the migrating sites also have a significant influence on the efficacy and extent of the reaction by restricting access of the alkyne to the metal center, resulting in a less effective migration reaction. This combination of competing steric factors (acceleration due to relief of steric congestion and restricted access of the alkyne moiety to the reaction site) is exemplified by the facile migration of 1&#8208;pyryl entities and the low yields of vinylidene products formed from 1,2&#8208;bis(9&#8208;anthryl)acetylene.

         <title>Redox Properties of Mn(III)porphyrins in Hyaluronan Oxidative Degradation: Single Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2O2 is decomposed by para Mn(III)porphyrins, so the initiation of hyaluronan degradation is inhibited. The complexed Mn(III) ion is reduced to Mn(II) ions by H2O2, which oxidizes to oxygen. The propagation phase of hyaluronan degradation is stopped since the intermediate peroxyl&#8208;type of hyaluronan molecules are reduced to alcohol&#8208;type products, while the complexed Mn(III) ions oxidize to the oxidation state +4.







Abstract
Cationic Mn(III)&#8208;meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin derivatives, substituted in para position with different size alkyl chains, were investigated to function as antioxidants in free&#8208;radical degradation of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass hyaluronan by the methods of rotational viscometry and oximetry. The results of rotational viscometry showed that MnTM&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ showed high efficiency in decomposing H2O2, and reducing of peroxidized hyaluronan. When using oxygen electrode, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ applied to function as protective antioxidants in hyaluronan degradation, the uptake of dissolved oxygen from the reaction milieu was rapid, followed by continual increase in oxygen concentration up to the end of the measurement. However, when especially MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ were examined as hyaluronan chain&#8208;breaking antioxidants, after short&#8208;term dissolved oxygen uptake, almost no increase in oxygen concentration was shown.

Abstract
A first metal&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of allylic sulfones featuring aldehyde functionality at the &#948;&#8208;position has been reported. The formation of structurally complex &#948;,&#948;&#8208;dimethoxy allylic sulfones is enabled by the direct nucleophilic attack of methoxide onto the sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes.

         <title>&#8216;Passivated Precursor&#8217; Approach to All&#8208;Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters and Total Structure Determination of Au130</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach for all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters, which consists of direct reduction and chromatography separation, and gives a series of clusters including Au22, Au36, Au44, Au130 and Au144. Notably, the overall yields are 40&#8201;%. In addition, total structure determination of Au130 has been achieved.







Abstract
A &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach is developed for the efficient synthesis and isolation of all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters. Direct reduction of dpa&#8208;passivated precursor Au&#8208;dpa (Hdpa=2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridylamine) in one&#8208;pot under ambient conditions gives a series of clusters including Au22(C&#8801;CR)18 (R=&#8722;C6H4&#8722;2&#8722;F), Au36(C&#8801;CR)24, Au44(C&#8801;CR)28, Au130(C&#8801;CR)50, and Au144(C&#8801;CR)60. These clusters can be well separated via column chromatography. The overall isolation yield of this series of clusters is 40&#8201;% (based on gold), which is much improved in comparison with previous approaches. It is notable that the molecular structure of the giant cluster Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 is revealed, which presents important information for understanding the structure of the mysterious Au130 nanoclusters. Theoretical calculations indicated Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 has a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap than Au130(S&#8722;C6H4&#8722;4&#8722;CH3)50. This facile and reliable synthetic approach will greatly accelerate further studies on all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters.

&lt;p&gt;We present here a &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach for all-alkynyl-protected gold nanoclusters, which consists of direct reduction and chromatography separation, and gives a series of clusters including &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;144&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Notably, the overall yields are 40&#8201;%. In addition, total structure determination of &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; has been achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach is developed for the efficient synthesis and isolation of all-alkynyl-protected gold nanoclusters. Direct reduction of dpa-passivated precursor Au-dpa (Hdpa=2,2&#8217;-dipyridylamine) in one-pot under ambient conditions gives a series of clusters including Au&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; (R=&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;2&#8722;F), Au&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, Au&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;, Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, and Au&lt;sub&gt;144&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. These clusters can be well separated via column chromatography. The overall isolation yield of this series of clusters is 40&#8201;% (based on gold), which is much improved in comparison with previous approaches. It is notable that the molecular structure of the giant cluster Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed, which presents important information for understanding the structure of the mysterious Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters. Theoretical calculations indicated Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap than Au&lt;sub&gt;130&lt;/sub&gt;(S&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;4&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. This facile and reliable synthetic approach will greatly accelerate further studies on all-alkynyl-protected gold nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cationic half&#8208;sandwich zinc complexes containing chelating amines [Cp*Zn(Ln)][BAr4F] (Cp*=&#951;3&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine; Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraethylethylenediamine,; Cp*=&#951;1&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine,; Ar4F=(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4) reacted with dihydrogen in THF to give molecular zinc hydride cations [(Ln)ZnH(thf)m][BAr4F] (m=0, 1) along with Cp*H. Pseudo first&#8208;order kinetics with zinc cation concentration suggests heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen by the Zn&#8722;Cp* bond.







Abstract
Cationic half&#8208;sandwich zinc complexes containing chelating amines [Cp*Zn(Ln)][BAr4F] (2&#8201;a, Cp*=&#951;3&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, TMEDA; 2&#8201;b, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraethylethylenediamine, TEEDA; 2&#8201;c, Cp*=&#951;1&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, PMDTA; Ar4F=(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4) reacted with dihydrogen (ca. 2&#8197;bar) in THF at 80&#8201;&#176;C to give molecular zinc hydride cations [(Ln)ZnH(thf)m][BAr4F] (3&#8201;a,b, m=1; 3&#8201;c, m=0) previously reported along with Cp*H. Pseudo first&#8208;order kinetics with respect to the concentration of 2&#8201;b suggests heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen by the Zn&#8722;Cp* bond, reminiscent of &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. Hydrogenolysis of the zinc cation 2&#8201;b in the presence of benzophenone gave the zinc alkoxide [(TEEDA)Zn(OCHPh2)(thf)][BAr4F] (5&#8201;b). Cation 2&#8201;b was shown to catalytically hydrogenate N&#8208;benzylideneaniline. The PMDTA complex 2&#8201;c underwent C&#8722;H bond activation in acetonitrile to give a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;&#954;C,&#954;N&#8208;cyanomethyl zinc complex [(PMDTA)Zn(CH2CN)]2[BAr4F]2 (6&#8201;c).

         <title>A Systematic Study of Nonionic Di&#8208; and Multiborane Catalysts for the Oligomerization and Polymerization of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screening of 13 different di&#8208; and multiborane polymerization catalysts is conducted, investigating the effect of factors such as linker length and linker flexibility on epoxide oligomerization and polymerization. A promising catalyst based on a biphenyl backbone is identified, which is tolerant towards excess hydroxyl groups and enables long&#8208;lived (&gt;50&#8197;days) and controlled oligomerization as well as efficient polymerization.







Abstract
Borane catalysis has emerged as a powerful technology in epoxide polymerization. Still, the structure&#8208;activity correlations for these catalysts are not fully understood to date, especially regarding compounds with nonionic backbones. Thus, in this work, 13 different borane catalysts of this respective type are described and investigated for their epoxide oligomerization and polymerization performance, using propylene oxide (PO), 1&#8208;butylene oxide (BO) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) as monomers. Structurally, special emphasis is put on catalysts with different linker lengths and linker flexibilities as well as the introduction of more than two borane functionalities. Importantly, this screening is conducted both under typical polymerization conditions as well as under the chain transfer agent (CTA)&#8208;rich conditions relevant for large&#8208;scale production. It is found that suitable preorganization of the borane groups, such as present in biphenyl derivatives, offers a simple route to high&#8208;performing catalysts and quantitative monomer conversion of the investigated epoxides. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a diborane&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization can be kept active over weeks, whereby repeated addition of monomer batches (14 steps) constantly results in full conversion and well&#8208;defined oligoethers, underlining the practical potential of this method. The absence of co&#8208;initiating counter ions is suggested as an inherent advantage of nonionic catalysts.

         <title>Characterization of Germanium Nanoparticles from Arylgermanium Trihydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>

o&#8208;tolylgermanium trihydride undergoes dehydrogenative coupling to form a germanium nanoparticle with o&#8208;tolyl termination. The particles are about 2&#8211;6&#8197;nm in size and have intense orange to red coloration.







Abstract
Germanium is a promising basis for nanomaterials due to its low toxicity and valuable optical and electronic properties. However, germanium nanomaterials have seen little research compared to other group 14 elements due to unpredictable chemical behavior and high costs. Here, we report the dehydrocoupling of o&#8208;tolylgermanium trihydride to amorphous nanoparticles. The reaction is facilitated through reflux at 162&#8201;&#176;C and can be accelerated with an amine base catalyst. Through cleavage of both H2 and toluene, new Ge&#8722;Ge bonds form. This results in nanoparticles consisting of crosslinked germanium with o&#8208;tolyl termination. The particles are 2&#8211;6&#8197;nm in size and have masses above approximately 3500&#8197;Da. The organic substituents are promising for further functionalization.

     alt="Characterization of Germanium Nanoparticles from Arylgermanium Trihydrides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tolylgermanium trihydride undergoes dehydrogenative coupling to form a germanium nanoparticle with &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tolyl termination. The particles are about 2&#8211;6&#8197;nm in size and have intense orange to red coloration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germanium is a promising basis for nanomaterials due to its low toxicity and valuable optical and electronic properties. However, germanium nanomaterials have seen little research compared to other group 14 elements due to unpredictable chemical behavior and high costs. Here, we report the dehydrocoupling of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tolylgermanium trihydride to amorphous nanoparticles. The reaction is facilitated through reflux at 162&#8201;&#176;C and can be accelerated with an amine base catalyst. Through cleavage of both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and toluene, new Ge&#8722;Ge bonds form. This results in nanoparticles consisting of crosslinked germanium with &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tolyl termination. The particles are 2&#8211;6&#8197;nm in size and have masses above approximately 3500&#8197;Da. The organic substituents are promising for further functionalization. Combined with strong absorption up to 600&#8197;nm and moderate solubility and air stability, there are numerous possibilities for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Transition Control in Molecular Solids via Complementarity of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we highlight a phase transition driven by H&#8208;bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase&#8208;transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.







Abstract
Phase transitions in molecular solids involve synergistic changes in chemical and electronic structures, leading to diversification in physical and chemical properties. Despite the pivotal role of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in many phase&#8208;transition materials, it is rare and challenging to chemically regulate the dynamics and to elucidate the structure&#8208;property relationship. Here, four high&#8208;spin CoII compounds were isolated and systematically investigated by modifying the ligand terminal groups (X=S, Se) and substituents (Y=Cl, Br). S&#8722;Cl and Se&#8722;Br undergo a reversible structural phase transition near room temperature, triggering the rotation of 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 guests and the swing between syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation of NCX&#8722; ligands, accompanied by switchable magnetism. Conversely, S&#8722;Br and Se&#8722;Cl retain stability in ordered and disordered phases, respectively. H&#8208;bonds geometric analysis and ab initio calculations reveal that the electronegativity of X and Y affects the strength of NY&#8208;ap&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. Entropy&#8208;driven structural phase transitions occur when the H&#8208;bond strength is appropriate; otherwise, the phase stays unchanged if it is too strong or weak. This work highlights a phase transition driven by H&#8208;bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase&#8208;transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.

         <title>On the Electrochemical Growth of a Crystalline p&#8211;n Junction From Aqueous Solutions</title>

Semiconductor junctions are the fundamental components of important electronic devices including transistors and photovoltaic cells. This work reports on an innovative and inexpensive method for obtaining semiconductor&#8208;based devices, particularly p&#8211;n junctions. Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition allows the sequential deposition of two different semiconductors from aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Our society largely relies on inorganic semiconductor devices which are, so far, fabricated using expensive and complex processes requiring ultra&#8208;high vacuum equipment. Here we report on the possibility of growing a p&#8211;n junction taking advantage of electrochemical processes based on the use of aqueous solutions. The growth of the junction has been carried out using the Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E&#8208;ALD) technique, which allowed to sequentially deposit two different semiconductors, CdS and Cu2S, on an Ag(111) substrate, in a single procedure. The growth process was monitored in&#8197;situ by Surface X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (SXRD) and resulted in the fabrication of a thin double&#8208;layer structure with a high degree of crystallographic order and a well&#8208;defined interface. The high&#8208;performance electrical characteristics of the device were analysed ex&#8208;situ and show the characteristic feature of a diode.

         <title>Helicene Appended Benzothiadiazoles as Chiral Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive covalently linked benzothiadiazole 4,7&#8208;bis(helicenes), with the [6]helicene representatives showing CPL activity in solution and in the solid state, have been obtained through a straightforward strategy.







Abstract
A homologous series of 4,7&#8208;bis(aryl) substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) compounds, containing the helicenic derivatives bis([4]helicene), bis([5]helicene) and bis([6]helicene), have been prepared upon a double Suzuki coupling between 3,6&#8208;bis(pinacolyl&#8208;borane)&#8208;BTD and the corresponding bromo&#8208;aryl precursors. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the bis([4]helicene) compound shows the existence of both helicities (M) and (P) on the same molecule. All the compounds of the series are highly emissive in solution, with quantum yields of the emission ranging from 50 to 91&#8201;%. The enantiopure compounds (M,M) and (P,P) for the BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene) have been prepared from the corresponding enantiopure 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;[6]helicene precursors. Their chiroptical properties have been investigated in correlation with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which allowed to confidently assign the absolute configuration of the helicene arms and to characterize the different electronic transitions, including the low energy charge transfer excitation from helicenes to BTD. The enantiomerically pure fluorophores (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene), which exist in solution as two main conformers, according to the DFT calculations, show CPL activity in solution, with glum factors of &#8776;1.7&#215;10&#8722;3 at &#955;em=525&#8197;nm, and also in the solid state, with glum factors of &#8776;1.2&#215;10&#8722;3 in spite of the strong decrease of the quantum efficiency.

         <title>Exploiting Mixed Valence Charge Transfer for Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Use</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsymmetric donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 was leveraged to decipher Class&#8208;II mixed valence charge transfer. This conjugated D&#8722;A&#8208;D fluorophore had a strong IVCT at 1500&#8197;nm upon chemical and electrochemical oxidation. This NIR absorption and fluorescence modulation were ideal for electro and eletrofluorochromics.







Abstract
An asymmetric mixed valence fluorophore with two different electron rich termini was investigated as a dual&#8208;role active material for electrochromism and electrofluorochromism. The fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;fl) and emission wavelength of the fluorophore were dependent on solvent polarity. The quantum yield of the material in an electrolyte gel, on a glass substrate and in a device was 40&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 13&#8201;% respectively. The fluorophore further underwent two near&#8208;simultaneous electrochemical oxidations. The first oxidation resulted in a 1000&#8197;nm red shift in the absorption to broadly absorb in the NIR, corresponding to the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT). Whereas the second oxidation led to a perceived green color at 715&#8197;nm with the extinction of the NIR absorbing IVCT. Owing to the dissymmetry of the fluorophore along with its two unique oxidation sites, the IVCT gives rise to a mixed valence transfer charge (MVCT). The coloration efficiency of the fluorophore in both solution and a device was 1433 and 200&#8197;cm2&#8201;C&#8722;1, respectively. The fluorescence intensity could be reversibly modulated electrochemically. The photoemission intensity of the fluorophore was modulated with applied potential in an operating electrochromic/electrofluorochromic device. Both the dual electrochromic and the electrofluorochromic behavior of the fluorophore were demonstrated.

The fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;) and emission wavelength of the fluorophore were dependent on solvent polarity. The quantum yield of the material in an electrolyte gel, on a glass substrate and in a device was 40&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 13&#8201;% respectively. The fluorophore further underwent two near-simultaneous electrochemical oxidations. The first oxidation resulted in a 1000&#8197;nm red shift in the absorption to broadly absorb in the NIR, corresponding to the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT). Whereas the second oxidation led to a perceived green color at 715&#8197;nm with the extinction of the NIR absorbing IVCT. Owing to the dissymmetry of the fluorophore along with its two unique oxidation sites, the IVCT gives rise to a mixed valence transfer charge (MVCT). The coloration efficiency of the fluorophore in both solution and a device was 1433 and 200&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The fluorescence intensity could be reversibly modulated electrochemically. The photoemission intensity of the fluorophore was modulated with applied potential in an operating electrochromic/electrofluorochromic device. Both the dual electrochromic and the electrofluorochromic behavior of the fluorophore were demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

3&#8208;(3&#8208;Hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol (PiQ) undergoes a distinct excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process and displays aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics in aqueous solutions. Leveraging the properties of PiQ, a photoluminescent probe, B&#8208;PiQ&#8208;A, is developed that can detect both exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in HeLa and RAW264 cells.







Abstract
Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules, which feature large Stokes shifts to avoid self&#8208;absorption, play an essential role in photoluminescent bioimaging probes. Herein, we report the development of an ESIPT molecule 3&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol (PiQ). PiQ not only undergoes a distinct ESIPT process unlike the symmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;diol but also exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. PiQ self&#8208;assembles into aggregates with an average size of 241.0&#177;51.9&#8197;nm in aqueous solutions, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence. On the basis of the ESIPT and AIE characteristics of PiQ, the latter is functionalized with a hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive 4&#8208;pinacoratoborylbenzyl group (B) and a carboxylesterase&#8208;responsive acetyl group (A) to produce a photoluminescent probe B&#8722;PiQ&#8722;A. The potential of PiQ for applications in bioimaging and chemical sensing is underscored by its efficient detection of both endogenous and exogenous hydrogen peroxide in living cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis and Recovery of Single Crystals of the Metastable Manganese Carbide, MnCx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal carbides are used widely throughout industry for their high hardness, superior resistance to corrosion, and stability under extremes of temperature and radiation. Here we describe the discovery of a novel sub&#8208;stoichiometric anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type compound, MnCx (P63/mmc), synthesized at pressures between ~5&#8211;10&#8197;GPa and recovered fully to ambient conditions as single crystals.







Abstract
Transition metal carbides find widespread use throughout industry due to their high strength and resilience under extreme conditions. However, they remain largely limited to compounds formed from the early d&#8208;block elements, since the mid&#8208;to&#8208;late transition metals do not form thermodynamically stable carbides. We report here the high&#8208;pressure bulk synthesis of large single crystals of a novel metastable manganese carbide compound, MnCx (P63/mmc), which adopts the anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type structure with significant substoichiometry at the carbon sites. We demonstrate how synthesis pressure modulates the carbon loading, with ~40&#8201;% occupancy being achieved at 9.9&#8197;GPa.

         <dc:description>
Gallylene supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide (Boxm) ligand was synthesized and structurally characterized. The reaction of this gallylene with triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide yielded dimeric gallium sulfide and selenide. These compounds could be converted to monomeric terminal sulfide and selenide by coordination of an external Lewis base such as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC or IMe4) and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridiene (DMAP). These doubly&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide reacted with phenyl isocyanate to give the corresponding cycloadducts by releasing the Lewis base, indicating the formation of a single&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide intermediate.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Decarboxylation of Proline&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Protein&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved protocol for the C&#8208;terminal decarboxylation of peptidic compounds opens an efficient access to new amino acid&#8208;derived building blocks with potentially improved drug&#8208;like properties. The method was applied in the late&#8208;stage decarboxylation of a polycyclic diproline mimetic and in the synthesis of a first decarboxy&#8208;inhibitor of the EVH1domain.







Abstract
Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline&#8208;derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology&#8197;1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug&#8208;like properties and cell permeability need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late&#8208;stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late&#8208;stage decarboxylation of ProM&#8208;like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline&#8208;derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy&#8208;ProM&#8208;1 into the pentapeptide&#8208;like compound Ac[2ClF][ProM&#8208;2][Decarb&#8208;ProM&#8208;1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][ProM1]OMe). However, despite better calculated drug&#8208;like properties, this compound did not inhibit chemotaxis in a cellular assay.

         <title>Luminescent Tetranuclear Copper(I) and Gold(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes: A Phosphine Acetylide Amidinate Orthogonal Ligand Framework for Selective Complexation</title>

Luminescent tetranuclear heterobimetallic complexes: Heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes with phosphine acetylide amidinate ligand were synthesized by using different reaction pathways. These complexes are found to be luminescent and differ in terms of ancillary ligands at AuI centre.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)3] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2]. {Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] features a Cu2 unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, C6F5). In these reactions, the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to the rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.

         <title>Prebiotic Formation of Peptides Through Bubbling and Arc Plasma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>

Peptides formation from amino acids in a simulation of lightning scene occurring on the sea surface of the early Earth. We constructed this scenario in lab by simply combining bubble and arc plasma without any additional reagents and its effectiveness of prebiotic synthesis from a wide range of 20 amino acids was validated.







Abstract
The abiotic synthesis of peptides, widely regarded as one of the key chemical reactions on the prebiotic Earth, is thermodynamically constrained in solution. Herein, a simulation of the lightning phenomenon on the sea surface using bubble bursting and arc plasma under ambient conditions enables dipeptide formation of six amino acids with conversion ratios ranging from 2.6&#8201;% to 25.5&#8201;%. Additionally, we observed the formation of biologically active tripeptides and investigated the stereoselectivity of the dipeptide formation reaction. By utilizing a mixture of 20 amino acids in the reaction, 102 possible dipeptides were generated. These results establish experimental constructions to mimic achievable prebiotic conditions and provide a credible pathway for endogenous biopolymer synthesis on prebiotic Earth.

         <title>m6A Methylation of Transcription Leader Sequence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Impacts Discontinuous Transcription of Subgenomic mRNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>

Host&#8208;mediated regulation: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA at position A74 is methylated to m6A by the host METTL3/METTL14 complex. We show that this modification destabilizes the structure of stemloop 3 in the 5&#8217; untranslated region. This modification of a transcription regulatory sequence has a significant effect on the stability of the duplexes that are formed during viral RNA synthesis, and regulate abundance of the subgenomic RNAs.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome has been shown to be m6A methylated at several positions in&#8197;vivo. Strikingly, a DRACH motif, the recognition motif for adenosine methylation, resides in the core of the transcriptional regulatory leader sequence (TRS&#8722;L) at position A74, which is highly conserved and essential for viral discontinuous transcription. Methylation at position A74 correlates with viral pathogenicity. Discontinuous transcription produces a set of subgenomic mRNAs that function as templates for translation of all structural and accessory proteins. A74 is base&#8208;paired in the short stem&#8208;loop structure 5&#8217;SL3 that opens during discontinuous transcription to form long&#8208;range RNA&#8208;RNA interactions with nascent (&#8722;)&#8208;strand transcripts at complementary TRS&#8208;body sequences. A74 can be methylated by the human METTL3/METTL14 complex in&#8197;vitro. Here, we investigate its impact on the structural stability of 5&#8217;SL3 and the long&#8208;range TRS&#8208;leader:TRS&#8208;body duplex formation necessary for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs of all four viral structural proteins. Methylation uniformly destabilizes 5&#8217;SL3 and long&#8208;range duplexes and alters their relative equilibrium populations, suggesting that the m6A74 modification acts as a regulator for the abundance of viral structural proteins due to this destabilization.

Tubulysin analogs can now be functionalized with the p&#8208;aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium linker and a cleavable peptide on solid phase, with a higher efficiency and better safety than in previous solution&#8208;phase protocols. This all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy also allows the diversification at the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, producing first&#8208;in&#8208;class analogs functionalized with lipids, linkers, and conjugation handles.Improved access to potent anticancer tubulysins and linker&#8208;functionalized payloads via an all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy (Daniel G.

Abstract
Tubulysins are among the most recent antimitotic compounds to enter into antibody/peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC/PDC) development. Thus far, the design of the most promising tubulysin payloads relied on simplifying their structures, e.&#8201;g., by using small tertiary amide N&#8208;substituents (Me, Et, Pr) on the tubuvaline residue. Cumbersome solution&#8208;phase approaches are typically used for both syntheses and functionalization with cleavable linkers. p&#8208;Aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium (PABQ) linkers were a remarkable advancement for targeted delivery, but the procedures to incorporate them into tubulysins are only of moderate efficiency. Here we describe a novel all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy permitting a loss&#8208;free resin linkage and an improved access to super potent tubulysin analogs showing close resemblance to the natural compounds. For the first time, a protocol enables the integration of on&#8208;resin tubulysin derivatization with, e.&#8201;g., a maleimido&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PABQ linker, which is a notable progress for the payload&#8208;PABQ&#8208;linker technology. The strategy also allows tubulysin diversification of the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, thus enabling to screen a tubulysin library for the discovery of new potent analogs. This work provides ADC/PDC developers with new tools for both rapid access to new derivatives and easier linker&#8208;attachment and functionalization.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation of Formate for Hydrocarboxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose a heterogeneous photocatalytic strategy of C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes over zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4) under visible light. Mechanistic investigations indicate that C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate is induced by S&#8901; species on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) instead of a photogenerated hole oxidation mechanism.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven carboxylation offers a promising approach for synthesizing valuable fine chemicals under mild conditions. Here we disclose a heterogeneous photocatalytic strategy of C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes over zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4) under visible light. This protocol functions well with a variety of substituted styrenes with good to excellent yields; it also works for unactivated alkenes albeit with lower yields. Mechanistic studies confirm the existence of CO2&#8901;&#8722; as a key intermediate. It was found that C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate is induced by S&#8901; species on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) instead of a photogenerated hole oxidation mechanism. Moreover, both cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;H of HCOO&#8722; and formation of a benzylic anion were found to be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step for the hydrocarboxylation of styrene.

         <title>Front Cover: Selective Transition Enhancement in a g&#8208;Engineered Diradical (Chem. Eur. J. 42/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diradical was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#8901; radical system. The molecule was shown to exhibit a weak exchange interaction between its two radical units. The g&#8208;asymmetry combined with the magnetic interaction led to the electron paramagnetic resonance transition of different tipping angles, which could be selectively enhanced by proper choice of applied magnetic field and microwave power. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Boudalis, A. Mizuno, M. Ruben and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400420).

         <title>Cover Feature: Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State (Chem. Eur. J. 42/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrene is a well&#8208;known excellent organic luminescent molecule, but it suffers from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;induced aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in the solid state. In our study, the encapsulation of a crown ether can significantly enhance the fluorescence of the pyrene in the solid state, resulting in a transformation from ACQ to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Moreover, we also found that the original impure emission of the pyrene could be purified to a single emission. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Li and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400741).

The Cover Feature shows the formation of structurally complex &#948;,&#948;&#8208;dimethoxy allyl sulfone derivatives, highlighting the direct nucleophilic attack of methoxide on sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes. The magical box metaphorically serves as the focal point, from which a large treasure of diverse and structurally intricate allylic sulfone derivatives bursts forth. The vibrant hue in the background emanating from the box symbolises the energy and excitement of newly synthesized compounds. The use of blue crystals interspersed among the compounds adds an element of elegance and refinement, suggesting the high value of these allylic sulfone derivatives. Surrounding the main stream of light are various allylic sulfone derivatives, adorned with different functional groups, indicating the versatility and potential for customization in their synthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Kumar and B.&#8197;A. Shah (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401049).

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Multi&#8208;Chromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of multi&#8208;chromophoric systems can provide highly ordered materials with distinct optoelectronic properties. Self&#8208;assembled materials through crystal, liquid crystal and supramolecular polymer formation of various multi&#8208;chromophoric systems have been reported. In this review, we focus on different molecular design strategies adopted till date to fabricate self&#8208;assembled materials with distinct optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of chromophoric systems is a prerequisite to create well&#8208;ordered, processable nanomaterials with multiple functionalities. In the past two decades, the field of functional organic materials has primarily focused on systems featuring only one type of dye/&#960;&#8208;conjugated unit. Consequently, many reports with mechanistic insights on the self&#8208;assembly of the dyes featuring different molecular packing have been reported. Subsequently, we have witnessed several attempts to organize the multi&#8208;chromophoric systems in solution and solid&#8208;state via different approaches using self&#8208;assembly as a tool. Incorporation of more than one dye is important in creating materials with tuneable optoelectronic properties. Consequently, self&#8208;assembly of more than one chromophoric systems have been investigated to some extent. This review aims to discuss the self&#8208;assembled materials derived from discrete &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems comprising more than one dye units connected through covalent bonding (multi&#8208;chromophoric systems). Molecular design of various multi&#8208;chromophoric systems leading to the formation of crystals, liquid crystals and supramolecular polymers have been correlated with corresponding properties. We envisage that classification of self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;chromophoric systems, with a note on tuneable optoelectronic properties, can provide a deeper understanding on the molecular design strategies, which is important in the fabrication of functional organic materials with optimum performances.

         <title>O/S Exchange Reaction in Synthesizing Sulfur&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 42, July 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copolymerization of epoxides with carbon disulfide (CS2) or carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a facile and versatile method to produce sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with distinctive properties and functions. Of special, the copolymerization invariably exhibits the intensely complicated chemistry of O/S exchange reaction, leading to the functional sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with diverse architectures.







Abstract
Using carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) as sulfur&#8208;containing and one&#8208;carbon feedstocks to make value&#8208;added products is paramount for both pure and applied chemistry and environmental science. One of the practical strategies is to copolymerize these bulk chemicals with epoxides to produce sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. This approach contributes to improving the sustainability of polymer manufacturing, provides highly desired functional polymer materials, and has attracted much attention. However, these copolymerizations invariably exhibit the intensely complicated chemistry of O/S exchange reaction, leading to sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with diverse architectures. As the understanding of O/S exchange continues to deepen, recent efforts have guided significant advances in the synthesis of CS2&#8208; and COS&#8208;based polymers. This review examines the O/S exchange chemistry and summarizes the recent progress in this field to promote the further advance of synthesizing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers from CS2 and COS.

         <title>Intramolecularly O,N,O&#8208;Coordinated Tin(II) Salts: Syntheses, Structures, Cyclization, and Transition Metal Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine derivatives Ln containing phosphonyl, phosphinyl, carbonic ester, and carbonic amide type substituents in 2,6&#8208;positions induce autoionization of tin(II) halides giving pairs of intramolecularly O,N,O&#8208;coordinated [LnSnX]+ cations and SnX3&#8722; anions. These undergo thermally induced ester cleavage giving Sn(II) heterocycles containing stereogenic centres, and proved suitable as ligands toward W(CO)4.







Abstract
We report the syntheses of tin(II) salts of the types [L1SnX]SnX3 [L1=2,6&#8208;{(i&#8208;PrO)2(O)P}2C5H3N: 1, X=Cl; 2, X=Br], [L2SnCl]SnCl3 [L2=2&#8208;{(i&#8208;PrO)Ph(O)P}&#8208;6&#8208;{(i&#8208;PrO)2(O)P}C5H3N: 3], [L3SnX]SnX3 [L3=2,6&#8208;{MeO(O)C}2C5H3N: 4, X=Cl; 5, X=Br], [L4SnX]SnX3 [L4=2,6&#8208;{Et2N(O)C}2C5H3N: 6, X=Cl; 7, X=Br]. These compounds were obtained by addition of SnX2 to the corresponding ligand inducing autoionization of the respective tin(II) halide. The thermal stability of 1, 3, and 4 was elucidated, giving, under ester cleavage and cyclisation, the tin(II) derivatives 8&#8211;12. The reaction of [L1SnCl]SnCl3 (1) with W(CO)4(thf)2 afforded the tungsten tetracarbonyl complex [{L1SnCl}{SnCl3}W(CO)4] (13), representing the first example in which a tin(II) stannate anion and a tin(II) stannylium cation simultaneously coordinate to a transition metal centre. The compounds were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and in part by elemental analyses, IR and NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. DFT calculations accompany the experimental work.

         <title>Molecular Packing Topology and Interactions to Decipher Mechanical Compliances in Dicyano&#8208;Distyrylbenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems, including polymorphs, solvate crystal, and isometric charge transfer crystals of dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene derivatives with similar molecular structures but varying structural and interaction characteristics were investigated in detail to explore the key molecular arrangements necessary for mechanical compliance. The results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending observed in semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystals.







Abstract
Flexible optoelectronics is the need of the hour as the market moves toward wearable and conformable devices. Crystalline &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials offer high performance as active materials compared to their amorphous counterpart, but they are typically brittle. This poses a significant challenge that needs to be overcome to unfold their potential in optoelectronic devices. Unveiling the molecular packing topology and identifying interaction descriptors that can accommodate strain offers essential guiding principles for developing conjugated materials as active components in flexible optoelectronics. The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems of dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene derivatives are investigated. Face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacks in an inclined orientation relative to the bending surface can accommodate expansion and compression with minimal molecular motion from their equilibrium positions. This configuration exhibits good compliance towards mechanical strain, while a similar structure with a criss&#8208;cross arrangement capable of distributing applied strain equally in opposite directions enhances the flexibility. Molecular arrangements that cannot reversibly undergo expansion and compression exhibit brittleness. In the isometric CT crystals, the disproportionate strength of the interactions along the bending plane and orthogonal directions makes these materials sustain a moderate bending strain. These results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending in semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystals.

The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems of dicyano-distyrylbenzene derivatives are investigated. Face-to-face &#960;-stacks in an inclined orientation relative to the bending surface can accommodate expansion and compression with minimal molecular motion from their equilibrium positions. This configuration exhibits good compliance towards mechanical strain, while a similar structure with a criss-cross arrangement capable of distributing applied strain equally in opposite directions enhances the flexibility. Molecular arrangements that cannot reversibly undergo expansion and compression exhibit brittleness. In the isometric CT crystals, the disproportionate strength of the interactions along the bending plane and orthogonal directions makes these materials sustain a moderate bending strain. These results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending in semiconducting &#960;-conjugated crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic and Molecular Structures of a Series of Nickel Bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dithiolates</title>

A series of Ni bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;dithiolate complexes provide the basis for a spectroscopic and computational study that tracks the substituent electronic effects with the observed properties through 13C NMR chemical shifts and electronic spectra. The underlying redox innocence of the ligand is established and contrasted with its dithiolene isomers.







Abstract
A series of homoleptic Ni bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;dithiolates, [Ni(S2C2RR&#8242;)2]2&#8722; (R=CN, R&#8242;=CN, CO2Et, CONH2, Ph, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;Cl, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;OMe, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;NO2, Ph&#8208;3&#8208;CF3, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;CF3, Ph&#8208;4&#8208;CN; R=NO2, R&#8242;=H; R=R&#8242;=CO2Et) have been synthesized from the reaction of the alkali metal salt of the ligand and nickel chloride, and isolated as tetraphenylphosphonium or tetrabutylammonium salts. The complexes were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electronic absorption spectroscopies. The molecular structures show a rigidly square planar Ni(II) center linking two four&#8208;membered chelate rings whose dimensions are constant across the series. The electronic effect of the ligand substituent is revealed in the 13C NMR and electronic spectra, and corroborated by density functional calculations. Electron withdrawing groups deshield the low&#8208;field CS2 resonance, and the signature charge transfer band in the visible region is red&#8208;shifted. These observables have been accurately reproduced computationally, and revealed the Ni contribution to the ground state diminishes with decreasing electron withdrawing capacity of the ligand substituent. In contrast to 1,2&#8208;dithiolates, the redox inactivity afforded by 1,1&#8208;dithiolates stems from the smaller chelate ring and substantially reduced sulfur content that is key to stabilizing the radical form.

         <title>Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Photoswitches with Enhanced Solar Spectrum Match</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Norbornadiene absorbs in the UV region making it unsuitable for molecular solar thermal energy storage. A new series of visible light&#8208;absorbing norbornadienes were synthesized and evaluated. The strategy displayed a pronounced solar spectrum match pushing absorption onset to 595&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Herein, we report monomeric and dimeric norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane molecular photoswitch systems intended for molecular solar thermal applications. A series of six new norbornadiene derivatives conjugated with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and dithiafulvene as the donor unit were synthesized and fully characterized. The photoswitches were evaluated by experimentally and theoretically measuring optical absorption profiles and thermal conversion of quadricyclane to norbornadiene. Computational insight by density functional theory calculations at the M06&#8208;2X/def2&#8208;SVPD level of theory provided geometries, storage energies, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, and HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels that are used to describe the function of the molecular systems. The studied molecules exhibit absorption onset ranging from 416&#8197;nm to 595&#8197;nm due to a systemic change in their donor&#8208;acceptor character. This approach was advantageous due to the introduction of benzothiadiazole and the dimeric nature of molecular structures. The best&#8208;performing system has a half&#8208;life of 3&#8197;days with quantum yields over 50&#8201;%.

         <title>Stacking Structure of Vaterite Revealed by Atomic Imaging and Diffraction Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After a century of discussion, the atomic arrangements of vaterite are fully visualized and described as a layer structure consisting of calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets. The layers are stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer under two constraints: (i) carbonate ions cannot occupy equivalent positions in alternate layers, and (ii) the stacking sequences with orthogonal components are dominated.







Abstract
Anhydrous calcium carbonate crystals exist as three polymorphs: calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. Although vaterite is a metastable phase rarely found in the geological environment, it is intriguing that various biominerals are composed of vaterite. The processes of stable vaterite formation in biological systems cannot be understood without elucidating the nature of vaterite. The crystal structure of vaterite has been discussed for nearly a century but is still an open question. Here we propose the actual structure of vaterite by combining atomic imaging and diffraction analysis with simulations of disordered stacking sequences. Vaterite basically appears as layers of hexagonal calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer. However, equivalent carbonate positions in alternating layers are forbidden, and four&#8208;layer stacking in which the fourth layer rotates 180&#176; relative to the first layer are predominant, forming an orthogonal reciprocal lattice in diffraction patterns. These stacking characteristics replicate the intensity distribution in the electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This study has almost completely elucidated the crystal structure and stacking sequence of vaterite. Our findings provide insights into the thermodynamic stability of vaterite, which facilitates comprehension of the biomineralization processes and growth dynamics of calcium carbonate.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Construction of Stereochemical Arrays Exploiting Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bonding in Enolborates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arrays bearing contiguous stereocenters are generated by a copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol reaction. Cyclic, acyclic, fused and spirocyclic aldols were prepared with excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and in some cases, enantioselectivities. DFT calculations reveal that the transition state for the enolborate aldol is stabilized by non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol addition to aldehydes and ketones, with pinacolborane as stoichiometric reductant, that results in the generation of stereodefined syn&#8208;aldol products. Cyclic, acyclic, fused and spirocyclic aldols bearing contiguous stereocenters are obtained with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. Moreover, enantioselective reactions could be carried out with cycloalkenones to deliver aldols bearing three contiguous stereocenters and with up to 98&#8201;% ee.

     alt="Diastereo- and Enantioselective Construction of Stereochemical Arrays Exploiting Non-Classical Hydrogen Bonding in Enolborates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrays bearing contiguous stereocenters are generated by a copper-catalyzed reductive aldol reaction. Cyclic, acyclic, fused and spirocyclic aldols were prepared with excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and in some cases, enantioselectivities. DFT calculations reveal that the transition state for the enolborate aldol is stabilized by non-classical hydrogen bonding interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a copper-catalyzed reductive aldol addition to aldehydes and ketones, with pinacolborane as stoichiometric reductant, that results in the generation of stereodefined &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-aldol products. Cyclic, acyclic, fused and spirocyclic aldols bearing contiguous stereocenters are obtained with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. Moreover, enantioselective reactions could be carried out with cycloalkenones to deliver aldols bearing three contiguous stereocenters and with up to 98&#8201;% ee. Computations reveal that the enolborate intermediate undergoes the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-aldol reaction via a twist-boat transition state that is stabilized by non-classical hydrogen bonding interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phosphanyl Phosphagermene and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphanyl phosphagermene described. Two principal reactivity modes were observed for this novel compound. On the one hand, it reacts as a geminal frustrated Lewis pair towards CO2 and nitriles. By contrast, with amines and metal complexes, the P=Ge double bond reacts in 1,2&#8208;addition reactions.







Abstract
Reaction of a nucleophilic germylene Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 with the phosphanyl phosphaketene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]PCO induces decarbonylation to form a phosphanyl phosphagermene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]P=Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 (1; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;phenyl). Addition of CO2 or MeCN to 1 results in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions to afford five&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mode of reactivity is reminiscent of that observed for frustrated Lewis pairs, with the pendant phosphanyl group acting as a base and the germanium center as a Lewis acid. Contrastingly, 1,2&#8208;addition across the P=Ge bond was observed when using ammonia, small primary amines (NH2nP), or metal complexes (e.&#8201;g. Au(PPh3)Cl and ZnEt2). These latter reactions allow for the one&#8208;step synthesis of metal phosphide complexes.

         <title>Masking the Bioactivity of Hydroxamic Acids by Coordination to Cobalt: Towards Bioreductive Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordinating the anticancer drug vorinostat to a Co(III) center, the antiproliferative activity of the bioactive molecule is diminished by two orders of magnitude. The low bioactivity could be related to the marginal uptake of the Co&#8208;vorinostat complexes into cancer cells.







Abstract
The clinical use of many potent anticancer agents is limited by their non&#8208;selective toxicity to healthy tissue. One of these examples is vorinostat (SAHA), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, which shows high cytotoxicity with limited discrimination for cancerous over healthy cells. In an attempt to improve tumor selectivity, we exploited the properties of cobalt(III) as a redox&#8208;active metal center through stabilization with cyclen and cyclam tetraazamacrocycles, masking the anticancer activity of SAHA and other hydroxamic acid derivatives to allow for the complex to reach the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. Biological assays demonstrated the desired low in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity of the complexes, suggesting effective masking of the activity of SAHA. Once in the tumor, the bioactive moiety may be released through the reduction of the CoIII center. Investigations revealed long&#8208;term stability of the complexes, with cyclic voltammetry and chemical reduction experiments supporting the design hypothesis of SAHA release through the reduction of the CoIII prodrug. The results highlight the potential for further developing this complex class as novel anticancer agents by masking the high cytotoxicity of a given drug, however, the cellular uptake needs to be improved.

         <title>Ligand Conformation Controls Assembly of a Helicate/Mesocate, Heteroleptic [Pd2L2L&#8242;2] Cages and a Six&#8208;Jagged [Pd6L12] Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acridone&#8208;based ligand with rotatable isoquinoline donor arms shows high versatility to create multiple types of assemblies. From a homoleptic mesocate and helicate to heteroleptic cages, it can also lead to the formation of an unprecedented six&#8208;jagged Pd6L12 ring in the solid state.







Abstract
Molecular building blocks, capable of adopting several strongly deviating conformations, are of particular interest in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemblies. The pronounced structural flexibility of a short acridone&#8208;based bridging ligand, equipped with two monodentate isoquinoline donors, is herein exploited to assemble a surprisingly diverse series of coordination&#8208;driven Pd(II) architectures. First, it can form a highly twisted Pd2L4 helicate, transformable into the corresponding mesocate, controlled by temperature, counter anion and choice of solvent. Second, it also allows the formation of heteroleptic cages, either from a mix of ligands with Pd(II) cations or by cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation from homoleptic assemblies. Here, the acridone&#8208;based ligand tolerates counter ligands that carry their donors either in a diverging or converging arrangement, as it can rotate its own coordination sites by 90&#176; and structurally adapt to both situations via shape complementarity. Third, by a near 180&#176; rotation of only one of its arms, the ligand can adopt an S&#8208;shape conformation and form an unprecedented C6h&#8208;symmetric Pd6L12 saw&#8208;toothed six&#8208;membered ring.

         <title>A Data&#8208;driven Approach&#160;for Enhanced CO2 Capture&#160;with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and use CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8208;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8211;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8211;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel Ru complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties with Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every biological and physicochemical process occurring in a fluid phase depends on the diffusion coefficient (D) of the species in solution. In the present work, a model to describe and fit the behaviour of D as a function of structure and extensive thermodynamics parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules is developed. Supporting experimental and computational evidences for this model are obtained by measuring D for a series of n&#8208;alcohols through a novel surface plasmon resonance method and molecular dynamics simulations. This allows to propose a kind of combined analysis to explain the dependence of D on various thermodynamic and structural parameters. The results suggest that for small linear systems in the range from 0 to 200 g mol&#8208;1 and under the assumption that the diffusive activation energy is a linear function of mass, D is strictly dependent on the molecular shape and on the relative strength of the solute&#8208;solvent intermolecular forces represented by a parameter named R. The newly proposed approach can be utilized to characterize and monitor progressive changes in physicochemical properties for any investigated species upon increasing the dimension of the aggregate/molecule along a certain direction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Chalcogen Bonding Recognition Arrays in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;substituted pyridino&#8208;based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and in the solid state through a dual donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 15&#8208;50 M&#8211;1 range. Computational studies on the dimers depict a notable charge&#8208;transfer contribution to the association, validating Pyrselen as an effective scaffold for designing chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based recognition motifs.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: : In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Insight into Complexation Between Cyclocarbons and C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work conducts the comprehensive theoretical study on the non&#8208;covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano&#8208;Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2:1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. In C60@2C34 trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1:2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>A Review of Electrospun Carbon&#8208;based Nanofibers Materials Used in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical values (200&#8208;250 Wh kg&#8208;1), which cannot meet the fast&#8208;growing energy storage  demands. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the next&#8208;generation energy storage system owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g&#8208;1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg&#8208;1). Nonetheless, Li&#8208;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8208;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and issues faced by carbon&#8208;based nanofibers composites in the application of Li&#8208;S batteries are summarized, and the future development trajectory are outlined.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite the existence of three competing reactions for propargyloxyoxindoles, we report a chemoselectivity switch between enantioselective propargyl [2,3]&#8208;Wittig rearrangement and Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type reactions, with suppression of the [1,2]&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type rearrangement. Using C1&#8208;symmetric imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand and Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid, diverse 3&#8208;hydroxy 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles containing allenyl groups were obtained in up to 98% yield and 99% ee via asymmetric propargyl [2,3]&#8208;Wittig rearrangement. In the presence of AgOTf&#8208;Duanphos, chiral spiro dihydrofuran oxindoles were given in up to 98% yield and 91% ee through a Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of BCL&#8208;2 Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BCL&#8208;2 is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers. Herein, we report our efforts to develop a BCL&#8208;2 degrader by incorporating either venetoclax or Nap&#8208;1 derivative into chimeric compounds hijacking CRBN, VHL or IAP as the E3 ligase.







Abstract
BCL&#8208;2, a member of the BCL&#8208;2 protein family, is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Due to its aberrant activity, it is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers and represents an attractive target for the development of therapeutics that antagonize its activity. A selective BCL&#8208;2 inhibitor, venetoclax, was approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and other haematologic malignancies, validating BCL&#8208;2 as an anticancer target. Since then, alternative therapeutic approaches to modulate the activity of BCL&#8208;2 have been explored, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras. Despite numerous research groups focusing on developing degraders of BCL&#8208;2 family member proteins, selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTACs remain elusive, as disclosed compounds only show dual BCL&#8208;xL/BCL&#8208;2 degradation. Herein, we report our efforts to develop BCL&#8208;2 degraders by incorporating two BCL&#8208;2 binding moieties into chimeric compounds that aim to hijack one of three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and IAPs. Even though our project did not result in obtaining a potent and selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTAC, our research will aid in understanding the narrow chemical space of BCL&#8208;2 degraders.

         <title>Advancing Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol chemistry for one&#8208;pot bioconjugation is reported, highlighting its versatility and efficiency. This method enables dual, sequential, and orthogonal bioconjugation, facilitating multiple modifications in a single reaction. The approach simplifies complex biochemical processes, providing a streamlined and effective solution for advanced bioconjugation applications in research and development.







Abstract
Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1&#8197;h) and high yield (&gt;90&#8201;%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates. Furthermore, the results highlight its potential for versatile applications across fundamental and translational biomedical research.

         <title>Tuning the Flavin Core via Donor Appendage for Selective Subcellular Bioimaging and PDT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel design around flavin core skeleton incorporating a methoxy&#8208;naphthyl appendage is reported. The novel flavin entity was found to be highly emissive probe for selective lysosome bioimaging application. Furthermore, photosensitization capability of the mNF was evaluated for photodynamic therapy application against the B16 skin cancer cells.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel flavin analogue as singular chemical component for lysosome bioimaging, and inherited photosensitizer capability of the flavin core was demonstrated as a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Fine&#8208;tuning the flavin core with the incorporation of methoxy naphthyl appendage provides an appropriate chemical design, thereby offering photostability, selectivity, and lysosomal colocalization, along with the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature, making it suitable for lysosomal bioimaging applications. Additionally, photosensitization capability of the flavin core with photostable nature of the synthesized analogue has shown remarkable capacity for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, making it a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Sialyllactose&#8208;Imprinted Nanogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different monomers were explored for the synthesis of imprinted nanogels targeting &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. A bottom&#8208;up platform including NMR spectroscopy, ARS titration, in silico studies and Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis provides a ranking and leads to the best material in terms of affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
We describe a facile method to prepare water&#8208;compatible molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP NGs) as synthetic antibodies against target glycans. Three different phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives were explored as monomers for the synthesis of MIP NGs targeting either &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. Starting from commercially available 3&#8208;acrylamidophenylboronic acid, also its 2&#8208;substituted isomer and the 5&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxymethyl cyclic PBA monoester derivative were initially evaluated by NMR studies. Then, a small library of MIP NGs imprinted with the &#945;2,6&#8208;linked template was synthesized and tested by mobility shift Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (msACE), to rapidly assess an affinity ranking. Finally, the best monomer 2&#8208;acrylamido PBA was selected for the synthesis of polymers targeting both sialyllactoses. The resulting MIP NGs display an affinity constant&#8776;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and selectivity towards imprinted glycans. This general procedure could be applied to any non&#8208;modified carbohydrate template possessing a reducing end.

         <title>Photoinduced Energy and Electron Transfer in a &#8216;Two&#8208;Point&#8217; Bound Panchromatic, Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY(Zinc Porphyrin)2 &#8211; Fullerene Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination approach has been developed to construct a multimodular donor&#8208;acceptor conjugate featuring &#960;&#8208;connected bis zinc porphyrin&#8208;bisstrylBODIPY and bipyridine functionalized fulleropyrrolidine. Upon full characterization of this conjugate by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical and time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, occurrence of ultrafast energy transfer from excited zinc porphyrin to bisstrylBODIPY and electron transfer involving C60 in the conjugate is demonstrated using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe technique.







Abstract
Structurally well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled supramolecular multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates play a significant role in furthering our understanding of photoinduced energy and electron transfer events occurring in nature, e.&#8201;g., in the antenna&#8208;reaction centers of photosynthesis and their applications in light energy harvesting. However, building such multi&#8208;modular systems capable of mimicking the early events of photosynthesis has been synthetically challenging, causing a major hurdle for its growth. Often, multi&#8208;modularity is brought in by combining both covalent and noncovalent approaches. In the present study, we have developed such an approach wherein a &#960;&#8208;extended conjugated molecular cleft, two zinc(II)porphyrin bearing bisstyrylBODIPY (dyad, 1), has been synthesized. The binding of 1 via a &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination of a bis&#8208;pyridyl fulleropyrrolidine (2), forming a stable self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex (1&#8201;:&#8201;2), has been established. The self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been fully characterized by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical methods, including TD&#8208;DFT studies. From the established energy diagram, both energy and electron transfer events were envisioned. In dyad 1, selective excitation of zinc(II)porphyrin leads to efficient singlet&#8208;singlet excitation transfer to (bisstyrly)BODIPY with an energy transfer rate constant, kEnT of 2.56&#215;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1. In complex 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, photoexcitation of zinc(II)porphyrin results in ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer with a charge separation rate constant, kCS of 2.83&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a charge recombination rate constant, kCR of 2.51&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1. For excitation at 730&#8197;nm corresponding to bisstyrylBODIPY, similar results are obtained, where a biexponential decay yielded estimated values of kCS 3.44&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 2.97&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a kCR value of 2.10&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1. The newly built self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been shown to successfully mimic the early events of the photosynthetic antenna&#8208;reaction center events.

     alt="Photoinduced Energy and Electron Transfer in a &#8216;Two-Point&#8217; Bound Panchromatic, Near-Infrared-Absorbing Bis-styrylBODIPY(Zinc Porphyrin)2 &#8211; Fullerene Self-Assembled Supramolecular Conjugate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8216;two-point&#8217; metal-ligand coordination approach has been developed to construct a multimodular donor-acceptor conjugate featuring &#960;-connected bis zinc porphyrin-bisstrylBODIPY and bipyridine functionalized fulleropyrrolidine. Upon full characterization of this conjugate by a suite of physico-chemical and time-dependent DFT studies, occurrence of ultrafast energy transfer from excited zinc porphyrin to bisstrylBODIPY and electron transfer involving C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; in the conjugate is demonstrated using femtosecond pump-probe technique.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally well-defined self-assembled supramolecular multi-modular donor-acceptor conjugates play a significant role in furthering our understanding of photoinduced energy and electron transfer events occurring in nature, e.&#8201;g., in the antenna-reaction centers of photosynthesis and their applications in light energy harvesting. However, building such multi-modular systems capable of mimicking the early events of photosynthesis has been synthetically challenging, causing a major hurdle for its growth. Often, multi-modularity is brought in by combining both covalent and noncovalent approaches. In the present study, we have developed such an approach wherein a &#960;-extended conjugated &lt;i&gt;molecular cleft&lt;/i&gt;, two zinc(II)porphyrin bearing bisstyrylBODIPY (dyad, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), has been synthesized. The binding of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; via a &#8216;two-point&#8217; metal-ligand coordination of a &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-pyridyl fulleropyrrolidine (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), forming a stable self-assembled supramolecular complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), has been established. The self-assembled supramolecular complex has been fully characterized by a suite of physico-chemical methods, including TD-DFT studies. From the established energy diagram, both energy and electron transfer events were envisioned. In dyad &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, selective excitation of zinc(II)porphyrin leads to efficient singlet-singlet excitation transfer to (bisstyrly)BODIPY with an energy transfer rate constant, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EnT&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.56&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, photoexcitation of zinc(II)porphyrin results in ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer with a charge separation rate constant, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CS&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.83&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1,&lt;/sup&gt; and a charge recombination rate constant, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CR&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.51&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For excitation at 730&#8197;nm corresponding to bisstyrylBODIPY, similar results are obtained, where a biexponential decay yielded estimated values of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;CR&lt;/sub&gt; value of 2.10&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Ultrapotent Tricyclic Ligands for FK506&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rigid, sp3&#8208;rich tricyclic scaffold has been designed as a module for the development of FKBP small molecule ligands and molecular glues. Structure&#8208;based design enabled the synthesized scaffold to precisely lock all functional groups for the optimal interaction with the protein target. Upon structural optimization, a dramatic improvement in cellular activity is observed for the substituted tricyclic FKBP ligands.







Abstract
Access to small, rigid, and sp3&#8208;rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506&#8208;binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate&#8208;mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely positions functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14&#8208;step gram&#8208;scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and N&#8208;acyl iminium cyclization. Structure&#8208;based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.

         <title>Bridging Dehydrogenation and Hydrogenation in Heterogeneous Catalysis: A Demonstration of a Unified Catalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research showcases the dual dehydrogenation and hydrogenation capabilities of an innovative hybrid catalyst, illustrated through the cyclooctane&#8722;cyclooctene model. This hybrid catalyst combines a pincer iridium complex with Pd&#8722;Ru heterostructures, both supported on solid &#947;&#8208;alumina, serving as a compelling proof of concept for tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation processes.







Abstract
In the pursuit of enhancing the applications of hydrogen as an energy carrier, this research delved into the utilization of a singular hybrid catalyst capable of performing both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes for Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs). This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid catalyst, combining an organometallic pincer complex with Pd&#8722;Ru heterostructures supported on &#947;&#8208;alumina. Unlike conventional transition and noble metal nanoparticles, the use of a pincer complex offers exceptional thermal stability due to its aryl backbone, which is advantageous for various endothermic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons in LOHCs. This pioneering hybrid catalyst is a novel approach, demonstrating a proof of concept. In this study, we utilized the hybrid catalyst to investigate the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of a lower enthalpic system, specifically the cyclooctane&#8722;cyclooctene system. The dehydrogenation of cyclooctane was conducted at 443&#8197;K using tertiary butyl ethylene as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, while the hydrogenation of cyclooctene reaction catalyzed by Pd&#8722;Ru nanostructures occurred at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm H2. The results showed successful tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges were noted in terms of catalytic activity and recyclability, providing valuable insights for further refinement and optimization.

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations of (Anti)Aromaticity in Oxidized and Reduced Porphyrin and Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroelectrochemical studies of porphyrin and norcorrole reveal how the vis&#8208;NIR spectra report (anti)aromaticity, which switches upon oxidation and reduction. In contrast, the IR spectra are less informative.







Abstract
Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18&#960; neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16&#960; neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16&#960; porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18&#960; dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with H&#252;ckel's rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectra.

         <title>Thermally Stable P&#8208;Chiral Supramolecular Phosphines, their Self&#8208;Assembly and Implication in Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines with enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;% is reported. These phosphines are stable up to 150&#8201;&#176;C and can be handled in air for a few hours. They can self&#8208;assemble on metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh to produce chiral catalysts. The self&#8208;assembled Rh&#8208;complex catalyzes the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes to yield chiral compound with an ee of 99&#8201;% and near quantitative conversion.







Abstract
P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one&#8208;step synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd&#8208;2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd&#8208;2 catalyzed a direct P&#8722;C coupling of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;iodophenyl)urea (B1)/2&#8208;iodo /6&#8208;hydroxy pyridine (B2) and,produced corresponding ligands L1&#8211;L3. The P&#8722;C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phosphindol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24&#8197;hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self&#8208;assembled and produced L2&#8722;C1 (Pt), L2&#8722;C2(Pd), and L2&#8722;C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self&#8208;assembled P&#8208;chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2&#8722;C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2&#8722;C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.

&lt;p&gt;P-chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one-step synthesis of thermally stable P-chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)-QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd-2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd-2 catalyzed a direct P&#8722;C coupling of 2,3-dihydro-1-H-phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1-(3-iodophenyl)urea (B1)/2-iodo /6-hydroxy pyridine (B2) and,produced corresponding ligands L1&#8211;L3. The P&#8722;C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6-(2,3-dihydro-1H-phosphindol-1-yl)pyridine-2(1H)-one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24&#8197;hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self-assembled and produced L2&#8722;C1 (Pt), L2&#8722;C2(Pd), and L2&#8722;C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self-assembled P-chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2&#8722;C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of &amp;gt;99&#8201;%. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2&#8722;C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Valorization of Corn Straw for Production of Glucose by Two&#8208;Step Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis is applied for selective degradation of corn straw to glucose production. As high as 32.2&#8201;% yield of glucose is achieved without additional catalyst and the active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation on glucose units of cellulose is crucial.







Abstract
Depolymerization of the cellulose part in lignocellulose to glucose is a significant step for lignocellulose valorization. As one of the main by&#8208;products of agricultural biomass in crop&#8208;producing filed, valorization of corn straw has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis was applied for selective depolymerization of the cellulose component of corn straw to glucose production. Most part of the hemicellulose component could be removed through high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment in the presence of low concentration of acetic acid, and then as high as 32.2&#8201;% yield of glucose was achieved in water at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h without additional catalyst. The active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation of hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups on glucose units of cellulose was shown to be crucial for the efficient valorization of corn straw for glucose production.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by Confinement of Cobalt Porphyrins in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt porphyrin was confined in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) leading to highly selective oxygen reduction towards H2O2. Moreover, the confinement led to a high stability during the electrochemical production and buildup of H2O2 for at least 5&#8197;h. Overall, this work shows that the use of MOFs to confine molecular complexes as single&#8208;site catalysts is an effective tool to enhance the stability and selectivity for electrochemical conversions.







Abstract
Sustainable alternatives for the energy intensive synthesis of H2O2 are necessary. Molecular cobalt catalysts show potential but are typically restricted by undesired bimolecular pathways leading to the breakdown of both H2O2 and the catalyst. The confinement of cobalt porphyrins in the PCN&#8208;224 metal&#8208;organic framework leads to an enhanced selectivity towards H2O2 and stability of the catalyst. Consequently, oxygen can now be selectively reduced to hydrogen peroxide with a stable conversion for at least 5&#8197;h, illustrating the potential of catalysts confined in MOFs to increase the selectivity and stability of electrocatalytic conversions.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Functionalized O&#8208;BODIPY Probes for Cations &#8211; A Selective Fluorescent Probe for Ba2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the design and synthesis and a fluorescence study of water&#8208;soluble benzo&#8208;crown ether substituted O&#8208;BODIPY dyes towards their fluorometric recognition behavior of cations. The benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped O&#8208;BODIPY shows a high affinity to Ba2+ enhanced water solubility and appropriate selectivity for detection of Ba2+ in the presence of other cations (cf. TOC).







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and sensing characteristics of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted BODIPY fluorescent probes (O&#8208;BODIPYs) 3, 4 and 5 equipped with differently sized benzo&#8208;crown ethers (cf. Scheme&#8197;1, 3 (benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5), 4 (benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and 5 (benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown7)). O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 exhibited in comparison to their known F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a (cf. Scheme&#8197;1) an improved solubility in aqueous medium and higher fluorescence quantum yields. Fluorometric study in aqueous solutions of 3, 4 and 5 in the presence of different cations show cation induced fluorescence enhancements (FE). Compared to the benzo&#8208;crown ether substituted F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a, we found for the free O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 higher fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f) but lower cation induced FEs. We show that in aqueous medium the fluorescence quenching process (OFF switching), a photoinduced electron transfer, in O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 is less effective and consequently sensitive and selective ON switching of the fluorescence by cations, too. Albeit these observations the novel benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped fluorescent probe 5 exhibits a good fluorometric Ba2+ selectivity and Ba2+ sensitivity in conjunction to their aqueous solubility.

         <title>Helix&#8208;to&#8208;Disc Conversion of Thia[6]helicenes into Coronenes Facilitated by Sulfur Oxidation and Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes, with their unique helical structures, have long captured the interest of synthetic chemists, not only as end products, but also as versatile platforms for further chemical transformations. However, transforming [6]helicene into planar coronene typically requires harsh conditions and poses significant challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that replacing the terminal benzene ring of [6]helicene with a thiophene ring enables its photochemical transformation into coronene. Sulfur oxidation of the thiophene ring enables the corresponding thermal transformation, and the terminal tetrafluorination of the opposite benzene ring further accelerates this process, yielding 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The transformation begins with an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, whose activation energy is significantly lowered by these structural changes. Our findings underscore the utility of strategic modifications such as sulfur oxidation and fluorination in promoting this "helix&#8208;to&#8208;disc"&#160;conversion and opening new avenues for synthesizing functional polycyclic aromatics.</dc:description>

However, transforming [6]helicene into planar coronene typically requires harsh conditions and poses significant challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that replacing the terminal benzene ring of [6]helicene with a thiophene ring enables its photochemical transformation into coronene. Sulfur oxidation of the thiophene ring enables the corresponding thermal transformation, and the terminal tetrafluorination of the opposite benzene ring further accelerates this process, yielding 1,2-difluorocoronene, as confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The transformation begins with an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, whose activation energy is significantly lowered by these structural changes. Our findings underscore the utility of strategic modifications such as sulfur oxidation and fluorination in promoting this "helix-to-disc"&#160;conversion and opening new avenues for synthesizing functional polycyclic aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Syntheses of diarylmethanes via an oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives under quaternary ammonium hypoiodite catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report two strategies for the quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;mediated oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives. By using either dibenzoylperoxide or H2O2 in hexafluoroisopropanol in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide gives access to activated intermediates which can then be coupled with electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds. Overall, this sequential two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot procedure gives access to diversely decorated diarylmethane derivatives straightforwardly. Furthermore, the suitability of these products to undergo further oxidation reactions was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as an promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commerical applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity,&#160;large&#160;volume expansion and unstable soild&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low intial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance and short cycling lifepan. In this work, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx&#160;materials with lithium&#160;fluoride&#160;(LiF) modified by hydrothermal method and carbothermal&#160;modification. When the mass ratio of SiOx&#160;and LiF equals 1:0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention can be greatly improve form 30.2% to 76.7% after 200 cycles. The result is primarily&#160;because the enhancement&#160;of electrons and&#160;Li+&#8208;ions&#160;transport and&#160;the stability of SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition can hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presents the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx&#160;anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Irreversible Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation by Empolyment of Sarkosyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a widely used method for peptide and protein ligation due to ease of substrate preparation and fast enzymatic kinetics. But there are drawbacks that limit broader applications. Sorting motif in substrates may not be exposed to sortase efficiently due to folding or aggregation. In addition, the ligation is reversible under transpeptidation equilibrium that restricts ligation yield. Here we report a simple but robust method to overcome such limitations. By employment of sarkosyl, the detergent alters substrate conformation to raise sorting motif accessibility for sortase catalysis. Moreover, transpeptidation becomes irreversible presumably by formation of micelle to shield ligation products from sortase. In consequence, excellent yields were achieved from sortase variants with different substrate specificity. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), presenting a powerful approach for the conjugation of aggregation&#8208;prone substrates. Therefore, we believe the sarkosyl&#8208;enhanced SML could be widely applied in peptide and protein chemistry and the unique irreversible transpeptidation mechanism offers an insight to detergent&#8208;driven equilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs &#8211; semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Titanium Nitrido Complexes Containing A Linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti Core with A Two&#8208;Coordinate Nitrido Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of titanium m2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N = {(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8211;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiCl] (1&#8208;Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M = Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear m2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M = Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 2&#8208;Li, 2&#8208;Na, and 2&#8208;K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K contain a m2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na includes a m3&#8208;nitrido ligand as part of a T&#8208;shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, selective decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (3&#8208;M) (M = Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy&#8208;N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

The titanium azido complex [(Xy-N3N)TiN3] (1-N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy-N3N)TiCl] (1-Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M = Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear m2-nitrido complexes M[(Xy-N3N)Ti=N-Ti(Xy-N3N)] (2-M; M = Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 2-Li, 2-Na, and 2-K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state.

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a novel trinuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complex, along with two analogous mononuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complexes, are reported. All complexes displayed good selectivity in a human glioma cell line (T98G) when compared to a glial cell line (SVG p12), with low cytotoxicities. Superior tumor cell uptake for these Gd(III) complexes was observed at lower incubation concentrations compared to previously&#8208;reported delocalized lipophilic cations such as a rhodamine&#8208;lanthanoid (III) probe and Gd(III)&#8208;arylphosphonium complexes, with&#160;ca.&#160;150% and 250% increases in Gd uptake, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Analysis of (g,g', g'', &#8208; Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) Aryl ethers as a Polar Aliphatic Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A route is developed to (g,g&#8217;,g&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl&#160; substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8208;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their tert&#8208;butyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Impact on the Supramolecular Organization of Chiral Phthalimide EmittersDisplaying Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials has attracted an increasing attention in the recent years due to their potential application in various advancing technologies, notably in bioimaging and displays. In this context, heavy atoms such as halogen ones revealed useful tools to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of molecular organic phosphors. However, the effect of halogen at the supramolecular level remains less understood, especially in the field of molecular crystals where additional factors can impact the phosphorescence emission. Here, we investigate external effect of halogens on the phosphorescence of chiral phthalimides molecular crystals. The results show that changing the nature of the halogen atom onto the phthalimide core leads to an evolution of the photophysical properties of the materials which does not necessarily follow the classical trend imposed by the expected internal heavy atom effect. Beyond this aspect, we showed that the halogen atom has a profound impact on the packing between the chromophores at the supramolecular level which is of paramount importance towards the optical properties (PLQY and lifetimes) of the different phosphors examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Catalytic Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange of Free &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids.

         <title>Concentration controlling of carboxylic ester&#8208;based electrolyte for low temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low temperature has been a major challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to maintain satisfied electrochemical performance, and the main reason is the deactivation of electrolyte with the decreasing temperature. To address this point, in present work, we develop a low&#8208;temperature resistant electrolyte which includes ethyl acetate (EA) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as solvent and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) as the primary lithium salt. Due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB and FEC, a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF is formed on the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, contributing to higher stability and rapid desolvation of Li+ ions. The batteries with the optimized electrolyte can undergo cycling tests at &#8208;40 &#176;C, with a capacity retention of 83.9 % after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent compatibility with both LCO cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes, enabling a Gr/LCO battery to maintain a capacity retention of 90.3 % after multiple cycles at &#8208;25 &#176;C. This work proposes a cost&#8208;effective electrolyte that can activate potential LIBs in practical scenarios, especially in low&#8208;temperature environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Extended Aromatic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), including incorporation of &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks, &#960;&#8208;conjugation through highly conjugated linkages, as well as post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategies. Various approaches of growing films of such structures are also presented.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated materials are highly attractive owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a great opportunity for precise arrangement of building units in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline matrix and tuning of the properties through choice of functionalities or post&#8208;synthetic modification. With this review, we aim at summarizing both the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs. We give examples of direct synthesis using large, &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks. COFs featuring fully conjugated linkages such as vinylene, pyrazine, and azole are discussed. Then, post&#8208;synthetic modification methods that result in the extension of the COF &#960;&#8208;system are reviewed. Throughout, mechanistic insights are presented when available. In the context of their utilization as film devices, we conduct a concise survey of the prominent COF layer deposition techniques reported and their aptness for the deposition of fused aromatic systems.

         <title>Crystal to Hydrogel Transformation in S&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;Cysteine&#8208;Containing Cyclic Dipeptides &#8208; Nanostructure Elucidation and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine derived cyclic dipeptides containing different amino acid partners produce self&#8208;assembled structures, and their hydrogelation propensities are highly governed by the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains. The hydrogels produced by the cyclic dipeptides are thermoreversible, thixotropic, and have the ability to remove toxic dyes from contaminated water.







Abstract
Cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are crucial building blocks for a range of functional nanomaterials due to their simple chemical structure and high molecular stability. In this investigation, we synthesized a set of S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based CDPs (designated as P1&#8208;P6) and thoroughly examined their self&#8208;assembly behavior in a methanol&#8208;water solvent to elucidate the relationship between their structure and gelation properties. The hydrophobicity of the amino acids within the CDPs was gradually increased. The present study employed a comprehensive array of analytical techniques, including NMR, FT&#8208;IR, AFM, thioflavin&#8208;T, congo&#8208;red CD, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and biophysical calculations like Hirshfield Surface analysis and DFT analysis. These methods revealed that in addition to hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid side chain significantly influences the propensity of CDPs to form hydrogels. Each CDP yielded distinct nanofibrillar networks rich in &#946;&#8208;sheet structures, showcasing unique morphological features. Moreover, we explored the practical application of these CDP&#8208;based hydrogels in water purification by utilizing them to remove harmful organic dyes from contaminated water. This application underscores the potential of CDPs in addressing environmental challenges, offering a promising avenue for the future development of these materials in water treatment technologies.

         <title>Modulating Heavy Atom Effect in Germylene for Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CzGe and its derivatives CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu are a series of low&#8208;valent germylene&#8208;based pRTP molecules in which CzGe exhibits an unprecedented orange afterglow with an utralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and a high quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, resulting from a balanced ISC and HAE that has been confirmed by experimental observation and theoretical calculation.







Abstract
Abstract: It is worth but still challenging to develop the low&#8208;valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene&#8208;based persistent phosphors by introduction of low&#8208;valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors CzGe and its series of derivatives, namely CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low&#8208;valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled GeCz had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors. This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CzGe&lt;/b&gt; and its derivatives &lt;b&gt;CzGeS&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeSe&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeAu&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;CzGeCu&lt;/b&gt; are a series of low-valent germylene-based pRTP molecules in which &lt;b&gt;CzGe&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an unprecedented orange afterglow with an utralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and a high quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, resulting from a balanced ISC and HAE that has been confirmed by experimental observation and theoretical calculation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: It is worth but still challenging to develop the low-valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene-based persistent phosphors by introduction of low-valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors &lt;b&gt;CzGe&lt;/b&gt; and its series of derivatives, namely &lt;b&gt;CzGeS&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeSe&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeAu&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;CzGeCu&lt;/b&gt;, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low-valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled &lt;b&gt;GeCz&lt;/b&gt; had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors. This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen and Chalcogen Activation by Nucleophilic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high utility of halogenated organic compounds has prompted the development of numerous transformations that install the carbon&#8208;halogen motif. Halogen functionalities, deemed as "functional and functionalizable" molecules due to their capacity to modulate diverse internal properties, constitute a pivotal strategy in drug discovery and development. Traditional routes to these building blocks have commonly involved multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, and the use of stoichiometric and/or toxic reagents. With the emergence of solid halogen carriers such as N&#8208;halosuccinimides, and halohydantoins as popular sources of halonium ions, the past decade has witnessed enormous growth in the development of new catalytic strategies for halofunctionalization. This review aims to provide a nuanced perspective on nucleophilic activators and their roles in halogen activation. It will highlight critical discoveries in effecting racemic and asymmetric variants of these reactions, driven by the development of new catalysts, activation modes, and improved understanding of chemical reactivity and reaction kinetics</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Glycosylation&#8208;induced pathologic protein conformations as a tool to guide the selection of biologically active small molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications such as protein N&#8208;glycosylation, significantly influence cellular processes. Dysregulated N&#8208;glycosylation, exemplified in Grp94, a member of the Hsp90 family, leads to structural changes and the formation of epichaperomes, contributing to pathologies. Targeting N&#8208;glycosylation&#8208;induced conformations offers opportunities for developing selective chemical tools and drugs for these pathologic forms of chaperones. We here demonstrate how a specific Grp94 conformation induced by N&#8208;glycosylation, identified previously via molecular dynamics simulations, rationalizes the distinct behavior of similar ligands. Integrating dynamic ligand unbinding information with SAR development, we differentiate ligands productively engaging the pathologic Grp94 conformers from those that are not. Additionally, analyzing binding site stereoelectronic properties and QSAR models using cytotoxicity data unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting specific Grp94 conformations induced by abnormal glycosylation, selectively disrupting pathogenic protein networks while sparing normal mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>The Hydronaphthalide Monoanion: Isolation of the &#8220;red transient&#8221; Birch Intermediate from liquid Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birch reactions employing alkali metals in ammonia have been a well&#8208;established method for the reduction and functionalisation of aromatic compounds for nearly 100 years. Speculations regarding intermediates in the reaction pathway have been discussed since the beginning. We hereby report the isolation of NMe4(HNaph) (1), a kinetically trapped intermediate of the Birch reaction of naphthalene and sodium in liquid ammonia. 1 has been fully characterised and has been shown to continue to react to 1,2/1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene &#8211; the Birch product of the reduction of naphthalene. The reactivity of 1 was investigated towards activity as an electron and hydride transfer agent with both, elements and small organic molecules. 1 demonstrates a tamed reduction potential which allows for controlled reactions such as the selective formation of hexasulphide and hexaselenide anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Catalytic Site of Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 via Marine Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 (15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1) is a key enzyme that possesses an important role in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. The pocket of the enzyme plays the role of a chiral catalyst, and therefore chirality could be an important component for the design of effective enzyme inhibitors. To advance our knowledge on this concept, we developed a library of the identified chiral 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibitors and applied cheminformatic tools. Our analysis highlighted specific structural elements, which we integrated them in small molecules, and employed them as &#8220;smart&#8221; tools to effectively navigate the chemical space of previously unexplored regions. To this purpose, we utilized the marine derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) among with a small library of synthetic fragment derivatives, including a certain degree of stereochemical diversity. Enzyme inhibition/kinetic and molecular modelling studies has been performed in order to characterize structurally novel PE&#8208;based inhibitors, which proved to present a different type of inhibition with low micromolar potency, according to their structural features. We demonstrate that different warheads work as anchor, and either guide specific stereochemistry, or causing a time&#8208;depended inhibition. Finally, we prove that the positioning of the chiral substituents or/and the favorable stereochemistry can be crucial, as it can lead from active to completely inactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Building 3D Crosslinked Graphene&#8208;MXene Nanoarchitectures Decorated with MoS2 Quantum Dots Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although MoS2 quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom&#8208;up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene frameworks decorated with MoS2 quantum dots (MQD/RGO&#8208;MX) via a convenient co&#8208;assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO&#8208;MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso&#8208; and macropores, well&#8208;dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45 mV, a small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec&#8722;1 as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS2 quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inspired by the previous machine&#8208;learning study that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors, seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives 1a&#8211;g (NHBA = 5) were designed and synthesized by one&#8208;step functionalization from a common precursor. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses confirmed that the molecular arrangements of 1b (the diethyl and ethylthienyl derivative) and 1c (the di(n&#8208;propyl) and n&#8208;propylthienyl derivative) in the crystal are classified into brickwork structures with multidirectional intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer integrals, as a result of incorporation of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of 1b and 1c had hole mobilities of 0.16 and 0.029 cm2 V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Strategy and Doping Copper on Metal&#8208;organic Framework Surface for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous photocatalysts are characterized by numerous grain boundaries and abundant unsaturated sites, which enhance reaction efficiency from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. However, amorphization strategies have rarely been used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Doping copper onto a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surface can regulate the electronic structure of photocatalysts, promote electron transfer from the MOF to Cu, and improve the separation efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pairs. In this study, an amorphous photocatalyst MOFw&#8208;p/Cu containing highly dispersed Cu (0, I, II) sites was designed and synthesized by introducing a regulator and in situ copper species during the nucleation process of MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). Various characterizations confirmed that the Cu species were anchored to the organometallic skeleton of the surface amorphization MOF structure. The synergistic effect of Cu doping and surface amorphization in MOFw&#8208;p/Cu can significantly enhance the CO and CH4 yields while promoting the formation of the multicarbon product C2H4. The approach holds promise for developing novel, highly efficient MOFs as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction, enabling the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster &#8211; Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. We have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pyridylation of Alkynamides with Pyridylboronic Acids: A Route to Functionalized Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic direct hydroarylation of alkynamides is a highly efficient approach for accessing functionalized trisubstituted arylalkenes with amide groups. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids, yielding diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary enamides in good to excellent yields (up to 94%). This reaction demonstrates broad tolerance towards various alkyl and aryl functional groups, providing convenient access to a diverse array of alkenylpyridine derivatives. To demonstrate potential applications in late&#8208;stage hydropyridylation, we synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aldehydes, and esters with high yields from the pyridylation product of Weinreb amides. This indirect expansion of the substrate scope enhances the practicality of this strategy. Additionally, the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone obtained can be further reduced to yield a chiral alcohol with a 99% ee, further demonstrating the versatility and potential utility of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6 &#8208; 7.5% with ammonia yield rates of 300 &#8208; 340 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1.&#160; Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Aromaticity Be Evaluated Using Atomic Partitions Based on the Hilbert&#8208;Space?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8211; meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, NAO, and IAO &#8211; as reliable and economical alternatives to real&#8208;space partitions commonly used to measure aromaticity. These new partitions enable the study of larger molecular rings, previously limited by numerical integration errors in real&#8208;space partitions.







Abstract
Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry that explains the stability and reactivity of many compounds by identifying atoms within a molecule that form an aromatic ring. Reliable aromaticity indices focus on electron delocalization and depend on atomic partitions, which give rise to the concept of an atom&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;molecule (AIM). Real&#8208;space atomic partitions present two important drawbacks: a high computational cost and numerical errors, limiting some aromaticity measures to medium&#8208;sized molecules with rings up to 12 atoms. This restriction hinders the study of large conjugated systems like porphyrins and nanorings. On the other hand, traditional Hilbert&#8208;space schemes are free of the latter limitations but can be unreliable for the large basis sets required in modern computational chemistry. This paper explores AIMs based on three robust Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8211; meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, Natural Atomic Orbitals (NAO), and Intrinsic Atomic Orbitals (IAO) &#8211; which combine the advantages of real&#8208;space partitions without their disadvantages. These partitions can effectively replace real&#8208;space AIMs for evaluating the aromatic character. For the first time, we report multicenter index (MCI) and Iring values for large rings and introduce ESIpy, an open&#8208;source Python code for aromaticity analysis in large conjugated rings.

         <title>Probing the Electron Accepting Ability of Phosphaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron accepting ability of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide was systematically investigated by chemical and electrochemical methods as well as computational studies. Chemical reduction of phosphaphenalene by alkali metals leads to the formation of phosphaphenalenide anion. The successive reduction of pentavalent P&#8208;oxide gives rise to radical anion and dianion salts.







Abstract
Phosphaphenalenes, extended &#960; conjugates with the incorporation of phosphorus, are attractive avenues towards molecular materials for the applications in organic electronics, but their electron accepting ability have not been investigated. Herein we present systematic studies on the reductive behavior of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide by chemical and electrochemical methods. The chemical reduction of the phosphaphenalene by alkali metals reveals the facile P&#8722;C bond cleavage to form phosphaphenalenide anion, which functions as a transfer block for structure modification on the phosphorus atom. In contrast, the pentavalent P&#8208;oxide reacts with one or two equivalents of elemental sodium to form stable radical anion and dianion salts, respectively.

The chemical reduction of the phosphaphenalene by alkali metals reveals the facile P&#8722;C bond cleavage to form phosphaphenalenide anion, which functions as a transfer block for structure modification on the phosphorus atom. In contrast, the pentavalent P-oxide reacts with one or two equivalents of elemental sodium to form stable radical anion and dianion salts, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfones, Sulfonamides and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has encouraged chemists to discover new synthetic transformations in a more effective, mild, and safe manner. This Perspective critically analyses the most relevant photocatalytic strategies on the chemistry of sulfur (VI) compounds, with particular emphasis on sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfoximines. Based on selected examples, future directions within the field are presented. Finally, open synthetic challenges along with possible future solutions are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;based functional groups are popular scaffolds in a wide variety of research fields including synthetic and medicinal chemistry, as well as chemical biology. The growing interest in sulfur(VI)&#8208;containing molecules has motivated the scientific community to explore new methods to synthesize and modify them. Here, photocatalysis plays a key role granting access to new types of reactivity under mild reaction conditions. In this Perspective, we present a selection of works reported in the last six years focused on the photocatalytic assembly and reactivity of sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfoximines. We addressed the key synthetic intermediates for each transformation, while discussing limitations and strength points of the protocols. Future directions of the field are finally presented.

         <title>Highly Efficient Quenching of Singlet Oxygen by DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DNA origami nanostructures is investigated in an antimicrobial photodynamic therapy setting, using light irradiation of methylene blue to generate a mixture of radicals and singlet oxygen. DNA origami nanostructures are found to be vastly superior to genomic double&#8208;stranded DNA and established ROS scavengers in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage.







Abstract
DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their scavenging efficiency toward ROS radicals was shown to be comparable to that of genomic DNA. Herein, we demonstrate that DONs are highly efficient singlet oxygen quenchers outperforming double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA by several orders of magnitude. To this end, a ROS mixture rich in singlet oxygen is generated by light irradiation of the photosensitizer methylene blue and its cytotoxic effect on Escherichia coli cells is quantified in the presence and absence of DONs. DONs are found to be vastly superior to dsDNA in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage and even surpass established ROS scavengers. At a concentration of 15&#8197;nM, DONs are about 50&#8201;000 times more efficient ROS scavengers than dsDNA at an equivalent concentration. This is attributed to the dominant role of singlet oxygen, which has a long diffusion length and reacts specifically with guanine. The dense packing of the available guanines into the small volume of the DON increases the overall quenching probability compared to a linear dsDNA with the same number of base pairs. DONs thus have great potential to alleviate oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings.

         <title>Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis on the Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction of Aminochalcone: Catalytic Performance and Chalcogen Bond Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several mono&#8208;/bis&#8208;dentate hypervalent chalcogen bond donors were applied to catalyze the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The electron density of the chalcogen bond, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process and can be used to predict the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non&#8208;covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono&#8208;dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB1 was comparable to that of bis&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB4, and stronger than that of mono&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB2 and ChB3. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8722;C&#8722;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction. The electron density of the chalcogen bond of the pre&#8208;complex, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process, which provides an idea to predict the catalytic activity of the ChB catalysis.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Benzophenazine Derivatives for Homogeneous and Heterogenized Photooxygenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new familly of benzophenazine derivatives was designed as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. Extensive structure activity relationship was carried out using both experimental and theoretical approach. The most promising candidate was immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen is a powerful oxidant used in various applications, such as organic synthesis, medicine, and environmental remediation. Organic and inorganic photosensitizers are commonly used to generate this reactive species through energy transfer with the triplet ground state of oxygen. We describe here a series of novel benzophenazine derivatives as a promising class of photosensitizers for singlet oxygen photosensitization. In this study, we investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of these benzophenazine derivatives. Akin to a molecular compass, the southern fragment was first functionalized with either aromatic tertiary amines, alkyl tertiary amines, aromatic sulfur groups, alkyl sulfur groups, or cyclic ethers. Enhanced photophysical properties (in terms of triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime, absorption wavelength, triplet state energy, and O2 quenching capabilities) were obtained with cyclic ether and sulfur groups. Conversely, the presence of an amine moiety was detrimental to the photocatalysts. The western and northern fragments were also investigated and slightly undesirable to negligible changes in photophysical properties were observed. The most promising candidate was then immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation reaction. A high NMR yield of 97&#8201;% in desired product was obtained, with only a slight decrease over several recycling runs (85&#8201;% in the fourth run). These results provide insights into the design of efficient photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation and the development of heterogeneous systems.

         <title>A Photoredox Thiol&#8208;yne Reaction for the Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Coumarins and its Effect on Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;compatible, photoredox&#8208;based synthesis of fluorescent coumarins, bearing a vinyl sulfide as an electron&#8208;donating group, was developed; subsequently, the photophysical properties of these derivatives were examined.







Abstract
Coumarins still remain one of the most widely explored fluorescent dyes, with a broad spectrum of applications spanning various fields, such as molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, or medical sciences. Their fluorescence is strongly based on a push&#8208;pull mechanism involving an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), mainly located at the C7 or C8 positions of the dye core. Unfortunately, up to now, these positions have been very limited to hydroxyl or amino groups. In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol&#8208;yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium&#8208; or porphyrin&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late&#8208;stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in a single&#8208;step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;benzothiazole, 6&#8211;8&#8208;difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204&#8197;nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.

In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol-yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium- or porphyrin-based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late-stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof-of-concept study, in a single-step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 3-benzothiazole, 6&#8211;8-difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204&#8197;nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Structural Motif in Aggregation of Methylalumoxanes: Non&#8208;hydrolytic Route by the Alkylation of Dicarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alumoxanes are typically produced via controlled hydrolysis of short&#8208;chain alkyl aluminium compounds which leads to oligomeric species that are usually difficult to obtain in crystalline form. Simultaneously, various alternative non&#8208;hydrolytic approaches to alumoxanes have also been used. In this work, we report on a&#160;new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a&#160;series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO2CCH2C(=CH2)CO2H), succinic acid (HO2CCH2CH2CO2H) and homophthalic acid (HO2CCH2C6H4CO2H). The reactions of AlMe3 with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4:1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me10Al6O4, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe3 in the 1:2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [(homophtalate)(AlMe2)2]2. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple protein modifications are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modifications of proteins are inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for protein dual functionalization. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Selective Anticancer Mechanisms: Dinuclear Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics Combined with Pt(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We exploration the in vitro activities of the dinuclear&#160;Mn2L2Ac&#160;and&#160;Mn2L2&#160;complexes (where HL = 2&#8208;{[di(2&#8208;pyridyl)methylamino]&#8208;methyl}phenol), possessing dual superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, both individually and in conjunction with various Pt(II)&#8208;complexes, either as mixtures or as&#160;the&#160;Mn2&#8208;Pt&#160;adducts. Our findings revealed a notable up to 50% enhancement in the viability of healthy human breast cells, contrasted with a viability decrease as low as 50% in breast cancer cells upon combined treatments with&#160;Mn2&#160;SOD mimics and Pt(II) complexes.&#160;Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the self&#8208;assembled&#160;Mn2&#8208;Pt&#160;adducts&#160;(isolated&#160;Mn2L2Pt&#160;and&#160;in situ&#160;Mn2L2Pt&#8217;), linking&#160;Mn2L2&#8208;core with the carboxylate group of&#160;PtDAPCl2&#160;(dichloro(2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid) platinum(II)). The SOD activity of the isolated&#160;Mn2L2Pt&#160;adduct (kSOD&#160;= 1.7 &#215; 107&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) remained intact. We elucidated key mechanisms underlying the observed biological effects.&#160;We demonstrated that&#160;Mn2&#8208;containing formulations predominantly target mitochondrial processes, differently affecting the proteome of cancerous and healthy cells. They induced downregulation of H2S signaling and expression of mitochondrial complex I and III, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation pathways and upregulation of EGFR in cancer cells. In contrast, healthy cells showed a decrease in EGFR expression and a moderate enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1:2 mol mol&#8211;1) and ChCl/urea (1:2 mol mol&#8211;1), these reactions yield up to 97% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12 h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure&#8217;s eco&#8208;friendliness is validated&#160; by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between aldehydes or ketones and alkynes &#8211;the carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8211; constitutes a very useful strategy for the synthesis of a,b&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now demonstrate that iodine is a highly efficient catalyst for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular metathesis reaction in very small concentrations (0.1&#8211;1 mol%). Our protocol outperforms other catalytic systems, is operationally very simple, cheap, metal&#8208;free, and tolerates a large variety of functional groups (e.g., &#8211;CN, &#8211;CO2Me, &#8211;Br, &#8211;OH) at very low catalyst loadings. We can furthermore show that iodine&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metatheses can be combined with other iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one&#8208;pot procedures to afford larger and more complex molecular structures. Finally, our mechanistic studies indicate that the iodonium ion is the active catalyst under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>
