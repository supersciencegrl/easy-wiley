         <title>The Chemical Recovery of PMMA into Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), commonly known as plexiglass, is widely used in the areas of aircraft, automobile, construction and transplants, due to its high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance, and excellent compatibility with human tissue. With the increase in production and usage of PMMA, the vast accumulation of PMMA waste has posed a challenge to the recycling of PMMA waste. However, at present, only less than 10% of PMMA is recycled each year. The cost&#8208;effective chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer with high efficiency has attracted wide attention and has become one of the hot research subjects. The chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer are realized mainly via two approaches, including the pyrolysis of common PMMA at high temperature and the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions. The second approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years. Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer. Firstly, the pyrolysis of general PMMA at high temperature is illustrated by typical research works. Subsequently, the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions is highlighted and discussed, as this approach is more in line with the green and sustainable development of polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Insights on Gas Trapping of Noble Gases in MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Type Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, with anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;), were synthesized for noble gas storage. Selecting the side ligand type fine&#8208;tuned the pore aperture size, effectively controlling gas entry and release. Experiments with krypton and xenon were complemented by computational modeling.







Abstract
Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, in which the pore apertures are defined by anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, respectively), were synthesized and loaded with noble gases. By selecting the type of side ligand, one can fine&#8208;tune the pore aperture size, allowing for precise regulation of the entry and release of gas guests. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine gas loading and release using krypton and xenon as model gases, and we complemented our findings with computational modeling. Remarkably, the loaded gas guests remained trapped inside the pores even after being exposed to air under ambient conditions for extended periods, in some cases for up to several weeks. Therefore, we focused on determining the energy barrier preventing gas release using both theoretical and experimental methods. The results were compared in relation to the types of hosts and guests, providing valuable insights into the gas trapping process in MOFs, as well as programmed gas release in air under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the crystal structure of MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br was elucidated using the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) technique, and the bulk purity of the sample was subsequently verified through Rietveld refinement.

         <title>Double Strain&#8208;Release (3+3)&#8208;Cycloaddition: Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reaction of Bicyclobutane Carboxylates and Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butane carboxylates with protected aziridines. In this transformation, highly functionalized 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are accessed in single step under mild conditions. This is an example of strain&#8208;release driven transformation, where two highly strained rings combine to form bicyclic moieties which can serve as potential bioisosteres.







Abstract
A (3+3)&#8208;cycloaddition to afford 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes was realized by reacting highly strained aryl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCBs) carboxylates with tosylated aziridines. Under Sc(OTf)3 catalysis the transformation proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to the corresponding bicyclic products bearing at the bridgeheads of the embedded four&#8208;membered ring aryl and ester moieties, respectively. This reaction is a rare example of a cycloaddition of two highly strained ring systems under Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanistic experiments provided insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Scalable Production of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scaling&#8208;up process of a continuous injection protocol used to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions is described. Synthesis and processing were controlled with special attention to increasing synthesis yield and controlling product quality.







Abstract
This work describes the scalability process of a continuous&#8208;injection protocol employed to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions. Different levels of manipulation starting from the synthesis and processing also related to the tuning of the optical response (considering the peculiar combination of UV and NIR absorption with visible transparency) make these materials incredibly versatile. But one of the most attractive features concern the modulation of their charge carrier density through chemical or post&#8208;synthetic doping, as for the case of core&#8208;shell materials, expanding the properties of the core composition. In addition, the colloidal nature of such materials allows for easy solution processing which enables an extensive use in different applications within current thin films base technologies. It is therefore important to push forward the lab&#8208;scale synthesis to properly address the commercial fabrication requirements without any loss in quality. Uniformity is crucial for industrial applications, ensuring predictable performance and facilitating the integration of these nanoparticles into optoelectronic devices. The method here developed allowed a transition from mg&#8208;scale to gram&#8208;scale product mass outputs, while retaining stability in terms of particle size distribution, morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties. This research establishes a robust framework for the scalable production of metal oxide nanoparticles with consistent properties, enhancing their viability for widespread use in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We take a look into the mechanism of glycosylation by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation. Despite these glycosylation taking place without any additives, a complex mechanistic pathway is revealed through both kinetic experiments, computational studies, and competition experiments.







Abstract
In this study, the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings, the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate. According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity arises from the associated nature of all intermediates formed throughout the reaction. During the mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile is present.

         <title>Exploring Glycan&#8208;Lectin Interactions in Natural&#8208;Like Environments: A View Using NMR Experiments Inside Cell and on Cell Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR methods are applied to uncover molecular recognition events between synthetic glycan molecules and lectin receptors within the cell and on the cell surface. The interaction between 15&#8197;N&#8208;labelled human galectin&#8208;7 with thioglycoside is monitored within living Danio rerio oocytes using HMQC experiments, while the binding epitope of a sialoside ligand to human Siglec&#8208;10, at the surface of HEK293F cells, is unraveled by STD&#8208;NMR.







Abstract
Glycan&#8208;mediated molecular recognition events are essential for life. NMR is widely used to monitor glycan binding to lectins in solution using isolated glycans and lectins. In this context, we herein explore diverse NMR methodologies, from both the receptor and ligand perspectives, to monitor glycan&#8208;lectin interactions under experimental conditions mimicking the native milieu inside cells and on cell surface. For the NMR experiments inside cells, galectin&#8208;7 is employed as model, since most galectins are soluble and carry out their functions in the cellular micro&#8208;environment. Using Danio Rerio oocytes, the 1H&#8208;15N HMQC NMR spectrum of a folded galectin has been observed inside cell for the first time, using a glycomimetic ligand (TDG) to overcoming the natural tendency of galectins to bind to numerous galactose&#8208;containing receptors within cells. Alternatively, most lectins, other than galectins, are displayed on the cell surface, providing a multivalent presentation to bind their glycan partners in cis (at the same cell) or in trans (on other cells). In this case, ligand&#8208;based STD&#8208;NMR experiments have been successfully applied to account for the interactions of natural glycans and glycomimetics with Siglec&#8208;10. These methodologies provide the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to open the door to the NMR analysis of the recognition of glycans in native&#8208;like settings.

         <title>Role of Secondary Structure and Time&#8208;Dependent Binding on Disruption of Phthalocyanine Aggregates by Guanine&#8208;Rich Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids to a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure zinc phthalocyanine (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GpG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates to disperse the monomeric state. Time&#8208;dependent binding is observed for all systems, especially poly(G). Such biomacromolecule interactions are expected to be important when rationalizing the photoactivity of phthalocyanines in&#8208;vivo.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are versatile photodynamic therapy agents whose biological activity depends on their aggregation state, which is expected to be influenced by binding to biomolecules. Here, guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid binding of a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure C4h zinc phthalocyanine bearing four triethylene glycol methyl ether and four N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium substituents (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA are shown to effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates in buffered solution. This process is accompanied by evolution of the Q&#8208;band absorbance and enhanced emission. Increasing the sequence length from GpG to (GG)10 increases the binding and confirms the importance of multiple binding interactions. Enhanced binding in the presence of KCl suggests the importance of nucleobase hydrogen&#8208;bonded mosaics in phthalocyanine binding. Notably, the (GT)10 sequence is even more effective than quadruplex and pure guanine systems at disrupting the aggregates of 1. Significant time&#8208;dependent binding of 1 with poly(G) reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of poly(G) that accommodate monomers of 1 over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in&#8208;vivo.

         <title>Synthesis of an Unsymmetrical Dialumane and Kinetic Analysis of its Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsymmetrical dialumane was synthesized by the reaction of a nucleophilic alumanyl anion with a bromoalumane and structurally characterized to show the existence of the Et2O&#8208;coordination to the Al atom. Its reactivity toward ethylene and styrene into the Al&#8722;Al bond was examined, and the resulting insertion products underwent subsequent reactions. The reaction of the dialumane with styrene was decelerated by the presence of additional Et2O, suggesting that an Et2O dissociation occurred before the alkene insertion, which can be distinguished from an associative mechanism involving a five&#8208;coordinated Al intermediate.

         <title>Aqueous Dispersion of Xenes by Liquid Phase Exfoliation of Monoelemental Crystals in Melamine Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismouth, silicon, tellurium and tin powders are effectively exfoliated in water solution of melamine affording 2D nanostructures. These characteristic 2D Xenes are dispersed in water forming stable colloidal solutions.







Abstract
&#913;fter the impressive evolution of graphene and its derivatives, a large number of two dimensional (2D) materials with important optical and electrical properties have been successfully fabricated. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of layered and non&#8208;layered materials has become a widely applied method for the preparation of 2D nanostructures with an extensive variety of applications. However, in most cases organic solvents are used as liquid phase which are often toxic and environmentally unfriendly and lead to low yields. In this work, we present water as a suitable liquid phase and dispersion medium for the exfoliation of layered and non&#8208;layered monoelemental solids from IVA, VA and VIA groups of the periodic table, such as silicon, tin, bismuth and tellurium. The 2D nanostructures, silicene, stanene, bismuthene and tellurene are therefore prepared by a completely sustainable and environmentally friendly method. The prepared Xenes, as they are called, are fully characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>Switch of Five Contiguous Chiral Centers in the Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Hajos&#8211;Parrish Ketone Analogs via Diphenylprolinol Silyl Ether&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five continuous chiral centers were switched with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, which is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction. Both enantiomers of the functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone analogs were synthesized in the domino reaction using the same chiral organocatalyst under two slightly different conditions. Mechanism of the enantiodivergency was clarified.







Abstract
Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one&#8208;pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the configuration at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.

Both enantiomers of the functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone analogs were synthesized in the domino reaction using the same chiral organocatalyst under two slightly different conditions. Mechanism of the enantiodivergency was clarified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one-pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the configuration at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A highly diastereo&#8208; and enatioselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. This method enables the synthesis of spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 97&#8201;%) diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8197;dr) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2 e.r.) under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. With simple Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, such as para&#8208;toluene sulfonic acid, spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers are formed in high yields (up to 97&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8197;dr) under mild reaction conditions. With the use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of the corresponding spiroisoindolinones was achieved. Mechanistic investigations indicate a step&#8208;wise mechanism via an initial addition of the enamide to an electrophilic N&#8208;acylimine species followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Addition of a strong Lewis acid can be used to facilitate the second step for less reactive substrates.

         <title>Harnessing Cyanine&#8208;like Properties to Develop Bright Fluorogenic Probes Based on Viscosity&#8208;Sensitive Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Playing on the electron&#8208;donor strength increases the absorptivity of hemicyanines, reaching cyanine&#8208;like photophysical properties. The resulting bright fluorescent molecular rotor can be used to develop fluorogenic probes for bioimaging. In particular, HaloTag fluorogens with increased brightness thanks to the improved absorption are obtained to label membrane proteins with high contrast in wash&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Dipolar fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) are environmentally&#8208;sensitive fluorophores that can be used in bioimaging applications to sense local viscosity and polarity. Their sensitivity to viscosity can also be used for the fluorogenic labeling of biomolecules such as DNA or proteins. In particular, we have previously used FMRs to develop a series of tunable fluorogens targeting the self&#8208;labeling protein tag Halotag for wash&#8208;free protein imaging in live cells. Despite these very useful properties, FMRs typically display moderate molar absorption coefficients that limits their overall fluorescence brightness. Herein, we synthesized a series of three model hemicyanines based on a styrylindolenium scaffold and performed a detailed study of their photophysical properties in solvents with various polarity and viscosity. We show that with a strong julolidine electron&#8208;donating group it is possible to combine intense cyanine&#8208;like absorption with the high sensitivity to viscosity of FMRs. We use this property to develop a lysosomal pH sensor and two bright cell&#8208;impermeant fluorogens targeting HaloTag for imaging membrane proteins. We believe that this bright fluorogenic scaffold based on a simple chemical structure can be used in the future to build up a variety of probes and sensors with efficient photophysical properties.

         <title>Influence of Ionic Liquid Film Thickness and Flow Rate on Macrocyclization Efficiency and Selectivity in Supported Ionic Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic setup consisting of a supported ionic liquid film situated on the inner surface of a mesoporous material and an organic transport phase, creates a liquid confinement that offers control over the spatial restraints in which a catalytic reaction occurs. Atomistic simulations are conducted and correlated with experimental observations to elucidate the molecular processes at the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase.







Abstract
Supported ionic&#8208;liquid phase (SILP) technology in a biphasic setting with n&#8208;heptane as the transport phase was applied to the Ru&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed macrocyclization of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dienes to elucidate the effect of ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;film thickness, flow rate as well as substrate and product concentration on macrocyclization efficiency, and Z&#8208;selectivity. To understand the molecular&#8208;level behavior of the substrates and products at the n&#8208;heptane/IL interphase, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were conducted and correlated with experimental observations. The thickness of the IL layer strongly influences the Z/E ratio of the products in that a thin IL layer favors higher Z/E ratios by confining the catalyst between the pore wall and the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase whereas a thick IL layer favors formation of the E&#8208;product and Ru&#8208;hydride catalyzed isomerization reactions. Also, macrocyclization efficiency, expressed by the ratio of oligomers/macromonocycle (O/MMC), is influenced both by the flow rate and the thickness of the IL layer.

         <title>Carbon Monoxide and Alkoxycarbonyl Radical Enabled Migration Strategy for the Carbonylative Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents has been developed. The reaction proceeds through by the relay of carbon monoxide through the non&#8208;classical intramolecular functional group migration skeleton.







Abstract
Herein we report a &#8220;carbonylative migration&#8221; strategy for the acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents. The transformation is proceeded by the alkoxycarbonyl radical addition to unactivated alkenes, followed by the insertion of carbon monoxide to induce intramolecular migration of heteroaryl groups, which is different from the traditional reaction modes. The reaction conditions were mild and well tolerated with varieties of functional groups. A variety of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with different ester groups were produced easily which has high potential applications in biology, medicine, and other fields.

         <title>New Concept on the Generation and Regulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention because of its significant application prospect across multiple fields of three&#8208;dimensional display, data storage, and information encryption. Chirality and luminescence are two necessary prerequisites for the generation of CPL. However, controlling these two factors simultaneously in a rational manner remains a challenge. Herein, we highlight the recent advances in&#160;the rational generation and regulation of CPL through the new concept, named matching rules, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication between excited state and ground state. An important commonality among these strategies is that they need a good overlap of the corresponding spectra between the luminescent part (fluorescence, phosphorescence, or CPL) and the chiral part (organic, inorganic, or organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials), which can be contactless and separate. Different from most previous studies, no covalent or noncovalent interactions between the two parts are required, which makes them more facile and convenient. Finally, we summarize the main advantages of these strategies and the current challenges. We expect this concept to offer insightful and novel understanding and inspiration on CPL generation and regulation.</dc:description>

Herein, we highlight the recent advances in&#160;the rational generation and regulation of CPL through the new concept, named matching rules, mainly including fluorescence-selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication between excited state and ground state. An important commonality among these strategies is that they need a good overlap of the corresponding spectra between the luminescent part (fluorescence, phosphorescence, or CPL) and the chiral part (organic, inorganic, or organic-inorganic hybrid materials), which can be contactless and separate. Different from most previous studies, no covalent or noncovalent interactions between the two parts are required, which makes them more facile and convenient. Finally, we summarize the main advantages of these strategies and the current challenges. We expect this concept to offer insightful and novel understanding and inspiration on CPL generation and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Designs and Applications of Tetraphenylethylene Macrocycles and Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles and cages are very attractive for the development of functional materials due to their unique inner cavities. Building blocks with interesting functions and synthetic conveniences are especially attractive. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is such an entity with C2 symmetry and tetrakis&#8208;functional groups easily modifiable. As a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active compound, TPE perfectly unites the functions of fluorescence and structural building blocks together. The unique marriage of the two roles into one component makes TPE an ideal platform for the development of functional molecular systems including macrocycles and cages. The TPE macrocycles and cages are not merely a simple combination of those two but also generate added values unseen in either component alone. The fluorescence properties of TPE in macrocycles/cages are greatly improved or modulated, which makes them more suitable for various applications compared to their linear counterparts. In this review, the chemistry and design principles of TPE macrocycles/cages are surveyed first. The unique properties of those compounds are also discussed to provide general guidance for their functionalization. A brief discussion of their applications focusing on the utilization of their unique fluorescence is also presented. In the last, outlooks and future perspectives of TPE macrocycles/cages are provided for further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of Fluorinated Prolines into Proteins and their Impact on Neighbouring Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of fluorinated amino acids into proteins provides new opportunities to study biomolecular structure&#8208;function relationships in an elegant manner. The available strategies to incorporate the majority of fluorinated amino acids are not site&#8208;specific or imply important structural modifications. Here, we present a chemical biology approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of three commercially available C&#947;&#8208;modified fluoroprolines that has been validated using a non&#8208;pathogenic version of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 (HttExon&#8208;1). 19F, 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts measured for multiple variants of HttExon&#8208;1 indicated that the trans/cis ratio was strongly dependent on the fluoroproline variant and the sequence context. By isotopically labelling the rest of the protein, we have shown that the extent of spectroscopic perturbations to the neighbouring residues depends on the number of fluorine atoms and the stereochemistry at C&#947;, as well as the isomeric form of the fluoroproline. We have rationalized these observations by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that the observed atomic chemical shift perturbations correlate with the distance to fluorine atoms and that the effect remains very local. These results validate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines as an excellent strategy to monitor intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions in disordered proline&#8208;rich proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pair of Dinuclear Fe(II) Enantiomers: Syntheses and Structures of &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;Bis(Dihydridoborate) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In our effort to establish a direct synthetic approach for bis(dihydridoborate) complexes of first&#8208;row transition metals, we have investigated the reactivity of [Cp*Fe(dppe)Cl] (dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) with Na[BH3L] (L = 2&#8208;mercaptopyridine (mp) and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (mbz)) that led to the formation of iron(II) dihydridoborate complexes, [Cp*Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(L))}] 1a&#8208;b (L = mp (1a) and L = mbz (1b)). Further, in an attempt to isolate the bis(dihydridoborate) complex of iron by the insertion of borane into the &#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2] (2), we have isolated and structurally characterized a rare example of dimeric iron bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2]2, &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 as pair of enantiomers. Interestingly, these enantiomers &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 have two trans&#8208;[Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2] moieties bridged through sulfur atoms of 2&#8208;mercaptopyridinyl ligands, where the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated. The natural bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses of &#923;&#916;&#8208;3 and &#916;&#923;&#8208;3 show considerable electron donation from the filled &#963;B&#8208;H bonding orbital to vacant&#160;dz2&#160;orbital of iron with a substantial contribution from the hydrogen atoms. The localized orbital bonding analyses (LOBA) method suggests that all the iron centres are in +2 oxidation state.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides and group 13 Lewis acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides [K(18c6)PnH2] (Pn = P, As) and Trialkylgallanes (GaMe3, GaEt3, GatBu3) as well as BH3 were synthesized. In the course of these investigations, we were able to fully characterize a row of compounds of the type [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8209;2][PnH2(ER3)2] (E = B: R = H; E = Ga: R = Me, Et, tBu). Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8209;2][Pn(SiMe3)2(ER3)n] (n = 1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe3)2] (Pn = P and As) and ER3 (E = B, Al, In: R = Me; E = Ga: R= Me, Et, tBu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra&#8208;red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH2]&#8722; and [Pn(SiMe3)2]&#8722; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Access to Pyrrolo&#8208; and (Aryl)Indolo&#8208;Fused Phenazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel fused phenazines were synthesized through a combination of gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cascade cyclization reactions towards azaacenes. In total, 30 new compounds were synthesized and investigated with respect to their structural and optoelectronic properties. In solution, these targets exhibit strong green to red emission, with quantum yields of up to 60%. The emission wavelength can be finely adjusted by the choice of solvent due to their solvatochromic behavior, as demonstrated with a representative example.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning of a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework by Liquid&#8208;Assisted Mechanosynthesis between trans&#8208;Aconitic Acid and Isonicotinamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cocrystallization of trans&#8208;aconitic acid (TACA) and isonicotinamide (INA) using liquid assisted mechanochemical grinding results in a unique supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system encapsulating various organic solvents (liquid guest) with the formation of channel inclusion compounds. Dimension and shape of the framework is dependent on the solvent used during liquid assisted grinding (LAG). Although crystal structure of the cocrystal (TACA)&#8226;(INA)2&#8226;(H2O)@(INA)0.5 has been determined by Single Crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), crystal structures of 3 cocrystal HOFs were determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction due to lack of suitable single crystal. PXRD analysis confirms isostructurality of various host&#8208;guest systems; whereas guest incorporation as well as stability of the HOFs were further confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis. This study demonstrates that the framework of HOFs can be tuned by varying solvent molecules used during LAG.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;fluorinated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents is reported. Systematic additive effects of introducing O&#8208; and gem&#8208;CF2 group introduction on acidic properties (pKa) of the corresponding carboxylic acids / protonated primary amines was demonstrated. The impact of the O/CF2 moieties on lipophilicity (LogP) were found to be complex; significant mutual influence of the corresponding polar moieties governed the compound&#8217;s overall properties in this case.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;based Linkers for Tunable Acid&#8208;Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core&#8208;crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl&#8208;based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half&#8208;life (t1/2) of native gemcitabine from &lt;1 hour to &gt;96 hours at pH 5.0 at 37&#176;C, compared to a t1/2 of 24 to &gt;240 hours at pH 7.4 at 37&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t1/2 at pH 5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fabrication of ZIF&#8208;L Derived Zns/Mos2@NC Anode Materials for Remarkable Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ZnMo&#8208;ZIF&#8722;L precursors was achieved by introducing a Mo source in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio during ZIF&#8722;L synthesis. Subsequent to high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance.







Abstract
The enhancement of electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries can be achieved through the incorporation of MoS2 with carbon materials and various metal sulfides. In this study, a ZnS/MoS2 heterostructure was developed, featuring a two&#8208;dimensional nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (NC) backbone. The synthesis of ZnMoZIF&#8722;L precursors was accomplished by introducing a Mo source in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio during the ZIF&#8722;L synthesis process. Following high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance. At a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity capacity is still as high as 1674&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, this composite material demonstrates optimal rate capabilities and a significant contribution to pseudocapacitance. The nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon framework effectively mitigates volume changes, while the heterostructural design provides more active sites for lithium&#8208;ions, thereby enhancing lithium storage performance.

Molecular docking and dynamics and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations allowed us to monitor interaction with different DNA sequences of simple cationic porphyrins. 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin bromide in particular demonstrated a better selectivity compared to tetramethylpyridylporphyrin in binding G&#8208;quadruplex with parallel topology compared with hybrid and with duplex forming oligonucleotides.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s), as non&#8208;canonical DNA structures, attract a great deal of research interest in the molecular biology as well as in the material science fields. The use of small molecules as ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes has emerged as a tool to regulate gene expression and telomeres maintenance. Meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl) porphyrin (TMPyP4) was shown as one of the first ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes and it is still widely used. We report an investigation comprising molecular docking and dynamics, synthesis and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations on simple cationic porphyrins and their interaction with different DNA sequences. This study enabled the synthesis of tetracationic porphyrin derivatives that exhibited binding and stabilizing capacity against G&#8208;quadruplex structures; the detailed characterization has shown that the presence of amide groups at the periphery improves selectivity for parallel G4&#8197;s binding over other structures. Taking into account the ease of synthesis, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl) porphyrin bromide could be considered a better alternative to TMPyP4 in studies involving G4 binding.

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Encoded Molecules: A Minimal Self&#8208;Replicator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal donor&#8208;acceptor heterodimer, based on hydrogen bonding recognition, exhibits self&#8208;replicating behaviour through imine formation between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers. This further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, with their unique duplex structure, which is key for information replication, have sparked interest in self&#8208;replication's role in life's origins. Early template&#8208;based replicators, initially built on short oligonucleotides, expanded to include peptides and synthetic molecules. We explore here the potential of a class of synthetic duplex&#8208;forming oligoanilines, as self&#8208;replicators. We have recently developed oligoanilines equipped with 2&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol&#8211;phosphine oxide H&#8208;bond base pairs and we investigate whether the imine formed between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers can self&#8208;replicate. Despite lacking a clear sigmoidal kinetic profile, control experiments with a methylated donor and a competitive inhibitor support self&#8208;replication. Further investigations with the reduced aniline dimer demonstrate templated synthesis, revealing a characteristic parabolic growth. After showing sequence selective duplex formation, templated synthesis and the emergence of catalytic function, the self&#8208;replication behaviour further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.

A Ca/Li co&#8208;doped P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode material was synthesized through a simple sol&#8208;gel method. With the synergistic effect of Ca&#8208;doping at Na sites and Li substitution at transition metal sites, the obtained cathode material attains an excellent electrochemical performance due to the inhibited P2&#8208;O2 phase transition and improved ion diffusion.







Abstract
P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxide Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is considered as a promising cathode for advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the P2&#8208;type cathode suffers severe P2&#8208;O2 phase transition during cycling process, resulting unsatisfactory cyclic stability and rate capability. Herein, a Ca/Li co&#8208;doped P2&#8208;type Na0.62Ca0.05Ni0.33Mn0.57Li0.10O2 (NCNMLO) cathode material was synthesized through a simple sol&#8208;gel method. With the synergistic effect of Ca&#8208;doping at Na sites and Li substitution at transition metal (TM) sites, the cathode achieves an excellent electrochemical performance due to the inhibited P2&#8208;O2 phase transition and improved ion diffusion with Na+/vacancy disordering arrangement. The NCNMLO cathode exhibits a good cyclic stability with 70.8&#8201;% of capacity retention at 1&#8197;C after 200 cycles and excellent rate capability with 40.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C. The dual sites doping strategy provides an effective and simple approach for designing high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Highly Efficient Detection of Pd2+ in Aqueous Medium by an Elusive Mn(II) Coordination Polymer</title>

Efficient and selective detection of Pd2+ in aqueous medium with exceptionally low limit of detection (LOD) within wide ranges of pH and higher binding constant values by a newly designed Mn(II) based 1D coordination polymer.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a Mn(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer (CP); and its structure, phase consistency and thermal stability have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA) respectively. This is the first example of paramgnetic Mn(II)&#8208;based CP that acts as pH&#8208;dependent emitting material [&#955;em=525&#8197;nm (pH=2.0&#8211;4.0) and 450&#8197;nm (pH=5.0&#8211;12.0)]. Its emission is quenched by Pd2+ in aqueous medium in presence of other thirteen cations with reasonably low pH&#8208;dependent limits of detection (LODs) [21.178&#8197;ppb (pH=3), 15.005&#8197;ppb (pH=7.0) and 59.940&#8197;ppb (pH=10.0)] as described by well&#8208;established mechanism. Therefore, urgency of such stable sensor remains high in regard to the environmental pollution.

         <title>Effective Synthesis of C20&#8208;Epi&#8208;Isothiocyanato&#8208;Salinomycin and its Thiourea Derivatives as Potential Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C20&#8208;epi&#8208;isothiocyanate of salinomycin was designed and synthesized to serve as a versatile synthon that can react with various amines to assemble a library of 21 salinomycin thioureas. Compound 9&#8201;f showed dramatic antiproliferative activity in a selective five cancer cell lines, causing cellular late apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase.







Abstract
Salinomycin, a naturally occurring polyether ionophore antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus, has been demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity against a variety of cancer cell lines. In particular, it exhibits selective targeting of cancer stem cells. However, systemic toxicity, drug resistance and low bioavailability of the drug significantly limit its potential applications. In this study, the C20&#8208;epi&#8208;isothiocyanate of salinomycin was designed and synthesized, and then reacted with amines as a versatile synthon to assemble a series of salinomycin thiourea derivatives, which improved the druggability of salinomycin. The antiproliferative activities of the compounds were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against A549, HepG2, HeLa, 4T1, and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines using the CCK&#8208;8 assay. The pharmacological results showed that some salinomycin thiourea derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested tumor cells and high selectivity. Further mechanistic studies showed that compound 9&#8201;f, containing a 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzyl moiety, could directly induce apoptosis, probably by increasing caspase&#8208;9 protein expression and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase in a concentration dependent manner.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of a Halogenated Borazine: From Supramolecular Assemblies to a Random Covalent BN&#8208;Substituted Carbon Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions of a functionalized borazine, tetrabromoborazine, yield distinct BN&#8208;substituted carbon scaffolds, including an intricate kagom&#233; architecture and a random covalent network. This work, based on low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, provides insights into the surface chemistry of BN precursors.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface synthesis strategy has emerged as a promising route for fabricating well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BN&#8208;substituted carbon nanomaterials with tunable electronic properties. This approach relies on specially designed precursors and requires a thorough understanding of the on&#8208;surface reaction pathways. It promises precise structural control at the atomic scale, thus complementing chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this study, we investigated a novel heteroatomic precursor, tetrabromoborazine, which incorporates a BN core and an OH group, on Ag(111) using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT&#8208;STM/STS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through sequential temperature&#8208;induced reactions involving dehalogenation and dehydrogenation, distinct tetrabromoborazine derivatives were produced as reaction intermediates, leading to the formation of specific self&#8208;assemblies. Notably, the resulting intricate supramolecular structures include a chiral kagom&#233; lattice composed of molecular dimers exhibiting a unique electronic signature. The final product obtained was a random covalent carbon network with BN&#8208;substitution and embedded oxygen heteroatoms. Our study offers valuable insights into the significance of the structure and functionalization of BN precursors in temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions, which can help future rational precursor design. Additionally, it introduces complex surface architectures that offer a high areal density of borazine cores.

         <title>Formation to Transportation: En&#8208;Route Fission&#8208;Facilitated Formation of Spheres in a Phosphorus&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymer for Transportation of Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture and utilization of radioactive iodine using a single material is challenging. In this study, a C=C linked phosphine&#8208;containing porous organic polymer, PKPOP, is used for iodine transportation. The material efficiently captures gaseous iodine under ambient conditions and releases it in a controlled manner in both batch and flow conditions.







Abstract
Despite its potential as a clean power source to meet rising electricity demands, nuclear energy generates radioactive waste, including isotopes of iodine, that pose significant environmental and health risks. There is a growing demand to capture radioactive iodine and repurpose it effectively. However, achieving this dual functionality with a single material remains a significant challenge. This study explores phosphorus&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P&#8208;POPs) as probes for these dual functionalities. By employing 4&#8208;formyl(triphenyl)phosphine (BB1) and phenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetonitrile (BB2) under the Knoevenagel polycondensation method, P&#8208;POPs (PKPOPs) have been synthesized that exhibit a smooth spherical morphology, which efficiently capture and release iodine under ambient conditions, facilitating efficient transportation of molecular iodine. This novel approach aims to potentially transform nuclear waste into valuable organic feedstock via an iodination reaction. The innovative application of PKPOP has also been demonstrated for iodination reactions using ball mills and under continuous flow conditions, showcasing its potential for safer waste management and utilization.

The use of metal&#8208;free catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals is challenging. Here proposed a conjugated organic polymer (TpTf&#8208;1) with 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine as acceptor, triphenylamine as donor and vinylidene as linkage bond by molecular engineering. Its D&#8722;A structure promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and charges, and the vinylene bond further changes the charge distribution.







Abstract
The use of metal&#8208;free catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals is very challenging. Here, we synthesized a conjugated organic polymer (TpTf&#8208;1) featuring 2,4,6&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triazine as the acceptor unit, triphenylamine as the donor unit, and vinylidene bond as the linkage. The local structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) forms an intramolecular electric field that can promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and charges, meanwhile, the vinylidene bond can further change the charge distribution to promote exciton dissociation. Without the use of photosensitizers, the TpTf&#8208;1 exhibits outstanding selectivity of CO of up to 91.96&#8201;%, with a production rate of 45.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at visible light, which is 3.4&#8208;fold than TaTf&#8208;1 with the same D&#8722;A structure but linking in imine bond and is 2.8&#8208;fold than TpTf&#8208;2 linking in vinylidene bond but with a different donor unit. Moreover, TpTf&#8208;1 has a CO production rate of up to 117.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under full wavelength light irradiation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonization Synthesis of N, S Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials Derived from Agricultural Waste Peanut Shells for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
No wasting of waste: N, S co&#8208;doped carbon material (NPSC&#8208;4) was prepared by using agricultural waste peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using NPSC&#8208;4 not only has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, but also has good application value.







Abstract
Biomass carbon has the advantages of wide source, low cost and environmental protection, and has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this work, N and S co&#8208;doped carbon materials were prepared by using peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. When the peanut shell and activator were 2&#8197;g and 4&#8197;g, respectively, the prepared NSPC&#8208;4 had the largest specific surface area and special pore structure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No wasting of waste&lt;/b&gt;: N, S co-doped carbon material (NPSC-4) was prepared by using agricultural waste peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using NPSC-4 not only has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, but also has good application value.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomass carbon has the advantages of wide source, low cost and environmental protection, and has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this work, N and S co-doped carbon materials were prepared by using peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. When the peanut shell and activator were 2&#8197;g and 4&#8197;g, respectively, the prepared NSPC-4 had the largest specific surface area and special pore structure. Elemental analysis showed that the activator introduced more N, S and O atoms to the carbon material, and more heteroatoms helped to improve the surface structure of the carbon material and provide additional pseudocapacitance. In addition, NSPC-4 contains a short-range ordered graphite structure, which can provide excellent electrical conductivity. The electrochemical test results show that NSPC-4 has the largest specific capacitance. When the mass of the activator is higher than or below 4&#8197;g, the electrochemical performance of the carbon material will be reduced. The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by NSPC-4 has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; when the power density is 350&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The synthesis method is not only simple, green and economical, but also has important application value.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene is an easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission scaffold widely used for constructing fluorescent materials. In this study, we expanded its use to detect hypoxia and proteostasis imbalance in live cells. We introduced four amine&#8208;containing donors to create &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC). The maleimide&#8208;functionalized R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI detects unfolded proteins under stress, while the nitro&#8208;containing precursors R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 monitor hypoxia. These derivatives show high potential for biosensor applications.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene represents one of the easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) scaffolds. It has been widely adopted for the construction of fluorescent materials for broad applications. Here, we further expanded the utilization of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives for the detection of hypoxia or proteostasis imbalance in live cells. Four different amine containing donors were introduced to construct &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC) with donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds. Equipped with the cysteine (Cys) reactive group, maleimide (MI), R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI shows fluorescence turn&#8208;on property upon binding with unfolded proteins in&#8197;vitro and in live cells under proteostatic stress. By virtue of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, the level of unfolded protein loads in cells can be quantified by flow cytometry, or visualized under microscope. Furthermore, we also characterized the performance of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2, synthetic precursors of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, in cellular hypoxia. R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 revealed upregulated activities of nitroreductase, as well as increased hydrophobicity in live cells, under either chemical (NaN3) induced or atmospheric (1&#8201;% O2) hypoxia. Together, the advantages of easy modification and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of new &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives reported in this work highlight the great potential of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene in constructing functional biosensors and many other domains.

         <title>Conversion of Sugars to Lactic Acid using Homogeneous Niobium&#8208;Substituted Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>

This study uniquely investigates the use of various Keggin&#8208;type heteropoly salts (HPS) for the chemical conversion of sugars into lactic acid under mild conditions of 160&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar N2.







Abstract
The catalytic conversion of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals is an increasing field of research. This study uniquely investigates the use of various Keggin&#8208;type heteropoly salts (HPS) for the chemical conversion of sugars into lactic acid under mild conditions of 160&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar N2. In the first phase, Nb&#8211; and V&#8211;substituted HPSs were employed to synthesize lactic acid from dihydroxyacetone, an intermediate in the conversion of sugars to lactic acid. Results indicated that increasing the Nb content within the Keggin structure enhances the yield of lactic acid while reducing the formation of the byproduct acetaldehyde. A correlation was established between the redox activity of the HPS and the catalytic performance. The most active catalyst, Na5[PNb2Mo10O40], (NaNb2) achieved a lactic acid yield of 20.9&#8201;% after 1&#8197;h of reaction. In the second phase of the study, NaNb2 was applied for the conversion of different sugars including glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose, xylose, and cellobiose. It was demonstrated that the catalyst remains active for complex hexoses, achieving lactic acid yields of up to 12&#8201;%. Post&#8208;mortem analysis using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) confirmed the stability of NaNb2.

         <title>Sterically Hindered Derivatives of Pentacene and Octafluoropentacene</title>

Pentacene derivatives have been substituted with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties in 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions and electron withdrawing fluorine groups in the pro&#8208;cata positions. The stability of acene derivatives toward endoperoxide formation has been evaluated in solution under ambient light and trends determined based steric and electronic characteristics of the substituents.







Abstract
6,13&#8208;Diethynylpentacene derivatives with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties at the 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions have been synthesized, as well as derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine groups on the 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;positions. These molecules are designed to investigate relationships between steric and electronic effects on the stability of pentacene toward endoperoxide formation via reaction with photosensitized oxygen in solution under ambient light (i.&#8201;e., &#8216;laboratory&#8217; conditions). It is evident from the study that stabilization through changes to the electronic characteristics of pentacene are more effective than the incorporation of sterically bulky groups at the acetylenic termini. Selected pentacene derivatives have been made into binary, amorphous films with the fullerene derivative PCBM to investigate the stability imparted by substituents against cycloaddition reactions. Overall, the introduction of steric protection through the incorporation of Tr* groups is not an efficient strategy for enhancing the persistence of pentacenes. Stabilization through fluorination proves successful for extending the lifetime of the pentacene derivatives by an order of magnitude in solution. Notably, the persistence of pentacene derivatives in solution can also be enhanced through the use of ethereal solvents stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and/or an increased number of trialkylsilyl groups as substituents.

A catalyst&#8208;free solvent&#8208;controlled method for the divergent synthesis of spirocyclopropyl and spiropyrazoline oxindoles in high yields and with excellent diastereoselectivities from 3&#8208;ylideneoxindoles and ethyl diazoacetate is reported. Moreover, an oxidation protocol that allow the preparation of spiropyrazole oxindoles from spiropyrazoline oxindoles is also developed. The readily available substrates, simple operation and various product transformations further highlighted the utility of this method.

With ClCH2CH2Cl as the solvent, spirocyclopropyl oxindoles were obtained in moderate to excellent yields, whereas the use of MeOH as solvent afforded spiropyrazoline oxindoles in moderate to good yields. The readily available substrates, simple operation and various product transformations further highlighted the utility of this method.

&lt;p&gt;A catalyst-free solvent-controlled method for the divergent synthesis of spirocyclopropyl and spiropyrazoline oxindoles in high yields and with excellent diastereoselectivities from 3-ylideneoxindoles and ethyl diazoacetate is reported. Moreover, an oxidation protocol that allow the preparation of spiropyrazole oxindoles from spiropyrazoline oxindoles is also developed. The readily available substrates, simple operation and various product transformations further highlighted the utility of this method.

         <title>Spirocyclopropanes and Substituted Furans by Controlling Reactivity of 1,3&#8208;Enynoates: &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;Addition of Phosphines to Conjugate Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>
In the organophosphine chemistry, the typical reaction is initiated through the &#946;&#8208;addition of phosphine to allenoates or alkynoates. This paper reports an unprecedented reactivity of 1,3&#8208;enynoates and indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in the presence of phosphines. When indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione was used, &#947;&#8208;addition of phosphines to 1,3&#8208;enynoates was observed; this process resulted in the formation of spirocyclopropanes. However, when 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione was used, furans were produced through the &#948;&#8208;addition pathway.







Abstract
In the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction, a nucleophile undergoes &#946;&#8208;addition to activated alkenes or alkynes, forming reactive intermediates for subsequent carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;hetero bond formation. By using a &#960;&#8208;conjugated acceptor, however, an unprecedented reactivity of 1,3&#8208;enynoates and indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones was uncovered in the presence of phosphines. When indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were used, &#947;&#8208;addition of phosphines to 1,3&#8208;enynoates was observed for the first time; moderate to good yields were obtained for 14 substances containing the prominent spirocyclopropane scaffold with 100&#8201;% retention of (Z)&#8208;alkene. When 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were used, di(tri)&#8208;substituted furans were produced through the &#948;&#8208;addition pathway, with 20 substances and a yield of up to 88&#8201;% being achieved. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were conducted to obtain insights into the unconventional &#947;&#8208;addition reaction pathway.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Supramolecular Hosts Targeting Bacterial Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies on PE hosts reveal that a logP&#8776;3.75 is ideal to achieve high PE binding, good PE/PC selectivity and potent antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations&lt;10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The World Health Organization has described the antimicrobial resistance crisis as one of the top ten global public health threats. New antimicrobial agents that can fight infections caused by antimicrobial resistant pathogens are therefore needed. A potential strategy is the development of small molecules that can selectively interact with bacterial membranes (or membranes of other microbial pathogens), and thereby rapidly kill the bacteria. Here, we report the structure&#8208;activity relationship within a group of 22 compounds that were designed to bind the bacterial lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Liposome&#8208;based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP&#8776;3.75, which showed a 5x&#8211;7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10&#8197;&#956;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE&#8208;binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Carboxylic Acids with Easily Oxidizable Functional Groups Catalyzed by an Imidazole&#8208;Coordinated Fe3 Cluster under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new photo&#8208;catalyst system for decarboxylation of phenol and indole&#8208;containing carboxylic acids in the presence of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, leading to decarboxylative alkylation products by imidazole&#8208;coordinated Fe3 cluster under visible light irradiation. Various N&#8208;protected amino acids and heterocycle&#8208;containing aliphatic carboxylic acids were applicable in this catalytic transformation.







Abstract
Decarboxylative alkylation of carboxylic acids with easily oxidizable functional groups such as phenol and indole functionalities was achieved using a catalytic amount of basic iron(III) acetate, Fe(OAc)2(OH), in the presence of benzimidazole under 427&#8197;nm LED irradiation. Kinetic analyses of this catalytic reaction revealed that the reaction rate is first&#8208;order in alkenes and is linearly correlated with the light intensity; the faster reaction rate for the benzimidazole&#8208;ligated species was consistent with the increased absorbance in the visible light region. Wide functional group tolerance for the easily oxidizable groups is ascribed to the weak oxidation ability of the in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated oxo&#8208;bridged iron clusters compared with other iron(III) species.

         <title>Design of an Electrochemical Cell for Continuous Wave EPR Measurements of Radical Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of continuous wave EPR and electrochemistry is powerful for the characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many processes of biological or technological relevance. Here, we present a simple design for an electrochemical EPR cell that can be replicated easily, at low cost, and is compatible with any standard cwEPR instrumentation including benchtop spectrometers.







Abstract
The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw&#8208;EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in&#8208;situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light&#8208;induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup. Here we present a design for a low&#8208;cost electrochemical EPR cell that can be used in combination with any commercial cw&#8208;EPR instrumentation. The cell design is compared to existing setups and the performance of the cell is evaluated by comparison of EPR spectra obtained by chemical and electrochemical oxidation of a graphene fragment.

A nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene is designed and synthesized. The single&#8208;crystal structure proves its highly curved conformation at the nitrogen side. Due to the unique 3D structure and electron&#8208;donating property, it serves as an electron&#8208;donor to show intermolecular interaction with C60.







Abstract
A curved nanographene, conceptually by insertion of nitrogen into a trapezoidal planar nanographene at the edge was synthesized by &#960;&#8208;extension of the nitrogen&#8208;doped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. This N&#8208;doped nanographene exhibited a &#960;&#8208;electronic concave face containing a nonaromatic azepine ring in the middle with a size of 14.0&#8197;&#197; length and 4.0&#8197;&#197; depth, which represents an unprecedented half&#8208;side concave geometry of curved nanographene. The bent &#960;&#8208;extension exhibited a low degree of conjugation suggested by calculation results. Due to the unique 3D structure and electron&#8208;rich property, this nanographene showed pronounced intermolecular charge transfer with C60.

         <title>Anchoring Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Vacancies of MgO(Al) Nanosheets as Bifunctional Catalysts to Accelerate Hydrogenation&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a defect engineering strategy, a bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring Pt&#8208;O&#8722;Mg/Al moieties and Lewis basic sites was meticulously designed and constructed. This was achieved by anchoring platinum single&#8208;atom sites onto metal vacancies of MgO(Al) nanosheets, resulting in a 97.5&#8201;% yield and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8&#8197;h&#8722;1 during the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene under mild conditions.







Abstract
The direct hydrogenation of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene to 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole presents a significant challenge in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries. In this study, a defect engineering strategy is employed to create bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by anchoring Pt single atoms onto metal vacancies within MgO(Al) nanosheets. The resultant Pt1/MgO(Al) SAC displays an exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene, achieving a 97.5&#8201;% yield at complete conversion and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8&#8197;h&#8722;1 under the mild conditions. The synergistic catalysis between the fully exposed single&#8208;atom Pt sites within a unique Pt&#8208;O&#8722;Mg/Al moiety and the abundant basic sites of the MgO(Al) support is responsible for this outstanding catalytic performance. The current work, therefore, paves the way for developing bifunctional or multifunctional SACs that can enhance efficient organocatalytic conversions.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nonribosomal Peptides Chitinimides Reveal a Special Type of Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthetic investigation of the nonribosomal peptides chitinimides indicates the thioesterase domain ChmC&#8208;TE can recognize a small molecule methanol as well as a large X part for transesterification, completing the release of final products. This special type of TE domains harnesses a signature motif YNHNR for recognition of X part.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and their tailored enzymes have diverse biological functions. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis and function of chitinimides, which belong to the non&#8208;ribosomal peptide (NRP) subfamily featuring a pyrrolidine&#8208;containing part (X part) connected to the polypeptide chain via an ester bond. A conserved gene cassette, chmHIJK, is responsible for oxyacylation of the pyrrolidine moiety in the X part. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ChmC (ChmC&#8208;TE) catalyzes transesterification reactions with a free X part or methanol as a nucleophilic reagent to form different chitinimides. The crucial amino acid residues in the ChmC&#8208;TE domains responsible for the specific recognition of the X part were identified, and they were conserved in all the biosynthetic pathways of this NRP subfamily to form a signature motif, YNHNR, suggesting a special type of TE domain in NRPSs. Chitinimides demonstrate the biological function of promoting the swarming ability of the native producer. This study provides deep insights into the biosynthesis of this special NRP subfamily, and shows that the special TE domain could be used to generate diverse NRPs by combinatorial biosynthesis.

         <title>Comparative Study of PtM (M=Cu, Zn, Ga, Mn, Fe, In, Ce) Bimetals on Zincosilicate for Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilising zincosilicate support and a straightforward ion&#8208;exchange method, this study obtains a range of non&#8208;precious M monometallic catalysts and PtM bimetallic catalysts (M=Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). With an enhanced propane dehydrogenation capability, the improved catalyst PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 can be operated in a pure propane atmosphere at 550&#8201;&#176;C for at least 168&#8197;hours without significant deactivation.







Abstract
Silicoaluminate zeolites have relatively strong Br&#246;nsted (B) acid properties that can easily lead to deep cracking reactions, making them less favourable as carriers for propane dehydrogenation. Here, we utilise zincosilicate zeolite with less B&#8208;acid produced by the introduction of the heteroatom Zn into the framework as a carrier, followed by simultaneous ion exchange (IE) of M monometallic or PtM bimetallic (M=Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). The optimized PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 exhibits a superior propane dehydrogenation performance over PtCu/Zn&#8208;4 and PtGa/Zn&#8208;4, which can achieve a propane conversion of about 30&#8201;% in a pure propane atmosphere at 550&#8201;&#176;C and can be operated for at least 168&#8197;h without significant deactivation. Characterization techniques such as spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy with different gas adsorptions are used to investigate these PtM@zeolite catalysts in order to deepen the understanding of acid site identification, promoter effect and catalysis.

         <title>Dynamic Luminescence Vapochromism of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel luminescent organic salts with pyridinium&#8208;based cations were synthesized and characterized in detail. Their good thermal stability, outstanding photophysical properties, and dynamic vapochromic response to certain solvent vapors were demonstrated. In particular, (CzPy)Cl showed rapid luminescence vapochromism with a drastic shift in emission color, achieved by careful crystal engineering.







Abstract
Organic vapochromic materials which undergo a drastic change in their photophysical properties upon exposure to vapors or gases are attracting growing scientific attention because of their low price and wide range of possible applications. In this work, luminescence vapochromism of carbazole&#8208;pyridinium&#8208;based organic salts with a general structure of (CzPy)X (CzPy+=2,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridinium ion; X=Cl, Br or I) is reported. It was found that (CzPy)X compounds form J&#8208;aggregates, which rearranged back to monomeric form upon exposure to methanol, ethanol, acetone, and water vapors. In contrast, acetonitrile was found to promote the J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds by occupying the voids in their crystal lattice and pushing cations closer together. It was further demonstrated that the efficiency of J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds depends on the size of the anion, which was employed to realize dynamic luminescence vapochromism, with vapochromic response times ranging from a couple of minutes in (CzPy)Cl to more than an hour in (CzPy)I. In addition, (CzPy)X compounds exhibited high melting points of about 250&#8201;&#176;C and excellent thermal stability.

     alt="Dynamic Luminescence Vapochromism of Pyridinium-Based Organic Salts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three novel luminescent organic salts with pyridinium-based cations were synthesized and characterized in detail. Their good thermal stability, outstanding photophysical properties, and dynamic vapochromic response to certain solvent vapors were demonstrated. In particular, &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)Cl&lt;/b&gt; showed rapid luminescence vapochromism with a drastic shift in emission color, achieved by careful crystal engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic vapochromic materials which undergo a drastic change in their photophysical properties upon exposure to vapors or gases are attracting growing scientific attention because of their low price and wide range of possible applications. In this work, luminescence vapochromism of carbazole-pyridinium-based organic salts with a general structure of &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;CzPy&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;=2,3-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)pyridinium ion; &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;=Cl, Br or I) is reported. It was found that &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; compounds form J-aggregates, which rearranged back to monomeric form upon exposure to methanol, ethanol, acetone, and water vapors. In contrast, acetonitrile was found to promote the J-aggregation in &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; compounds by occupying the voids in their crystal lattice and pushing cations closer together. It was further demonstrated that the efficiency of J-aggregation in &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; compounds depends on the size of the anion, which was employed to realize dynamic luminescence vapochromism, with vapochromic response times ranging from a couple of minutes in &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)Cl&lt;/b&gt; to more than an hour in &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)I&lt;/b&gt;. In addition, &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; compounds exhibited high melting points of about 250&#8201;&#176;C and excellent thermal stability. &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)Cl&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;(CzPy)Br&lt;/b&gt; have also shown good photoluminescence quantum yields at room temperature in a solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Absorbing Photosensitizers Can Overcome Competing Light Absorption in Organic Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid the competing light absorption in organic photocatalysis, which typically occurs in the UV/vis region, herein we report a novel two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing photocatalyst dBAP&#8208;OMe that shows excellent photocatalytic performance under deep red light irradiation.







Abstract
Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short&#8208;wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co&#8208;catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2&#8722;Csp cross&#8208;coupling, and Csp2&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427&#8197;nm) and deep red (660&#8197;nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light&#8208;absorbing reactants, products, and/or co&#8208;catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal&#8208;free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os&#8208;based photosensitizers.

         <title>Synthesis and Spectroscopic Study of a Homogenous Bimetallic Os(II) Complex as a New Gastric Cancer Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis and characterization of a homogenous dinuclear Os(II) polypyridyl complex. The Os(II) complex exhibited a panchromatic UV&#8208;vis absorption, and can strongly generate 1O2 under LED light irradiation. It can also interact with fatty acids; and exhibited potent photocytotoxicity against HGC&#8208;27 human gastric cancer cells under irradiation, while was non&#8208;cytotoxic in the dark.







Abstract
A homogenous dinuclear Os(II) complex bisOs was synthesized and fully characterized. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry study, and density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electronic property. bisOs showed an obvious interaction with lipase and BSA, and can generate singlet oxygen under blue and red LED light irradiation, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) of 0.36 in comparison to that of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 in acetonitrile. bisOs exhibited moderate to great photocytotoxicity against HGC&#8208;27 human gastric cancer cells under blue LED light irradiation, giving the IC50 value as low as 1.83&#8197;&#956;M (PI value is 9.7), while was almost non&#8208;cytotoxic in the dark. The cellular singlet oxygen detection in HGC&#8208;27 cancer cells exhibited a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and cell uptake of bisOs in A549 cells was as high as 120&#8197;ng/106 cells, subcellular colocalization study indicated that bisOs was not accumulated in nucleus, and less likely to target mitochondria. This work provides a new example of dinuclear osmium complex as potential photosensitizer candidate for gastric treatment.

         <title>Toward Molecular Textiles: Synthesis and Characterization of Molecular Patches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of exploring and establishing a new fabrication method towards molecular textiles, molecular patches, which are smaller structural analogues, are investigated. The working principle of molecular patch formation, relies on a bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped covalent templated monomer, that via in&#8208;solution synthesis forms macrocyclic oligomers, which upon template cleavage result into linear fragments.







Abstract
This works describes a new step into the assembly of molecular textiles by the use of covalent templating. To establish a well&#8208;founded base and to tackle pre&#8208;mature obstacles, expected during the fabrication of the desired 2D&#8208;material, we opted to investigate the in&#8208;solution synthesis of molecular patches e.&#8201;g. cut&#8208;outs of a textile. A bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped monomer was designed, synthesized and was in&#8208;detail characterized by means of 1H&#8208;NMR and chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopy. In addition, x&#8208;ray structure crystallography was used to assess the absolute configuration. The monomer was used in an in&#8208;solution oligomerization to assemble the molecular patches via imine condensation, which revealed the formation of predominately dimeric patches. The imine&#8208;oligomer mixtures were further analyzed by reduction and cleaved to investigate the conditions required post mono&#8208;layer assembly. All reaction stages were followed by FT&#8208;IR and 1H&#8208;NMR analysis. Finally, we address the adsorption of the cross&#8208;shaped monomer onto a Au(111) surface, via high vacuum electrospray deposition. The subsequent annealing of the interface induced the on&#8208;surface imine condensation reaction, leading to unidimensional oligomers co&#8208;adsorbed with clusters of cyclic&#8208;dimers. Nc&#8208;AFM analysis revealed the tridimensional molecular structures, and together with electrospray deposition technique showed to be a promising pathway to investigate potential monomer candidates.

         <title>Axial Coordination Engineering on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Materials for Oxygen Reduction: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides theoretical insights into the oxygen reduction reaction process on the well&#8208;established FeN4 active center with different axial ligands and offers guidance for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by axial coordination engineering.







Abstract
Axial coordination engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to regulate the catalytic performance of metal&#8722;N&#8722;C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN4&#8722;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN4 center. Specially, FeN4&#8722;C6H5 is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant&#8208;potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH=1, FeN4&#8722;C6H5 possesses an impressive theoretical half&#8208;wave potential of ~1.01&#8197;V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts (~0.88&#8197;V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN4&#8722;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom catalysts.

Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; center. Specially, FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant-potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH=1, FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; possesses an impressive theoretical half-wave potential of ~1.01&#8197;V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts (~0.88&#8197;V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single-metal-atom catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using the formate salt as the reductant is developed. A range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into value&#8208;added anilines under blue light irradiation. Mechanistic studies revealed that arene thiol radicals and CO2&#8901;&#8722; are key intermediates for the transformation. The protocol represents a transition metal free and green example for the realization of such transformations.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using formate salts as the reductant was developed. A wide range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into aniline products in a transition metal free fashion. Mechanistic studies revealed that radical species (carbon dioxide radical anion and thiol radical) are key intermediates for the transformation. We anticipate that this method will provide a valuable and green strategy for the reduction of nitrobenzenes.

         <title>Proton Conduction via Water and Ammonia Coordinated Metal Cationic Species in MOF and MHOF Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically robust proton&#8208;conducting materials, In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF and MHOF&#8208;4, having different solvent&#8208;coordinated metal cationic species (H2O and NH3) were rationally designed and synthesized to demonstrate their proton conduction achieved through coordinated polar protic solvents molecules.







Abstract
Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metalo hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) are designed as promising solid&#8208;state proton conductors by incorporating various protonic species intrinsically or extrinsically, design and development of such materials by employing the concept of proton conduction through coordinated polar protic solvent is largely unexplored. Herein, we have constructed two proton&#8208;conducting materials having different solvent coordinated metal cationic species: In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, ({[In(H2O)6][In3(Pzdc)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;15H2O}n; H2Pzdc: pyrazine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid) with coordinated water molecules from hexaaquaindium cationic species, and MHOF&#8208;4, ([{Co(NH3)6}2(2,6&#8208;NDS)2(H2O)2]n; 2,6&#8208;H2NDS: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid) with coordinated ammonia from hexaammoniacobalt cationic species. Interestingly, higher proton conductivity was achieved for In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF (1.5&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than MHOF&#8208;4 (6.3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) under the extreme conditions (80&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% RH), which could be attributed to enhanced acidity of coordinated water molecules having much lower pKa value than that of coordinated ammonia. Greater charge polarization on hydrogen atoms of In3+&#8208;coordinated water molecules than that of Co2+&#8208;coordinated ammonia led to the high conductivity of In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, as evident by quantum chemical studies. Such a comparative study on metal&#8208;coordinated protic polar solvents in achieving proton conduction in crystalline solids is yet to be made.

         <title>Highly Twisted Fenestrindane&#8208;Based Porous Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly distorted, porous nanographenes constructed around a fenestrindane core were synthesized by a fourfold intramolecular Yamamoto macrocyclization (R=O&#8208;n&#8208;hexyl or tert&#8208;butyl). Their UV absorption and anion binding properties were distinctively different from the structurally similar porous nanographene bearing a tribenzotriquinacene core. The disparity of properties is attributed to the unique, S4&#8208;symmetric saddle conformation of the title compounds, which strongly differs from the bowl&#8208;shaped structure of the TBTQ analog.







Abstract
Two fenestrindane&#8208;based porous nanographenes containing four polyaromatic macrocycles in a highly twisted, basically S4&#8211;symmetric conformation were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Stepwise &#960;&#8208;extension at the periphery of the fenestrindane core by a sequence of eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, fourfold Scholl cyclodehydrogenation and another eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction affords the porous nanographene precursors in good yields. In the last step, fourfold intramolecular Yamamoto coupling generates the porous nanographenes in 17&#8208;18&#8201;%&#8208;yield. Their optical and electronic properties were studied by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. DFT calculations revealed structural details of the macrocycles. The surprisingly weak binding of these porous structures with chloride ions (K&#8776;10&#8197;M&#8722;1) is attributed to their highly twisted conformation. The title compounds represent the first porous nanographenes based on the [5.5.5.5]fenestrane motif and, at the same time, they consist of a fenestrane&#8208;like polyarylene network.

A method for the synthesis of tertiary alcohols was developed based on the formal umpolung addition of aryl ketones with electrophiles utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from aryl ketones, with electrophiles afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols.

The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from alkyl aryl&#8208; and diaryl ketones, with electrophiles such as phenyl vinyl sulfone, afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols.

This operationally simple protocol provides efficient complementary access to tertiary alcohols that are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Assisted Photochemical Conversion of O&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Protected Hydroxamates to Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photochemical protocol for the conversion of O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl hydroxamates to primary or secondary amides was developed. The N&#8722;O bond cleavage was achieved under LED irradiation at 370&#8197;nm in the presence of an amine, suggesting the generation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex, as confirmed by supplementary DFT and UV&#8208;Vis studies.







Abstract
The hydroxamic acid functionality is present in various medicinal agents and has attracted special interest for synthetic transformations in both organic and medicinal chemistry. The N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxamic acid derivatives provides an interesting transformation for the generation of various products. We demonstrate, herein, that O&#8208;benzyl&#8208;type protected hydroxamic acids may undergo photochemical N&#8722;O bond cleavage, in the presence or absence of a catalyst, leading to amides. Although some O&#8208;benzyl protected aromatic hydroxamates may be photochemically converted to amides in the presence of a base and anthracene as the catalyst, employing O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group allowed the smooth conversion of both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxamates to primary or secondary amides in good to excellent yields in the presence of an amine, bypassing the need of a catalyst. DFT and UV&#8208;Vis studies supported the effective generation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex between O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl hydroxamates and amines, which enabled the successful product formation under these photochemical conditions. An extensive substrate scope was demonstrated, showcasing that both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxamates are compatible with this protocol, affording a wide variety of primary and secondary amides.

         <title>Dynamic Phase Behavior of Surface&#8208;Active Fluorinated Ionic Liquid Epoxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquids (FSAILs) containing catalytically active anions are highly efficient epoxidation catalysts. Tungstate&#8208;FSAILs serve as exceptionally potent epoxidations catalysts and enable control over the phase behavior in the highly efficient biphasic epoxidation of olefins with H2O2 under mild conditions. Additionally, catalyst recycling is demonstrated over ten subsequent runs without loss in activity or selectivity.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of amphiphobic fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquid (FSAIL) epoxidation catalysts, which show reversible temperature&#8208;controlled solubility in water. The solubility of FSAILs containing the catalytically active perrhenate&#8208; and tungstate anions was studied in both the aqueous and the substrate phase, showing a significant solubility decrease in both media compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated congeners. It was shown that both the epoxide product and the catalyst additive phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) are efficient in transferring the FSAIL catalyst into the organic phase, rendering the reaction homogeneous. The FSAILs were used as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, showing an exceptionally high catalytic activity at mild conditions. Catalyst recycling was demonstrated over ten consecutive runs by phase separation and subsequent product distillation.

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo(chloro)silanes are indispensable building blocks in silicon chemistry. Yet, aside from the M&#252;ller&#8208;Rochow process for commodity chemicals, the synthesis of more sophisticated building blocks often takes considerable effort. We disclose efficient access routes to organo(chloro)silanes, &#8208;silyl ethers, and &#8208;siloxanes with vicinal Si centers, which are promising precursors for ditopic Lewis acids and hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic polymers.







Abstract
Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8722;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8722;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8722;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.

         <title>A Strongly Ambiphilic Ferrocene&#8208;Based Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8211; Specific Decomposition to an Enamine by a 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Shift</title>

The strongly ambiphilic [3]ferrocenophane&#8208;type CAAC fc(CPh2&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1; fc=1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene) undergoes a 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;). Efficient trapping of 1 is possible with, inter alia, carbon monoxide and elemental selenium, affording the stable aminoketene 1=C=O and the selenoamide 1=Se, respectively.







Abstract
The recently described crystalline cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene with a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene (fc) backbone fc(CPh2&#8722;C&#8722;NMes) (A, Mes=mesityl) is highly reactive due to its particularly pronounced ambiphilicity and is thermally not stable in solution due to an intramolecular insertion of the divalent carbon atom into a methyl C&#8722;H bond of the Mes substituent. The closely related congener fc(CPh2&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1) cannot undergo such an insertion reaction. Nevertheless, 1 is too short&#8208;lived for isolation due to a rapid 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the isomeric cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8722;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;) in a specific decomposition process unprecedented for CAACs. Trapping of 1 was possible with carbon monoxide, elemental selenium and with [CuBr(SMe2)], respectively affording the aminoketene 1=C=O, the selenoamide 1=Se and the homoleptic CuI complex [Cu(1)2][CuBr2]. 1 is an even stronger ambiphile than A according to NMR spectroscopic data. Similar to A, 1 does not react with H2, because the experimentally observed intramolecular process is kinetically more favourable according to DFT results.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward asymmetric transfer hydrogenation for accessing enantioenriched secondary benzyl alcohols involving free phenolic hydroxyl group(s) under mild conditions was developed. The synthetic potential of this method was also demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further conversion into epinephrine analogues.







Abstract
A straightforward asymmetric transfer hydrogenation for accessing enantiomerically enriched secondary benzyl alcohols involving free phenolic hydroxyl group(s) under mild conditions was developed. Various of optical pure aryl alcohols with a remarkable functional group compatibility were achieved with 78&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;% yields, 84&#8201;%&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% ee's and up to 10 000 TON. This rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction could be performed in a gram&#8208;scale without loss of the efficiency. Furthermore, the synthetic utility has also been demonstrated in the asymmetric synthesis of (S)&#8208;adrenaline and (S)&#8208;phenylephrine.

         <title>Electrooxidative Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Arylacetic Acids Towards the Synthesis of Carbonyls under Air Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation of arylacetic acids has been well established to synthesize carbonyls under mild conditions, whose application and practicality was highlighted by the conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs and scale&#8208;up transformation. The protocol featured cheap materials, good functional group tolerance, simple constant current protocol and eco&#8208;friendly reaction conditions.







Abstract
After systematic realization of decarboxylative functionalization of carboxylic acids under heating conditions in our group, we herein reported an electrochemical method for Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation of arylacetic acids under open air conditions. The protocol provided corresponding carbonyls including aldehydes and ketones in moderate to satisfactory yields with good functional group tolerance, furthermore, the practicability and advantage of the method was highlighted through Ni&#8208;catalyzed oxidative decarboxylation of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs and preformation of scalable transformation. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the possible involvement of free radical intermediate in the conversion.

         <title>A Cycloparaphenylene Acetylene as Potential Precursor for an Armchair Carbon Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of a naphthalene&#8208;decorated [12]cycloparaphenylene acetylene. Subsequent benzannulation reactions on the acetylenes allow formation of an extended macrocycle that potentially serves as a precursor for the synthesis of a defined armchair carbon nanotube. Attempts to fuse the compound to the carbon nanotube using Roland Heinrich Scholl's chemistry was so far unsuccessful.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a long&#8208;standing goal in synthetic chemistry. Producing CNTs with defined lengths and diameters would render these materials and thus their fascinating properties accessible in a controlled way. Inspired by a recently reported synthesis of armchair graphene sheets that relied on a benzannulation and Scholl oxidation of a poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene), the same strategy is applied on a cyclic substrate with a short, but well defined CNT as target structure. Herein we report the synthesis of a derivatized [12]cycloparaphenylene acetylene ([12]CPPA) that was accessible employing a Sonogashira macrocyclization. The obtained macrocycle is the largest [n]CPPA reported to date and displays bright turquoise fluorescence with a large quantum yield of 77&#8201;%. The [12]CPPA can be transformed by a 12&#8208;fold benzannulation that converts each alkyne to a naphthalene and therefore allows formation of an armchair [12,12]CNT precursor. The final 72&#8208;fold Scholl oxidation to the [12,12]CNT turned out to be challenging and its optimization requires an improved synthetic strategy to produce large quantities of the final precursor. The developed approach poses a potential break through strategy for the production of CNTs and certainly incentivizes synthetic chemists to apply the same methodology for various conjugated macrocycles.

Hybrid solid supports have been obtained via a two&#8208;step process consisting of a silanization and a subsequent functionalization of Controlled Pore Glass with selected multi&#8208;amine compounds. In particular, 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG functionalized with 8&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol) with each arm amine&#8208;terminated applied for 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG allowed high loading capacity and effective automated syntheses of long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotide units) oligonucleotides.







Abstract
Controlled pore glass (CPG), differing in pore size and subsequent specific surface, was chemically modified by: (1)&#8197;increasing surface susceptibility for amine functionalization via reaction with oxirane&#8208;type (active) and alkyl/aryl&#8208;type (inactive towards amine compounds) silane pro&#8208;adhesive compounds, and (2)&#8197;immobilization of trimethylolpropane tris[poly(propylene glycol), amine terminated] ether, comb&#8208;like 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine] with each branch amine terminated, and a poly(propylene imine) amine&#8208;terminated second&#8208;generation dendrimer. The increase in surface density of amine functions &#8211; monitored by UV&#8208;Vis technique adopted for quantitative measurements of Ruhemann's purple intensity &#8211; improved final loading capacity, characterized by dimethoxytrityl cation absorption. Obtained materials proved their applicability in automatic oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis, especially when silanized 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG modified with 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine], with deduced empirical formula CPG &#8211; silane &#8211; (NH)6.4PEG&#8208;(NH2)1.6, was used for long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotides) ONs synthesis. This can be regarded as a good CPG support for this purpose. Moreover, hybrid supports with different porosity allowed the synthesis of shorter ONs with satisfactory yield and purity, monitored by RP&#8208;HPLC and MALDI&#8208;TOF. On the molecular level, two competitive mechanisms seem to influence the utility of the final hybrid support: spatial availability of active sites and the propensity of the functionalizer to bond with the CPG surface.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Aryl Carbamates Using Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium(I) complex bearing a chelating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand catalyzes hydrogen isotope exchange directed by the bulky tert&#8208;butyl carbamate group. A range of aniline derivatives are labelled with high deuterium incorporation, and the method is extended to O&#8208;aryl carbamates. Computational and experimental mechanistic studies reveal distinct differences in the catalytic cycle compared to the corresponding monodentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/phosphine catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) via C&#8722;H activation constitutes an efficient method for the synthesis of isotopically&#8208;enriched compounds, which are crucial components of the drug discovery process and are extensively employed in mechanistic studies. A series of iridium(I) complexes, bearing a chelating phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, was designed and synthesized for application in the catalytic HIE of challenging N&#8208; and O&#8208;aryl carbamates. A broad range of substrates were labeled efficiently, and applicability to biologically&#8208;relevant systems was demonstrated by labeling an &#671;&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;derived carbamate with excellent levels of deuterium incorporation. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveiled intriguing mechanistic features within this process, in comparison to C&#8722;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange catalyzed by monodentate Ir(I) NHC/phosphine complexes.

         <title>Stable Antiaromatic [16]Triphyrin(2.1.1) with Core Modification: Synthesis Using a 16&#960; Electrocyclic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable antiaromatic trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) was synthesized and characterized using a core modification strategy. The synthesis involves a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The nearly planar structure and small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap of trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) were consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) exhibited antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching.







Abstract
Antiaromatic porphyrinoids have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and potential applications. However, synthesis of antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoids is challenging owing to the inherent instability associated with smaller ring sizes. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of the first stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid. We utilized a core modification approach to stabilize the [16]triphyrin(2.1.1). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a nearly planar structure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated reversible oxidation behavior and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which was consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Chemical oxidation yielded an aromatic [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) dication, highlighting the antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability of this system. This synthesis involved the discovery of a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which underwent oxidative dehydrogenation to yield the target compound. Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high&#8208;order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.

         <title>An Imine&#8208;Functionalized Silicone&#8208;Based Epoxy Coating with Stable Adhesion and Controllable Degradation for Enhanced Marine Antifouling and Anticorrosion Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imine&#8208;functionalized silicone&#8208;based epoxy coating with steady adhesion for enhanced marine antifouling and anticorrosion properties is prepared. The coating exhibits satisfactory comprehensive properties, and its controlled degradation can be achieved in aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, which can refrain from incineration or landfilling after failure. The multifunctional coating conforms to the principle of green and sustainable development.







Abstract
Biofouling and corrosion of submerged equipment caused by marine organisms severely restrict the rapid development of the marine industry. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine&#8208;functionalized command&#8208;degradable bio&#8208;based epoxy coating (SAHPEP&#8208;DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3&#8208;bis (3&#8208;aminopropyl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51&#8208;DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP&#8208;DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of &#8211;C=N&#8208; and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si chain segments in the cross&#8208;linking network. The coating achieves resistance rates of 99.59&#8201;% and 99.20&#8201;% against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, and shows promising resistance against algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater (with |Z|0.01&#8197;Hz and arc radius of about 1011&#8197;&#937; and exceeding 1010&#8197;&#937; respectively). The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments. Moreover, its controlled degradation after coating failure can be achieved in acid aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, facilitated by the presence of &#8211;C=N&#8208;. This work presents a novel degradable coating successfully coupled the dual functions of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings, avoiding the employment of intermediate coat, indicating vast potential for application in various marine engineering fields.

         <title>An Electrosynthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles from N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indirect electrochemical oxidative cyclisation of N&#8208;acyl hydrazones offers an efficient approach to access 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles, an important motif in medicinal chemistry. The DABCO&#8208;mediated reaction enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of these valuable heterocycles from readily available aldehydes and hydrazides.







Abstract
The 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole is a widely encountered motif in the areas of pharmaceuticals, materials, and agrochemicals. This work has established a mediated electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones. Using DABCO as the optimal redox mediator has enabled a mild oxidative cyclisation, without recourse to stoichiometric oxidants. In contrast to previous methods, this indirect electrochemical oxidation has enabled a broad range of substrates to be accessed, with yields of up to 83&#8201;%, and on gram scale. The simplicity of the method has been further demonstrated by the development of a one&#8208;pot procedure, directly transforming readily available aldehydes and hydrazides into valuable heterocycles.

The synthesis of a collection of phenyl&#8208; and hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;fused porphyrin conjugates is presented. The architectures&#8217; intriguing absorption properties were investigated, revealing the influence of the number of porphyrins, the degree of &#960;&#8208;extension, and their relative position in the molecule.







Abstract
A library of novel &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) architectures is presented. Two distinct synthetic pathways were utilized to obtain either phenyl&#8208; or HBC&#8208;fused compounds. Absorption experiments reveal the species&#8217; exciting photophysical and optoelectronic properties. Depending on the degree of &#960;&#8208;extension, the number of porphyrins, and their relative position, a decisive change in shape, panchromatic broadening, and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption curves is observed. Theoretical studies give more profound insight into the molecule's electronic structures, showing vast decreases in HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Squaramide&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Hosts for Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating two squaramide motifs into the axle component of [2]rotaxanes dramatically enhances their anion binding affinities and selectivity properties compared to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxane, revealing a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion binding trend in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media. Varying the rigidity of the linker connecting the axle squaramides results in the rotaxanes displaying strong and selective binding of tetrahedral and trigonal oxoanions.







Abstract
The first examples of bis&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked via rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media are examined through extensive 1H&#8208;NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis&#8208;squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous&#8208;organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis&#8208;squaramide [2]rotaxane.

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity in Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Aniline&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations into the reactions between Ru(II) and N,N&#8208;disubstituted aniline&#8208;functionalized alkynes revealed that reaction temperature, substrates, and solvent polarity can manipulate the chemoselectivity of cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylanilines for C2&#8208; or C3&#8208;metalated indoles.







Abstract
The cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes induced by d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers has traditionally been associated with the vinylidene pathway. However, recent evidence suggests that d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers can also activate alkynes through non&#8208;vinylidene pathways. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation into the reactions between the Ru(II) complex [Ru([9]aneS3)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ and 2&#8208;alkynylanilines. Our study revealed that the selectivity between the vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways can be tuned by reaction temperature, substrate, and solvent polarity. This strategic control allows for the preferential formation of either C2&#8208; or C3&#8208;metalated indole zwitterion complexes. Additionally, we identified a rare decyclization mechanism that enables the conversion of C2&#8208;metalated indoles to C3&#8208;metalated indoles, underscoring the significance of product stability in these pathways. Overall, this work demonstrates practical approaches to control the preference between vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways, which is crucial for the design of new catalysts and metalated heterocyclic complexes.

         <title>Redox Activity of Co Species in the Active Sites of CoNx/CoOx Facilitates Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst Co/CoOx&#8208;NCNFs&#8208;0.1, characterized by abundant active species, large specific surface area, and considerable oxygen vacancy, was prepared through the combination of electrospinning process and annealing. Its catalytic mechanism involving the redox of Co (II and III) is proposed. The assembled ZABs exhibit high specific capacity (771&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), larger power density (981.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (325&#8197;h).







Abstract
Developing efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the performance of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). In this study, cobalt/cobalt oxides embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoOx/NCNFs) were synthesized through a combination of electrospinning and annealing processes. The resulting Co/CoOx/NCNFs catalysts feature abundant CoNx and CoOx active species, leveraging the large specific surface area of nanofibers to facilitate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized Co/CoOx/NCNFs&#8208;0.1 achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (vs. RHE) of 0.82&#8197;V and required only 429&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a typical three&#8208;electrode system with 0.1&#8197;M KOH using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a pine instruments rotator, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2. The assembled ZABs exhibited high specific capacity (771&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), substantial power density (981.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;325&#8197;h). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the electrocatalytic processes involve the redox activity of Co (II and III) species derived from abundant CoNx and CoOx, elaborating the origin of the catalysts&#8217; exceptional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. This work not only presents a straightforward and effective approach for producing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs but also sheds light on the catalytic mechanisms underlying ORR and OER for CoNx/CoOx&#8208;based oxygen electrocatalysts.

The Front Cover shows trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid that has been synthesized and characterized. The synthesis involves the oxidation of dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which was formed in a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction of a linear&#8208;conjugated intermediate. The final product exhibits a nearly planar structure, a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;i. Yamashita and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403097).

In the Cover Feature, three green&#8208;glowing nickel&#8208;porphyrins surround a central red&#8208;glowing hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC). The aromatic fragments have tesla coils attached to their periphery through which they interact with each other, highlighted by electrical discharges. The tesla coils in the porphyrins emphasize the &#946;&#8208;meso five&#8208;ring fusion motif in the HBC&#8211;porphyrin conjugates presented in the paper, where up to three porphyrins are coupled to a single hexabenzocoronene. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Meyer, N. Jux and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403250). The cover art was designed and made by Christoph Oleszak.

The Cover Feature depicts various aspects of electron microscopy methods and membrane separation. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) show great potential for separation processes because of their tunability and enhanced performance. The Review by D. Poloneeva and J. Gascon (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403201) describes the methods, challenges, and applications of focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for MMM characterization. A range of examples where electron microscopy was used for the accurate investigation of filler dispersion are provided.

         <dc:description>
The competition between vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways in the ruthenium&#8208;induced cyclization of aniline&#8208;functionalized alkynes can be strategically controlled through the tuning of experimental conditions, much like manipulating a battle between arcade characters by using joysticks. This ability to control the selectivity of the reaction is supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8208;Y. Wong and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402959).

The review summarizes the current research progresses of surface&#8208;synthesized magnetic carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. We mainly review the on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterization techniques, as well as the magnetism of nanographene and nanographene&#8208;based spin chains. Finally, we look forward to the improvement of experimental methods and the potential for future applications.







Abstract
The emergence of &#960;&#8208;magnetism in low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, such as nanographenes (NGs), has captured significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics and quantum technologies. Recent advancements in on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions have enabled the atomically precise engineering of these nanostructures, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by their inherent strong chemical reactivity. This review highlights the essential concepts and synthesis methods used in studying NGs. It also outlines the remarkable progress made in understanding and controlling their magnetic properties. Advanced characterization techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), have been instrumental in visualizing and manipulating these nanostructures, which highlighting their critical role in the field. The review underscores the versatility of carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;magnetic materials and their potential for integration into next&#8208;generation electronic devices. It also outlines future research directions aimed at optimizing their synthesis and exploring applications in cutting&#8208;edge technologies.

         <title>Recent Progress in Situ Application of H2O2 Produced via Catalytic Synthesis</title>

In situ utilization of catalytically synthesized H2O2 in the field of organic synthesis such as amidoximation of ketones, alcohols oxidation, C&#8722;H oxidation, olefin epoxidation.







Abstract
Industrial production of H2O2 requires lots of energy and causes environmental pollution. Moreover, in subsequent applications, much economic loss could be produced during the transportation process of H2O2 and its dilution process. Therefore, it is highly desirable for in&#8197;situ application of H2O2. In recent years, catalytic synthesis of H2O2, e.&#8201;g., direct catalytic synthesis, electrocatalytic synthesis, and photocatalytic synthesis, has attracted more and more attention because the continuous and low&#8208;concentration H2O2 produced by catalytic synthesis can be directly used for the oxidation of organic compounds, effectively avoiding the shortcomings of the current industrial route. Here, we briefly reviewed the latest processes for the catalytic production of H2O2 via various routes. On this basis, we summarized and discussed the in&#8197;situ application of H2O2 in typical organic conversion reactions, including the ammoximation of ketones, the oxidation of alcohols, the oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds, and the oxidation of olefins. Some in&#8197;situ coupling reactions have shown excellent performance with high conversion and selectivity, and the economic cost has been significantly reduced. Finally, the shortcomings of the in&#8197;situ utilization of H2O2 in coupling reactions were analyzed, and some strategies for promoting the efficiency of the H2O2 application in organic synthesis were proposed.

         <title>Naturally Occurring [4+2] Type Terpenoid Dimers Assembled through Unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 69, December 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines an overview of the progress in naturally occurring [4+2] dimeric terpenoids, focusing on their unique assembly via unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand cycloaddition reactions. This review presents their sources, bioactivities, proposed biosynthetic mechanisms, and chemical syntheses. We have compared the [4+2] dimerization processes in biogenetic hypotheses with their chemical synthesis, hoping to establish a correlation between biological and chemical synthesis for representative [4+2] natural dimers.







Abstract
Terpenoid dimers of the [4+2] type, which are naturally occurring compounds biosynthetically derived from the [4+2] cycloaddition of two precursors, have garnered considerable attention due to their complex molecular structures, diverse biological activities, and intriguing biosynthetic pathways. We have previously summarized the advancements in three types of [4+2] terpenoid dimers. In this review, we will focus on the lesser&#8208;explored class of [4+2] terpenoid dimers which assembled from two electron&#8208;deficient precursors via the unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (UMEDDA). We will summarize their sources, biological activities, proposed biosynthesis, and chemical syntheses. Finally, a summary and outlook for this fascinating class of compounds will be presented.

This review covers the methodologies, challenges, and applications of characterizing MMMs using Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It highlights the principles, challenges, and future directions in using these techniques to optimize MMMs for various applications.







Abstract
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as promising materials for various separation processes due to their tunable properties, enhanced separation performance and reproducibility. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and applications associated with the characterization of MMMs using two advanced imaging techniques: Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We begin by outlining the principles and capabilities of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, emphasizing their suitability for studying the microstructure, morphology, and composition of MMMs at nanoscale resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the specific challenges and limitations encountered in the characterization of MMMs using these techniques, including sample preparation, image acquisition, and data interpretation. Furthermore, we review the diverse applications of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM in elucidating the structure&#8208;property relationships of MMMs. Through illustrative examples, we highlight the valuable insights gained from these imaging techniques in optimizing MMMs for various separation applications. Finally, we propose future directions and emerging trends in MMM characterization, including the integration of lasers into FIB&#8208;SEM and in&#8197;situ characterization techniques, to address current challenges and push the boundaries of MMM design and performance. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for characterizing MMMs using FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, identifies key challenges, and offers insights into future research directions aimed at harnessing the full potential of MMMs for sustainable separation technologies.

         <title>Nitride Zeolites from Ammonothermal Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal synthesis of oxide zeolites is a commonly used procedure. As exchanging oxide ions by nitride ions is very promising for interesting material properties, we present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of some nitride zeolites using supercritical ammonia. The employed mineralizers have a major influence on the reaction outcome which can be utilized to control the formation of phase&#8208;pure products.







Abstract
Oxide zeolites are synthesized from aqueous solutions in an established way employing hydrothermal synthesis. Transferring this approach to nitride zeolites requires a solvent providing nitrogen for which ammonia has proven to be particularly suitable. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the (oxo)nitridosilicate compounds Ce3[Si6N11], Li2RE4[Si4N8]O3 (RE=La, Ce) and K1.25Ce7.75[Si11N21O2]O0.75. Within this procedure, the usage of supercritical ammonia as a solvent as well as the utilization of the mineralizers NaN3, Li3N and KN3, respectively, allowed the targeted synthesis of large single crystals. Formation of these (oxo)nitridosilicates depends mainly on the employed mineralizer despite their similar degree of condensation. The three compounds were structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction and their crystal structures contain a wide range of different ring sizes within their tetrahedra networks.

     alt="Nitride Zeolites from Ammonothermal Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrothermal synthesis of oxide zeolites is a commonly used procedure. As exchanging oxide ions by nitride ions is very promising for interesting material properties, we present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of some nitride zeolites using supercritical ammonia. The employed mineralizers have a major influence on the reaction outcome which can be utilized to control the formation of phase-pure products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxide zeolites are synthesized from aqueous solutions in an established way employing hydrothermal synthesis. Transferring this approach to nitride zeolites requires a solvent providing nitrogen for which ammonia has proven to be particularly suitable. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the (oxo)nitridosilicate compounds Ce&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;], Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;=La, Ce) and K&lt;sub&gt;1.25&lt;/sub&gt;Ce&lt;sub&gt;7.75&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;. Within this procedure, the usage of supercritical ammonia as a solvent as well as the utilization of the mineralizers NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N and KN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, allowed the targeted synthesis of large single crystals. Formation of these (oxo)nitridosilicates depends mainly on the employed mineralizer despite their similar degree of condensation. The three compounds were structurally characterized using X-ray diffraction and their crystal structures contain a wide range of different ring sizes within their tetrahedra networks. The zeolite(-like) crystal structures are elucidated and compared to known nitridosilicate representatives of the respective structure types. Their elemental composition was investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and incorporation of the O rather than N&#8722;H functionality was confirmed by Fourier-Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as by charge distribution (CHARDI) and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations. The presented examples demonstrate that ammonothermal synthesis provides a one-step access from elemental starting materials towards nitride zeolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism and Enhancing Selectivity of a RuII&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin Complex with RAFT&#8208;Generated Glycopolymer Exploiting Warburg Effect in Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ruthenium bis&#8208;bipyridyl complex of Morphocumin, a known photoactive lysosome targeting curcumin derivative has been encapsulated with glucose functionalized polymeric nanoparticle to exploit the Warburg effect in cancer. This nanomolar potent metal&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agent can achieve selectivity in pancreatic tumors upon encapsulation. In presence of excess H2O2 it can release Morphocumin in the tumor vicinity.







Abstract
The Warburg effect, which generates increased demand of glucose in cancer cells is a relatively underexplored phenomenon in existing commercial drugs to enhance uptake in cancer cells. Here, we present a chemotherapeutic strategy employing a Ru(II)&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin complex (2) encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembling glucose&#8208;functionalized copolymer P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) (where G=glucose; MMA=methyl methacrylate; EMA=ethyl methacrylate), designed to exploit this effect for enhanced selectivity in cancer treatment. The P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) polymer, synthesized via reversible&#8208;addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, has a number average molecular weight (Mn,NMR) of 8000&#8197;g/mol. Complex 2, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome&#8208;targeting compound, morphocumin, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Additionally, complex 2 promotes ROS accumulation, which may further enhance morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparative studies reveal that 2 outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (1) analog in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both 1 and 2 exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low&#8208;intensity visible light, but their chemotoxicity significantly increases with incubation time in the dark, highlighting the superior chemotherapeutic efficacy of the O,O&#8208;coordinating Ru(II) ternary polypyridyl complexes. Complex 2 induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway and shows a 9&#8208;fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa&#8208;2) over non&#8208;cancerous HEK293 cells when encapsulated in the glucose&#8208;conjugated polymer (DP@2). Glucose deprivation in the culture medium further enhances drug efficacy by an additional 5&#8208;fold. This work underscores the potential of glucose&#8208;functionalized polymers and ROS&#8208;responsive Ru(II) complexes in targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Partially Sulfated Pillar[5]Arenes: Synthesis and Molecular Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pillar[5]arene sulfates P5Sn with different numbers of sulfate ionic groups are synthesized and fully characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational methods. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the binding affinity of P5Sn toward cationic guests increases dramatically as N increases.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of sulfated pillar[5]arene hosts (P5S2&#8208;P5S10) that differ in the number of sulfate substituents. All five P5Sn hosts display high solubility in water (73&#8211;131&#8197;mM) and do not undergo significant self&#8208;association according to 1H NMR dilution experiments. The x&#8208;ray crystal structures of P5S6, P5S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA, P5S8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA, and P5S10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA reveal one intracavity molecule of Me6HDA and several external molecules of Me6HDA which form a network of close methonium&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;sulfate interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation between P5Sn and the panel of guests was measured by direct or competitive isothermal titration calorimetry. We find that the binding free energy toward a guest becomes more negative as the number of sulfate substituents increase. Conversely, the binding free energy of a specific sulfated pillar[5]arene toward a homologous series of guests becomes more negative as the number of NMe groups increases. The ability to tune the host&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;guest affinity by changing the number of sulfate substituents will be valuable in supramolecular polymers, separation materials, and latching applications.

         <title>An Organic EnT Photocatalyst 4CzMeBN and the Application in the Synthesis of cis&#8208;Fused Azetidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic EnT photocatalyst 4CzMeBN was developed as an alternative of widely used Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. 4CzMeBN was prepared facilely from commercially available 4CzIPN and features high triplet state energy and long lifetime of triplet state. The powerful catalytic performance of 4CzMeBN was demonstrated by the photosynthesis of cis&#8208;fused azetidines.







Abstract
A powerful EnT photocatalyst 4CzMeBN has been developed and utilized in the synthesis of cis&#8208;fused azetidines via dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition under visible light. The photocatalyst 4CzMeBN is a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene and features high triplet state energy and long lifetime of triplet state, which would be an alternative to widely used EnT photocatalyst Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. The photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition provides a facile method to synthesize valuable dihydroisoquinolone&#8208;fused azetidines with high efficiency.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Spacer Engineering: Driving Near&#8208;infrared Aggregation Induced&#8208;emission and Mechanofluorochromism in Carbazole&#8208;biscyanostilbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the power of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering, two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes featuring phenyl and thiophene reveal distinct photophysical behaviors. The thiophene derivative shifts to far&#8208;red/NIR solid&#8208;state emission (732&#8197;nm), while the phenyl analogue stands out with exceptional quantum yields and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence. Both compounds demonstrate strong AIE, thermal stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, highlighting their potential for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
In this study, we report the design and synthesis of two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes incorporating phenyl and thiophene &#960;&#8208;spacer units to investigate their distinct impacts on photophysical properties. Notably, the thiophene&#8208;based derivative exhibits remarkable far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) solid&#8208;state emission, with an emission peak at 732&#8197;nm, which shifts to 750&#8197;nm upon mechanical grinding, demonstrating pronounced mechanochromic fluorescence in the NIR region. Although its quantum yield is moderate, the ability to modulate its emission through mechanical stimuli opens exciting opportunities for stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR applications. Conversely, the phenyl&#8208;based analogue shows excellent solid&#8208;state emission at 596&#8197;nm, achieving significantly higher quantum yields, due to suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Both compounds also exhibit strong AIE, with the thiophene system emitting at 730&#8197;nm and the phenyl&#8208;based analogue at 580&#8197;nm in the aggregate state. In addition to their optical properties, both derivatives demonstrate remarkable thermal stability and reversible MFC. These intriguing behaviors highlight the critical role of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering in fine&#8208;tuning solid&#8208;state emission, enhancing stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities, and ensuring robust thermal performance. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the design of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive materials, with promising potential for advancing applications in optoelectronics, bioimaging, and smart sensing technologies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic crystals are an emerging class of engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of molecular crystals.







Abstract
Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of smart engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. Moreover, they have being considered as strong candidates for dynamic elements in applications such as flexible electronic devices, artificial muscles, sensors, and soft robots. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Inspired by the concept of &#8220;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&#8221; in the field of biology, building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of dynamic molecular crystals. Moreover, the hybrid materials can exhibit new functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single object. In this review, the focus was placed on the analysis and discussion of various hybrid strategies and options, as well as the functionalities of hybrid dynamic molecular crystal materials and the important practical applications of composite materials, with the introduction of photomechanical molecular crystals and flexible molecular crystals as a starting point. Moreover, the efficiency, limitations, and advantages of different hybrid methods were compared and discussed. Furthermore, the promising perspectives of smart dynamic molecular crystal materials were also discussed and the potential directions for future work were suggested.

         <title>Critical Evaluation of Childs Method for the NMR Spectroscopic Scaling of Effective Lewis Acidity: Limitations and Resolution of Earlier Discrepancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper evaluates trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde, Childs Method, as a probe to scale effective Lewis acidity by experimental and computational means. The restriction of the binding equilibrium results in an underestimation of effective Lewis acidity. Solvent effects and potential anisotropy effects cause secondary interaction, which yield misleading conclusions and assumptions.







Abstract
Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the Childs method&#8212;employing trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde (TCA)&#8212;gained attention as an NMR&#8208;based technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Despite its steady use, the robustness of Childs method and its correlation with other measures remain underexplored. Previous comparisons between the GB and Childs scales revealed significant discrepancies, suggesting that hard and soft acid/base (HSAB) characteristics may be operative. In this study, we compare thermodynamic data for TCA binding to 117 Lewis acids (representing global Lewis acidity, gLA) with their corresponding NMR&#8208;induced chemical shifts in TCA. Our findings showcase notable deviations that reinforce key distinctions between eLA and gLA perspectives. Moreover, we identify significant limitations in the Childs method. First, the weak donor strength of TCA limits its applicability to only the strongest Lewis acids. Second, the exposed protons of TCA are prone to secondary interactions, obscuring the measurement of true Lewis acidity. Finally, our analysis reconciles discrepancies, refuting earlier assumptions that these arise from HSAB effects.

         <title>Polysilsesquioxane Open Hollow Spheres for Heavy Metal Ions Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres are fabricated through a step&#8208;growth formation process assisted by polystyrene microsphere templates. The openness of the hollow sphere is significantly influenced by the vortex flow generated by magnetic stirring. The material exhibits remarkable adsorption efficiency for heavy metals, attributed to its unique open hollow structure and the presence of thiol groups on its surface.







Abstract
Hollow microspheres with open windows on the shells have shown significant potential in adsorption, catalysis, and drug delivery fields, owing to their low density, large interior volume, high specific surface area, and abundant availability of adsorption sites. However, creating open hollow spheres with structurally stable and entirely organic&#8208;functionalized surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we fabricated polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres using trialkoxysilane containing mercaptopropyl groups under vigorous stirring, employing polystyrene microspheres as a template. Various reaction parameters were explored, revealing stirring speed as the key factor influencing the morphology and openness of the microspheres. By examining the morphology of intermediate products at different reaction times, we proposed a step&#8208;growth mechanism for microsphere formation. The resulting materials exhibited high adsorption capacity and selectivity towards Hg2+ and Pb2+, attributed to the presence of thiol groups and the open&#8208;hollow structure. Our approach provides a robust method for producing open hollow materials with functionalized surfaces, offering potential applications in the adsorption field.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Chloride&#8208;Dependent Uncaging Reaction of Propargyl and Allene&#8208;Protected Substrates by Pd&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the impact of chloride ions, this study highlights the high performance of a Pd(II) complex in the deallenylation uncaging reaction of an allene&#8208;protected fluorophore and a chemotherapeutic drug. The Pd complex demonstrated superior performance in high chloride concentrations, while the novel Alle&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil prodrug was effectively activated at low concentrations of the Pd complex, underscoring its potential for targeted drug activation in cancer therapy.







Abstract
This study investigates the effect of chloride levels on the mode of action of palladium complexes for the activation of propargyl&#8208; and allene&#8208;protected fluorophores and chemotherapeutic drugs through uncaging reactions. Four Pd(II) complexes were synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques to confirm their structure and electronic properties. Kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations revealed that chloride ions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) significantly enhance catalytic efficiency, particularly for allenyl&#8208;protected substrates compared to propargylic counterparts. This enhancement is attributed to the neutral charge nature of the Pd complex. The data suggest that neutral complexes are less prone to chloride exchange by water molecules. Additionally, chloride ligands counterbalance the unusually high stability of the key &#963;&#8208;bound &#951;1&#8208;Pd intermediates in the aquo complexes in PB, leading to an overall higher reactivity. These results highlight the impact of fine&#8208;tuning the electronic properties of the metal center through both designed ligands and environmental factors. Bench evaluations and tests with living breast cancer cells demonstrated that a Pd catalyst complex with a bidentate ligand effectively activates the prodrugs propargyl&#8208;5&#8208;fluorouracil (Prop&#8208;5FU) and allene&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil (Alle&#8208;5FU), the latter being a novel prodrug. The Pd catalyst successfully released the active drug, inducing significant cytotoxicity, especially with Alle&#8208;5FU, which operates at lower catalyst concentrations than Pro&#8208;5FU.

         <title>Adsorption and Thermal Evolution of the Carbonyl&#8208;functionalized Ionic Liquid [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111): A Combined IRAS, STM, and DFT Study</title>

         <dc:description>
In solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to modify noble mtal catalysts. The functionalised IL improves the SCILL by increasing the selectivity, with the functional group playing a crucial role in this process. To understand the mechanisms behind this selectivity control, we performed model studies using surface science techniques under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions.







Abstract
The coating of heterogeneous catalysts with ionic liquids enables precise tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity. Recently, the fundamentals of solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers have been extensively studied. So far, investigations have focused on simple ILs without specialized functional groups. In our current work, we aim to involve functionalized ILs to take advantage of the interactions between these functional groups, the catalyst, and the reactants. In this study, we investigated the interaction, and thermal stability of the carbonyl&#8208;functionalized IL [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111) by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, we performed density functional theory calculations to support our interpretation. At 200&#8197;K and low coverage, the carbonyl group of the [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im]+ cation is oriented parallel to the Pt(111) surface. With increasing coverage, the alkyl chain detaches from the surface and orients towards the vacuum. The [NTf2]&#8722; anion adsorbs parallel to the surface via the oxygen atoms of the SO2 groups. At higher coverage, at least one of the SO2 groups completely detaches from the surface. Upon heating to 250&#8197;K, we observe decomposition and partial desorption of [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2], with further decomposition and desorption occurring between 350 and 400&#8197;K.

         <title>Triskelion&#8208;Shaped Hexabenzocoronenes: Synthesis and Characterization of Tris&#8208;Substituted HBC Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new five step synthetic approach for tris&#8208;iodinated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). These molecules serve as precursors for the synthesis of a library of seven triskelion&#8208;shaped HBCs via Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of the compounds are presented and discussed.







Abstract
The synthesis of unprecedented triskelion&#8208;shaped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with C3, C3h or D3h symmertry is reported. We present a new, five step synthetic access to tris&#8208;iodinated HBC derivatives carrying different solubilizing moieties (tert&#8208;butyl and mesityl), which serve as suitable building blocks for further functionalization. These molecules can undergo Sonogashira cross coupling reactions to obtain a series of seven ethynyl tris&#8208;substituted HBCs. The coupling partners range from carbon&#8208;based aromatic scaffolds (tBu&#8208;benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene) to ligands for metal complexes (bipyridine, phenanthroline, terpyridine, acetylacetone). The optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy resulting in a significant bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum compared to the iodinated starting material. Semiempirical calculations were used to determine the conformation and symmetry of the compounds.

         <title>Soy Protein Adhesive Enhanced Through Supramolecular Interaction with Tannic Acid Modified Montmorillonite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tannic (TA) modified montmorillonite (MMT) MMT@TA was prepared for the production of renewable, high&#8208;performance soy protein adhesives. MMT@TA non&#8208;covalently cross&#8208;links soy proteins through supramolecular interactions, which significantly improves the adhesive bond strength and water resistance. Natural polyphenol tannins provide mold resistance to the adhesive.







Abstract
The use of soybean meal (SM) as an alternative to petroleum&#8208;based resins in wood&#8208;based panels offers a solution to the problem of formaldehyde release. However, inherent drawbacks of soybean meal adhesives, such as poor toughness, low bond strength, and susceptibility to mold, have hindered their further development. In this study, a novel biomass adhesive, SM&#8208;MMT@TA, was developed based on supramolecular interactions between tannic acid (TA), montmorillonite (MMT), and soybean meal. Tannic acid was securely attached to the MMT surface through coordination bonds with Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions, enhancing MMT's compatibility in the matrix via strong interfacial interactions. TA on the surface of MMT@TA effectively bonded with soy protein through strong hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the crosslink density. As a result, the adhesive exhibited a wet shear strength of up to 1.75&#8197;MPa, which represents a 143.05&#8201;% increase compared to unmodified SM adhesive. Moreover, the moisture absorption rate of the adhesive was reduced to 26.79&#8201;%. Furthermore, abundant non&#8208;covalent interactions improved the adhesive's toughness, while natural polyphenols provided additional mold resistance. Overall, this study presents a new strategy for developing renewable, high&#8208;performance biomass&#8208;based adhesives.

         <title>Defining the Synthetic Scope of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides by Quantifying their Electrophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilicities E of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) were determined by following the kinetics of oQM reactions with carbanions in DMSO. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr's reactivity scales facilitates selecting nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs as exemplified by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
A series of aryl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) was synthesised and structurally characterised. Kinetic studies of the nucleophilic additions of carbanions (reference nucleophiles) to oQMs were used to determine second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions (20&#8201;&#176;C, DMSO) at the oQMs&#8217; exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. Analysing the kinetic data by the linear free energy relationship lg k2=sN(N+E) revealed the Mayr electrophilicities E of the oQMs. The electrophilicities E of oQMs correlate linearly with Hammett substituent constants and experimentally determined reduction potentials Epred as well as with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs), which provides valuable tools for prediciting the reactivity of further types of oQMs. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr's reactivity scales enables to predict novel nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs and can productively be used to prepare simple Michael adducts as well as 4+2 or 4+1 cyclisation products as demonstrated in this work by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver-based electrocatalysts (Ag-x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver-based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag-10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag-10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA).

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Non&#8208;Aromatic Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving red organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a significant challenge, especially in a non&#8208;aromatic system. Herein, red RTP with emission at 605 and 645 nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in non&#8208;aromatic carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The CPDs are synthesized via microwave method by using polyacrylic acid (PAA), succinic acid (SA), and traces of phosphoric acid as precursors. Small molecule SA can flexibly enter the polymer cluster of PAA and pair with the isolated carboxyl groups to form CDA. The intrinsic local carbonized structure formed in CPDs can effectively stabilize CDA to achieve red RTP. The red afterglow can last for 1 s to naked eye, and the corresponding lifetimes for emission at 605 and 645 nm were 61 and 45 ms, respectively, after 365 nm excitation off. This work not only reported the non&#8208;aromatic red organic RTP materials for the first time, but also explored CPDs as an effective platform for achieving such non&#8208;aromatic long&#8208;wavelength RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Tunable Dual Emission Mechanism of the Hybridized Local and Charge Transfer (HLCT) and the Excited State Conjugation Enhancement (ESCE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular design of dual&#8208;fluorescent probes requires precise adjustment of the energy levels of two excited states and the energy barrier between them. While the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state has been recently focused as an important excited state for high emission efficiency with a tunable energy level, a dual emission involving the HLCT state has been only achieved with the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) system. Here, a series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving an HLCT excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif is presented as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by changing substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level. The HLCT&#8208;ESCE molecular design with tunable fluorescence properties proposes a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;stabilized charge transfer: An efficient supramolecular approach toward a heterogeneous organic photocatalyst for aerobic oxidation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] andd&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94%).</dc:description>

The high spin state and octahedral coordination of the Fe(III) complex are confirmed by EPR spectra and DFT optimized structure, respectively. The formation constant (&#8208;log K) of Fe(BioL)3 is determined as 45, which is higher than the known, more stable complex [Fe(EDTA)]. The complex Fe(BioL)3 exhibited r1 relaxivity of 3.09 &#177; 0.10 and 1.95 &#177; 0.09 mM&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C and 37 &#176;C, respectively, at 1.41T and pH 7.35 via second&#8208;sphere water interactions as due to the absence of inner water coordination. The interaction of Fe(BioL)3 with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) displayed enhanced relaxivity of 5.16 &#177; 0.15 and 10.0 &#177; 0.19 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1, respectively, at 25 &#176;C and pH 7.3 possibly via lengthening of rotational correlational time. The complex Fe(BioL)3 uptake studies with the avidin, a biotin&#8208;binding protein pocket, showed 46 and 37% enhancements of r1 and r2 relaxivities. Complex Fe(BioL)3 showed 80% cell viability of the human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and 89% of iron has been uptaken into cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Higher Assemblies of Coordination Cage&#8208;Catenanes Linked by Copper(II) Chloride Clusters: Networks and Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;catenanes are chemical constructs where two or more cage&#8208;like molecules or assemblies are mechanically interlocked together. We report a new class of cage&#8208;catenanes where dimeric metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;catenanes are linked into larger assemblies through additional bridging metal chloride links. These crystalline materials are obtained from the reaction of tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene (L1) with Cu(II) salts, and all feature a tetramer of cages where two {Cu3(L1)2(X)6} cages (X = anion) are mechanically interlocked, and link to each other and to another {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}2 cage&#8208;catenane through a planar, linear tetranuclear {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6Cl2} cluster. The complex of discrete tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies (dimers of cage&#8208;catenanes) transforms through solvent&#8208;exchange processes to 1D coordination chain structures through additional {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} bridges between the tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies. Complex [Cu6(L1)4Cl12(H2O)3]&#183;(H2O)&#183;15(DMF) C2 features a 2D coordination network of 63 topology linked through three different Cu(II) clusters, namely {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6}, {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} and a rare linear {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)} linkage. Break&#8208;down of C2 in water likely proceeds through hydrolysis of this unusual linear Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cl bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly Fused Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanopentacenequinone Conjugates: Role of the Cross&#8208;Conjugated, Powerful Electron Acceptor in Promoting Highly Efficient Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetracyanopentacenequinone, a powerful electron acceptor, is fused directly to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system to create a new class of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.&#160; Owing to the direct fusion and electron&#8208;deficient property of tetracyanopentacenequinone, strong intramolecular charge transfer both in the ground and excited states was witnessed.&#160; As a control, porphyrin fused with pentacenequinone was also investigated.&#160; Upon complete spectral and electrochemical characterization, the excited state properties were initially probed by time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, and the occurrence of electron transfer from different excited states was established.&#160; Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed higher exothermic electron transfer (&gt; 600 mV) than the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin systems.&#160; Pump&#8208;probe studies covering broad spatial and temporal regions revealed efficient excited state charge separation.&#160; This was unlike the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin system, where slow charge separation was witnessed only in the case of the zinc derivatives but not the free&#8208;base ones. &#160;The lifetimes of the charge&#8208;separated states ranged between 30&#8208;500 ps depending on the solvent and metal ion in the porphyrin cavity.&#160; The significance of cross&#8208;conjugated tetracyanopentacenequinone fused directly to the porphyrin &#960; system in promoting highly exothermic and efficient charge separation, irrespective of its cross conjugation, is borne out from this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystals for the Sensitive Detection of Visible Light and X&#8208;Rays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent performance and facile fabrication process of perovskite semiconductor materials make them highly promising candidates in the field of optoelectronic devices. Whether for visible light or X&#8208;rays, detectors with low detection limits can better identify weak light signals, significantly reducing the intensity of the received light source during device operation. In particular, for X&#8208;ray detectors, reducing X&#8208;ray dosage can greatly enhance the safety of X&#8208;ray imaging technology. This work develops detectors with low detection limit based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MA3Bi2I9 single crystals. The anisotropy of MA3Bi2I9 and its influence on the detector's performance were investigated in detail. Detectors perpendicular to the (001) crystal plane have better weak light detection capability and require significantly less light intensity compared to devices parallel to the (001) crystal plane. X&#8208;ray detector with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.68 nGyair s&#8210;1 and sensitivity of 5072 &#956;C Gyair&#8210;1 cm&#8210;2 was obtained. The present study offers comprehensive insights into the operational mechanism of layered perovskites, which can provide valuable guidelines for future designs and fabrications of highly sensitive photo and X&#8208;ray detectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF Catalyst for Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles Under Milder Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;member N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing one or more heteroatoms were synthesized in up to 98% yield (&gt; 33 examples). Late stage functionalization to the synthesis of b&#8208;glucuronides inhibitor, antimalarial drug quinine, and the nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin were obtained under milder reactions conditions. A series of mechanistic studies revealed the detection of H2 and H2O2 during the progress of the reactions and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times without much loss in catalytic activities. In&#8208;situ formed defects, pore size enlargement and additional Lewis acid sites within catalyst nanocrystals assisted in attaining high activity and selectivity to N&#8208;heteroarenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This mini&#8208;review focuses on recent developments in hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique structures and properties distinct from those of carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs. Hydroxamates (RCONHO&#8722;), which are bioisosteres of carboxylates (RCOO&#8722;), form MOFs with novel structural motifs and functionalities. In this review, synthetic strategies, structural characteristics, and functional applications of key examples of hydroxamate&#8208;based MOFs are described, providing insights into the influence of the hydroxamate ligand on the MOF properties compared to the carboxylate&#8208;based analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>General Acetal&#8208;Protected Aldehyde Strategy for Facile Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Splendid Crystallinity and Uniform Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallinity and morphology are critical factors that closely related to the properties and applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, the controlled synthesis of COFs with both high crystallinity and uniform morphology remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable polymerization and complex reaction conditions. In this work, we present a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. Of the acetal&#8208;protected aldehydes explored, ethanediol&#8208;protected terephthalaldehyde (Tp&#8208;E) emerged as the most effective, balancing stability and reactivity to yield highly crystalline Py&#8208;COF&#8208;E with a well&#8208;defined hollow spherical morphology and a significantly enhanced BET surface area compared to its aldehyde&#8208;based counterpart Py&#8208;COF. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis. Furthermore, Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF&#8208;E showed superior photocatalytic H&#8322; evolution performance relative to Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF, despite their identical chemical compositions, emphasizing the critical role of crystallinity and morphology in determining functional performance. Overall, this study provides a versatile methodology for the controlled synthesis of COFs and offers valuable insights into the interconnected roles of morphology, crystallinity, and material performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate ligands as an approach to a record high nuclear Cu13Na2&#8208;cage. Synthesis, unique structure, and catalytic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand (silsesquioxane/acetate) complex allows to isolate record high nuclear copper(II) Cu13&#8208;cage (1). In the presence of two additional sodium ions, a unique molecular architecture, with triple combination of ligands (cyclic and acyclic silsesquioxanes as well as acetates), has been formed. The structure was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction based on the use of synchrotron radiation. Complex 1 was evaluated as precatalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone towards &#949;&#8208;caprolactone, employing hydrogen peroxide, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) as oxidants, in an aqueous acidic acetonitrile medium. The direct formation of the lactone from cyclohexane via a tandem peroxidative oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation was also studied. For both substrates, the best results (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone yields up to 100% or 26%, from cyclohexanone or cyclohexane, respectively) were achieved with mCPBA under considerably mild conditions, i.e., conventional heating at 50 &#176;C for 4 h or microwave (MW) irradiation at 80 &#176;C for only 30 minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy of CuOx&#8208;CeO2 Enhances H2O2 Activation and Pollutant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the Fenton process, the development of catalysts with a wide pH range and good stability has been a long&#8208;term goal in water treatment technology. This study proposes a strategy to solve this problem by preparing supported catalysts CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE using an ion exchange reversed loading method. The generation of a large number of interfacial oxygen vacancies with Cu&#8208;OV&#8208;Ce (OV represents an oxygen vacancy site) structures prolongs the O&#8208;O bond of H2O2, promotes the rupture of the peroxide bond of H2O2, and thereby promotes the activation of H2O2 on the surface of the catalyst. The results show that with a H2O2 concentration of 5 mM and CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE at 50 mg/L, the removal rate of bisphenol A is 94.1% in 60 min, in which &#8226;OH dominates the degradation process. Moreover, the system can operate well within a relatively wide pH range (4&#8208;8). This study provides a novel strategy for the design of Fenton catalysts with a wide pH suitability and excellent stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced ArC(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation in Aqueous Media: From DFT Study to Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethylarenes (ArCF3) are crucial bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry, but catalyst&#8208;free and controlled photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond remains a significant challenge. The photo&#8208;induced defluorination acyl fluoride exchange (photo&#8208;DAFEx) of m&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline, induced by ultraviolet light, emerges as a promising novel photo&#8208;click reaction for photoaffinity drug discovery. However, the photophysical properties of NMe2PhF2C(sp3)&#8722;F derivatives and factors affecting ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation in photo&#8208;DAFEx are not yet fully understood, hindering the development of new photo&#8208;defluorination reagents with longer absorption wavelength for the photo&#8208;DAFEx. Herein, the photophysical properties, the related mechanism and their affecting factors of a series of ArCF3 compounds are systematically studied using (TD)DFT methods. The skeleton of aromatic core is found to be intimately related to the absorption wavelength needed for ArC(sp3)&#8208;F bond activation. A photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single&#8208;electron activation model was proposed to rationalize the photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8208;F bond. The transfer of excited electron to C(sp3)&#8208;F antibonding orbital determined the activation. Based on the above knowledge, three novel ArCF3 reagents with extended excitation wavelength were designed and predicted, and the absorption spectra and photo&#8208;defluorination reactivity of two of them with visible absorption wavelength were validated experimentally, which provided a theoretical guidance for designing next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;DAFEx.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Possessing Chiral MIC ligand: Regiospecific sp3 C&#8722;H Activation and Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Ketone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium(III) complex with a chiral&#8208;MIC ligand where the IrIII undergone an additional Ir&#8722;Calkyl bond formation via regiospecific sp3 C&#8722;H bond activation, was synthesized. The chiral&#8208;MIC complex was employed in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketone, and up to 92&#8201;% ee was achieved.







Abstract
Cyclometalation offers a wide number of organometallic metallacycles showing diverse applications. However, such NHC complexes synthesized via an sp3 C&#8722;H bond activation are rare. An iridium(III) complex with a chiral mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MIC) ligand, where the IrIII forms an additional Ir&#8722;C bond via a regiospecific sp3 C&#8722;H bond activation at the N&#8208;methylbenzyl wingtip, was synthesized and characterized. To our best knowledge, this represents the first example of cyclometalated iridium(III) complex possessing a chiral MIC donor ligand. The formation of the complex was followed by 2D correlation NMR spectroscopy and the molecular formula mass was evidenced by ESI&#8208;HRMS mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the IrIII&#8208;MIC complex was unambiguously established by the single crystal XRD data. This cyclometalated IrIII complex was employed in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 4&#8208;bromoacetophenone, and the complex was successful to transfer chirality to the final alcohol molecules (up to 92&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Highly Efficient Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence Performance of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electron&#8208;rich Conjugated Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene units were introduced into three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electron&#8208;rich conjugated structures. The COFs exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) performance. The ECL intensity of COFs with terthienyl units (TTA&#8208;TAPE) is 206 times that of COFs with furan units in the presence of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. A strategy for designing highly efficient AIECL&#8208;active COFs emitters was proposed.







Abstract
Since aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) luminophore overcomes the restriction of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in solid luminescent materials, AIECL luminophore has become a promising material in the field of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineering. However, the lack of ECL emitters with high AIECL performance limits its wide application. Herein, imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with C4 symmetrical tetraphenyl ethylene and C2 symmetrical five&#8208;membered heteroaromatic monomers are designed as ECL emitter in aqueous media. Significantly, the ECL intensity of COFs with terthienyl units (TTA&#8208;TAPE) is 206 times that of COFs with furan units in the presence of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA), which is the result of enhancing ECL signals by increasing the thiophene units and &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation of COFs. Furthermore, the ECL mechanism of these COFs is vested in the bandgap model. Thus, the study provides a strategy for designing highly efficient ECL&#8208;active COFs emitters with excellent AIECL efficiency.

         <title>Mechanistical Study on Substrate&#8208;Controlled Highly Selective [2+2] and [2+3] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Utilizing the same precursor molecules, the substrate&#8208;controlled high&#8208;selective cycloaddition reactions towards non&#8208;benzenoid carbon rings are successfully achieved. The yield towards four&#8208;membered carbon rings via [2+2] cycloaddition reaction is 97&#8201;% on Au(111), while the yield towards five&#8208;membered carbon rings via [2+3] cycloaddition reaction is 96&#8201;% on Ag(111).







Abstract
Polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons have acquired increased interests recently because of their potential applications in electronic devices. On metal surfaces, the selective synthesis of four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings remains challenging due to the presence of diverse reaction pathways. Here, utilizing the same precursor molecule, we successfully achieved substrate&#8208;controlled highly selective cycloaddition reactions towards four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings. A 97&#8201;% yield for four&#8208;membered carbon rings on Au(111), while a 96&#8201;% yield towards five&#8208;membered carbon rings is achieved on Ag(111). The detailed topological structures of the reaction products are carefully examined by bond&#8208;resolving scanning tunneling microscopy (BR&#8208;STM) imaging with a CO functionalized tip. The underlying mechanism of the novel surface&#8208;directed reaction selectivity is elucidated by extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study paves the way for high selective synthesis of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons with non&#8208;benzenoid rings.

         <title>Intermolecular Forces&#8208;Oriented Growth of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructures were constructed through a seeded&#8208;growth process. The self&#8208;assembly of ZIF&#8208;8 particles on the surface of Ni&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;74 matrix having mismatched cell lattices, respectively, resulted in well&#8208;organized core&#8208;satellite type Ni&#8208;MOF@ZIF&#8208;8 and core&#8208;shell type MOF&#8208;74@ZIF&#8208;8 hybrids. The integration of two distinct MOFs was supported by the intermolecular forces.







Abstract
Well&#8208;controlled conjugation of distinct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with dissimilar components and structures into a multi&#8208;component MOF system is important for the design of myriad materials with structural complexity, integrated properties, and desired applications. Herein, we developed an interesting integration strategy that relies on intermolecular force, and which can overcome the difference in lattice parameters. The strategy uses the pre&#8208;formed MOF matrixes as seeds to direct the self&#8208;assembly of secondary MOF particles for the construction of hybrid MOFs. As a proof of concept, the representative core&#8208;satellite&#8208;type Ni&#8208;MOF@ZIF&#8208;8 and core&#8208;shell&#8208;type MOF&#8208;74@ZIF&#8208;8 heterostructures were achieved. Theory calculations elucidate the uncommon formation of well&#8208;defined hybrid MOFs by self&#8208;assembly of secondary ZIF&#8208;8 particles to anchor on Ni&#8208;MOF or MOF&#8208;74 seed surface via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. We anticipate that this work opens an avenue to design the multi&#8208;component MOF systems from different MOFs with lattice mismatching.

         <title>Insights into Structural Diversity and Morphotropic Evolution in A4Th(WO4)4 (A=Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A4Th(WO4)4 series (A=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) shows morphotropic evolution driven by size of alkali metal cations. Transition from Li (compact sheets) to Na/K (3D scheelite superlattices) to Rb/Cs (layered sheets) highlights cation size influence. ThO8 polyhedra remain stable, while W shifts from WO6 to WO4 coordination.







Abstract
A series of four new thorium tungstates, A4Th(WO4)4 (A=Li, K, Rb, Cs), were synthesized using high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Structural studies of the materials reveal distinct structural changes with underlying similarities influenced by the nature of A&#8208;site cations.

space group. K4Th(WO4)4 crystallizes in I41/a space group and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional framework consisting of ThO8 antiprisms and WO4 tetrahedra. Rb4Th(WO4)4 forms in C2/c space group, showcasing a framework with two&#8208;dimensional sheet structure. Cs4Th(WO4)4 is isostructural to Rb4Th(WO4)4 but displays increased interlayer spacing due to the larger ionic radius of Cs. Raman spectroscopy confirms the structural data, revealing distinct vibrational modes that correlate with tungsten coordination changes from WO6 in Li4Th(WO4)4 to WO4 in the Cs4Th(WO4)4. This study demonstrates how variation of alkali metals affects the structural properties of thorium tungstates series, showing a morphotropic evolution as a factor of the ionic radii of the alkali metals.

         <title>Task&#8208;Specific Design of a Porous Aromatic Framework as an Ultrastable Platform for Enantioselective Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxyl&#8208;tagged porous aromatic framework was task&#8208;specifically designed to be used as a platform for a PAF&#8208;immobilized proline&#8208;type chiral catalyst with excellent catalytic activity, diastereoselectivity, enantioselectivity, complete and easy recyclability when catalyzing the aldol reaction.







Abstract
A hydroxyl&#8208;tagged porous aromatic framework PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OH was task&#8208;specifically designed and successfully synthesized targeted toward immobilizing chiral catalysts. Using proline&#8208;type compound as model chiral organocatalyst, PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OH was used as a platform to covalently link proline&#8208;type group. The obtained PAF&#8208;immobilized organocatalyst PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OPro featured high chemical stability in different solvents even under very harsh conditions. PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OPro showed excellent catalytic activity, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity with complete and easy recyclability when catalyzing the aldol reaction between p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone, which could undergo at least 30 cycles without any activity, diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity loss for catalyzing the current reaction.

         <title>Nanohybrids of 2D Black Phosphorus with Phthalocyanines: Role of Interfacial Interactions in Heterostructure Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 2D black phosphorus (bP)&#8211;phthalocyanine nanohybrids were prepared by liquid phase exfoliation of bP crystals with phthalocyanine (Pc) and Mn phthalocyanine (MnPc). Spectroscopic analyses revealed the development of heterostructures due to the interaction of bP with the aromatic and heteroaromatic rings of Pc, as well as coordinative bonds between P atoms and the empty d orbitals of Mn2+ in MnPc&#8208;bP hybrid.







Abstract
New 2D black phosphorus (bP)&#8211;phthalocyanine (Pc) nanohybrids have been synthesized by liquid phase exfoliation of black phosphorus crystals in the presence of two organic dyes: phthalocyanine (Pc) and manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc). The key role of the metal cation in the interfacial interaction between the organic dye and bP nanosheets was demonstrated by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and associated with an electron transfer between the metal cation Mn2+ and bP nanosheets, which resembles a coordinative chemical bond. On the other hand, the interaction between bP nanosheets and pure phthalocyanine is governed by van der Waals forces. The fluorescence of both hybrids is significantly reduced indicating effective separation of the photoinduced charge, implying the formation of a heterojunction between the organic molecules and the bP nanosheets. These findings provide important insights into the interfacial interactions in bP&#8208;Pc nanohybrids that are relevant for application in 2D organic/inorganic devices.

         <title>Advances in Pyridine C&#8722;H Functionalizations: Beyond C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several advanced strategies for C3&#8722; and C4&#8722; selective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines have been developed, offering numerous benefits that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the advantages and limitations of latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation techniques.







Abstract
The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA&#8208;approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it's advantageous for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs. In recent years, innovative strategies for regioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines and azines have emerged, offering numerous benefits such as high regioselectivity, mild conditions, and enabling transformations that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation techniques. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these current methods and aim to inspire further progress in this significant field.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA-approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron-deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it's advantageous for late-stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs. In recent years, innovative strategies for regioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines and azines have emerged, offering numerous benefits such as high regioselectivity, mild conditions, and enabling transformations that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the latest advancements in &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de-aromatization, Minisci-type reactions, and transition metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation techniques. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these current methods and aim to inspire further progress in this significant field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into the Solution Processing of Non&#8208;van der Waals Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase exfoliation of B4C resulted in ultrathin nanosheets in various solevnts. Dispersibility study of B4C enables to determine its Hansen solubility parameter. In situ dispersion stability is investigated using analytical centrifuge and the sedimentation kinetics are analyzed based on instability index, integral extinction, and sedimentation velocity. Solution&#8208;processed B4C showed superior field emission properties compared to bulk B4C.







Abstract
Exfoliation of non&#8208;layered materials is crucial to unleash their enormous potential in wide range of applications. However, the presence of strong non&#8208;van der Waals interactions in all three dimensions makes exfoliation challenging. Boron carbide (B4C), known for its high hardness, holds great potential for diverse applications. In this work, B4C is exfoliated in 29 solvents to determine its Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) and understand the dispersion stability. The experimentally determined HSP values are 19.6, 15.3 and 15.1&#8197;MPa1/2 for dispersive interactions (&#948;D), polar interactions (&#948;P) and hydrogen bonding interactions (&#948;H), respectively. Subsequently, in&#8197;situ dispersion stability is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively from the space&#8208;time resolved extinction profiles employing an analytical centrifuge. The sedimentation kinetics of B4C dispersions are analyzed using instability index, integral extinction and sedimentation velocity. B4C dispersions in solvents like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, isopropyl alcohol, propylene carbonate and formamide exhibited excellent stability. Additionally, B4C nanosheets are utilized to investigate their field emission properties. These nanosheets exhibit a turn&#8208;on electric field of 3.35&#8197;V/&#956;m at an emission current density of 1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and it delivered a large emission current density of ~375&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an applied electric field of 5.7&#8197;V/&#956;m.

         <title>Development of Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactions for the Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Alzheimer Drug Memantine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Memantine hydrochloride, an NMDA receptor antagonist used in Alzheimer's treatment, features an adamantane core with a bridgehead amino group. Its synthesis from acenaphthene involves hydrogenation, skeletal rearrangement, nitration, and reduction. Continuous&#8208;flow reactions were explored for each step to develop a continuous manufacturing process for memantine.







Abstract
Memantine hydrochloride, a non&#8208;competitive antagonist of NMDA&#8208;type glutamate receptors, is known to suppress the progression of symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Possessing a characteristic adamantane skeleton as its core structure and an amino group at the bridgehead position, memantine was synthesized starting from acenaphthene. The synthesis involved nucleus hydrogenation of acenaphthene to perhydroacenaphthene, skeletal rearrangement of perhydroacenaphthene, nitration of 1,3&#8208;dimethyladamantane, and reduction of the nitro groups to an amino group. In each step, continuous flow reactions were investigated to achieve continuous manufacturing of memantine.

         <title>From a P&#8208;Bridging Phosphaketene to &#956;&#8208;Phosphinidenide and &#956;&#8208;Diphosphaurea Units at a Dinickel Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A preorganized pyrazolate&#8208;based dinickel(II) platform is used to host an end&#8208;on P&#8208;bridging PCO&#8722; exhibiting fluxionality within the bimetallic pocket. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal the mechanistic and thermodynamic landscape for nucleophilic attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C or &#8208;P atoms, demonstrating the versatility of the PCO&#8722; synthon and suggesting possible control strategies for its selective transformations.







Abstract
Salt metathesis of dinickel(II) complex LNi2Br (1; L is a dinucleating pyrazolate ligand with two &#946;&#8208;diketiminato chelate arms) with Na(OCP)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(dioxane)2.5 yielded LNi2(PCO) (2) with a P&#8208;bridging phosphaethynolate. Further reaction of 2 with benzyl isocyanide or with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) triggered decarbonylation and gave LNi2(PCN&#8208;CH2Ph) (3) and LNi2P(NHC) (4) with P&#8208;bridging cyanophosphide and NHC&#8208;phosphinidenide, respectively. Electronic structure analysis indicated a &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1 binding mode of the PCO&#8722; anion between the two NiII ions in 2, which is even more pronounced for the [PCN(&#8722;CH2Ph)]&#8722; anion in 3. DFT assessment of the formation mechanism of 4 showed that attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C atom is kinetically preferred but reversible and unproductive, while kinetically more demanding back&#8208;side SN2 attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;P atom triggers CO release with 4 as thermodynamic product. Nucleophilic addition at the phosphaketene&#8208;C could be demonstrated by the strongly exergonic reaction of 2 with KPPh2, giving unstable K[LNi2(P(O)CPPh2)] (5) with a P&#8208;bridging and K+&#8208;stabilized diphosphaurea derivative. All new complexes 2&#8211;5 have been comprehensively characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Ni2+ in Distorted Octahedral Geometry toward High&#8208;Efficiency NIR&#8208;II/III emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LaTiTaO6: Ni2+ phosphor synthesized via the solid&#8208;phase method exhibits an external quantum yield (EQY) of 9.00&#8201;%, which is the highest reported value for singly Ni2+&#8208;doped phosphors to date. The higher EQY is attributed to Ni2+ being situated in octahedral lattice sites with significant distortion, thus enhancing the absorption efficiency. Finally, the potential application of this phosphor in material analysis is demonstrated.







Abstract
Ni2+ activated phosphor has attracted wide attention because it can be radiated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) II&#8211;III region; however, the low external quantum yield (EQY) hinders its further application (most are below 8&#8201;%). In this work, distortion of crystallographic site strategy is proposed to enhance EQY. LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ exhibits an NIR emitting spectrum centered at 1450&#8197;nm with an EQY of ~9.00&#8201;%, which has been the highest EQY of reported Ni2+ single&#8208;doped phosphor. Distortion degrees of the octahedral geometry in LaTiTaO6 and LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ changing from 0.038 to 0.047 result in the absorption efficiency of 38.6&#8201;% due to the breaking of parity forbidden of the d&#8208;d transition, further improving the EQY. Besides, LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ mixed with LaTiTaO6: 0.04Cr3+ phosphors have demonstrated their application for spectral analysis. This work provides a new idea for constructing efficient NIR&#8208;II to NIR&#8208;III phosphors.

LaTiTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 0.004Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits an NIR emitting spectrum centered at 1450&#8197;nm with an EQY of ~9.00&#8201;%, which has been the highest EQY of reported Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; single-doped phosphor. Distortion degrees of the octahedral geometry in LaTiTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and LaTiTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 0.004Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changing from 0.038 to 0.047 result in the absorption efficiency of 38.6&#8201;% due to the breaking of parity forbidden of the d-d transition, further improving the EQY. Besides, LaTiTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 0.004Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mixed with LaTiTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 0.04Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphors have demonstrated their application for spectral analysis. This work provides a new idea for constructing efficient NIR-II to NIR-III phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli Induced Reversible Switching Between a Self&#8208;Assembled 2&#8208;Catenane and the Constituent Coordination Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic coordination rings have been accomplished. The ring separation could be realized when a suitable guest moiety acted as stimulus whereas sequestering the bound guest using another stimulus (i.&#8201;e. powerful host) resulted back the 2&#8208;catenane.







Abstract
A pair of comparable sized C&#8208;shaped bis&#8208;monodentate ligands (L1 and L22+) and a linear bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (L3) complementing to the terminal&#8208;lengths of the C&#8208;shaped ligands have been identified. One&#8208;pot combination of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+, L1 and L3 (2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio) in water resulted an octa&#8208;cationic 2&#8208;catenane, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L1)(L3)]28+ in which two identical tetra&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination rings are interlocked; however, a guest bound coordination ring was formed in presence of a selected di&#8208;anionic guest. Complexation of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+ with a mixture of L22+ and L3 (2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio) in water resulted the hexa&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination ring, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L2)(L3)]6+ whereas a guest bound coordination ring was formed in the presence of the di&#8208;anionic guest. Addition of the guest to the preformed octa&#8208;cationic catenane caused ring separation to favour the guest&#8208;bound ring. This guest bound ring could be reverted to the 2&#8208;catenane by sequestering the bound guest using the relatively electron deficient hexa&#8208;cationic coordination ring. Thus, a design principle for reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic&#8208;rings using anion&#8208;binding/&#8208;sequestering as the core concept has been established.

         <title>Twofold 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization as a Route Toward Multi&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Nanographenes Built on a 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly fluorescent N&#8208;doped nanographenes were prepared via straightforward three&#8208;steps route in overall yield reaching 25&#8201;%. This strategy is compatible with the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and is amenable to computational prediction of the output of the reaction based on symmetry of orbitals.







Abstract
Here we present a highly versatile synthetic strategy based on twofold 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as a novel approach towards centrosymmetric multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped nanographenes build around an electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. A straightforward synthesis from readily available substrates offers a unique possibility of fusing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole subunit not only with carbocyclic building blocks, such as electron&#8208;deficient phenanthrenes, chrysenes, or [4]helicenes, but also with heterocyclic systems, such as benzo[b]furan and 5&#8208;thiatruxene. The clear advantage of this strategy is that there is no requirement to assemble complex scaffolds possessing bromoaryl units since bromine atom is introduced by bromination of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core which, because of its exceptionally electron&#8208;rich character, is straightforward reaction. The obtained &#967;&#8208;shaped and S&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing 10 or more fused rings, exhibit visible&#8208;range emissions characterized by fluorescence quantum yields reaching 48&#8201;%. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization is kinetically favourable over photo&#8208;induced direct arylation. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular double helix from a tetrapeptide and direct visualization by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and quantum mechanics calculations of the 310&#8208;helical peptide Z&#8208;(Aib)2&#8208;L&#8208;Dap(Boc)&#8208;Aib&#8208;NHiPr (Aib, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid; Dap, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, t&#8208;butoxycarbonyl). The peptide forms a double&#8208;helical superstructure, studied by XRD and STM. Such architecture is rare in short peptides. Here, we show, by combining XRD, STM that this intriguing conformational feature is not driven by crystal packing; rather, it is an intrinsic property of this peptide. Indeed, the double helix is clearly detected also by STM, where crystal packing cannot be invoked. XRD reveals that intermolecular H&#8208;bonds stabilize two left&#8208;handed supra&#8208;helices (tertiary structure) that develop around a 6&#8208;fold screw axis. Then, two supra&#8208;helices are intertwined in a quaternary structure as a left&#8208;handed, double supra&#8208;helix, where C&#8211;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a crucial role. STM images show the formation of long, isolated &#8220;necklaces&#8221; (&gt; 110 nm). They are of left and right helical handedness. Their size agrees with the XRD finding. DFT calculations allowed us to weigh the contribution of the different intermolecular interactions in the two single supra&#8208;helices and the supramolecular double&#8208;helix. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that the contribution of the C&#8208;H&#8943;&#960; interactions to the binding energies is close to 50%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Ammonia/Amine Boranes and Related Transformations Catalysed by Group 4 Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia boranes and amine boranes are main group analogues of alkanes, which are characterised by their large gravimetric hydrogen content. This hydrogen can be released in dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation reactions to obtain B&#8208;N oligomers and polymers that are of importance as precursors for functional B&#8208;N materials. Furthermore, amine boranes are potent reagents for application in transfer hydrogenation reactions, representing a versatile, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to the use of gaseous hydrogen for the reduction of organic compounds. Compared to late transition metals,&#160;complexes of readily available and comparatively inexpensive electropositive group 4 metals have been used to a much lesser extent. This review summarises the developments in the field of dehydrocoupling of amine boranes and transfer hydrogenation with these reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We analyse the background for these developments using examples and reaction mechanisms and provide an outlook for future developments in this field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Coupling of Flavylium Dyes with Plasmodione Analogues: Towards New Redox&#8208;Sensitive Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of redox&#8208;sensitive molecular fluorescent probes for the detection of redox changes in Plasmodium falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells remains of interest due to the limitations of current genetically encoded biosensors. This study describes the design, screening and synthesis of new pro&#8208;fluorophores based on flavylium azido dyes coupled by click chemistry to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide, the key metabolite of the potent redox&#8208;active antimalarial plasmodione. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these probes were evaluated, focusing on their fluorogenic responses. The influence of the redox status of the quinone and the length of the PEG chain separating the fluorophore from the electrophore on the photophysical properties was investigated. The fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer is reversible and of high amplitude for probes in oxidized quinone forms and fluorescence is reinstated for reduced hydroquinone forms. Our results demonstrate that shortening the PEG chain has the effect of enhancing the fluorogenic response, likely due to non&#8208;covalent interactions between the two chromophores. All these systems were evaluated for their antiparasitic activities and fluorescence imaging suggests the efficacy of the fluorescent flavylium dyes in P. falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells, paving the way for future parasite imaging studies to monitor cellular redox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel/Photoredox Catalyzed Aryl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkyl Boronic Esters as Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel/photoredox dual catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with alkylboron compounds is one of the effective methodologies for the construction of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Although elegant results have been achieved by using alkyl trifluoroborates as alkyl radical precursors, the generation of alkyl radicals from readily available alkyl boronic esters is still limited due to their high oxidation potential. We disclosed here that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. The reaction featured with a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive substances. In addition, the method was also successfully extended to alkyl boronic acids. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Designs for Cell&#8208;Interfacing Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing synthetic materials to interact with cells offers significant promise for understanding natural cellular processes and manipulating cell behaviors beyond nature&#8217;s capabilities. Peptide assemblies are particular promising in this regard, as they have demonstrated efficacy in promoting cell differentiation, repair, and regeneration as supportive scaffolds. However, distinct gaps persist between natural and synthetic assembly systems in various aspects. This Concept review explores representative studies focusing on developing chemical strategies to design peptide assemblies with precise control over displayed molecules, adjustable molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. This paper would inspire more fundamental studies on molecular assemblies and foster inter&#8208;disciplinary interests in material applications, advancing the interplay between natural cells and synthetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Transition&#8208;Dipole Stacking of Conjugated Organic Molecules: Structure, Exciton Behavior and Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic conjugated molecules have gained widespread application as organic semiconductors due to their unique optoelectronic properties. The rigidity of these large conjugated structures facilitates strong intermolecular interactions, which significantly influence their properties in the solid state through various molecular arrangements. The study of the relationship among molecular arrangement, exciton behavior, and optoelectronic properties is an eternal research topic. Cross&#8208;dipole stacking is a specific molecular arrangement that demonstrates unique characteristics and has received continuous attention over the past decades. This mini&#8208;review will first discuss the unique exciton behaviors in cross&#8208;dipole stacking based on exciton models, including weak exciton coupling and suppression of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These exciton behaviors, determined by molecular stacking arrangements, are fundamental to the optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems. Next, we will introduce well&#8208;defined cross&#8208;dipole systems and summarize their design principles from a molecular structure perspective. Finally, we will present the specific optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems and their outstanding performance, such as high solid&#8208;state luminescence, good charge carrier mobility, and significant CD/CPL. Through this mini&#8208;review, we hope to enhance the understanding of cross&#8208;dipole stacking, contributing to the construction of such systems, the exploration of excited&#8208;state behaviors, and the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3 Catalyzed Regiodivergent Thioetherifications of Alkenes via Thiiranium Intermediates: Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of selective alkene functionalization is a continuing challenge in the chemical community. In this study, we develop a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes using 10 mol% tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] as a catalyst and N&#8211;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating reagent. This metal&#8208;free borane catalyzed C&#8211;S bond forming method is utilized for a Csp2&#8211;H sulfenylation reaction to synthesize an array of diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives with good to excellent yields (25 examples, up to 91% yield). Some of the products exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen properties used in organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (OLEDs), chemical sensors, and biological imaging units. Depending upon the starting alkene, Csp3&#8211;S sulfenylation products could also be generated regioselectively. A variety of allylic thioethers from &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted styrenes were isolable in good yields and selectivities (14 examples, up to 67% yield). The DFT&#8208;supported mechanistic study confirms that the reaction proceeds via a thiiranium ion intermediate, where the regioselectivity and product formation are determined by the alkene substituents which influences the activation barriers and energy profiles. Diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives can also be efficiently transformed into a range of synthetically valuable compounds, including vinyl sulfoxides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed O&#8208;Arylation of N&#8208;Protected Amino Alcohols with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first effective base metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol&#8208;containing N&#8208;Boc protected amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chlorides, affording access to new and useful N&#8208;protected aryloxyamine compounds, is reported.







Abstract
The aryloxyamine motif is a prominent pharmacophore in drug design and development. While these biologically relevant structures could in principle be sustainably assembled from the base metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;arylation of inexpensive and abundant amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chlorides, reports of such challenging C&#8722;O bond formations with useful scope are lacking. In response, we report herein the hitherto unknown Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;protected amino alcohols (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with (hetero)aryl chlorides. Also presented are chemoselective sequential/telescoped C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings of the unprotected amino alcohol prolinol to afford an unsymmetrical diarylated product.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Perfluorinated Amphiphilic Cyanine Dye into Branched Tubular J&#8208;Aggregates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and structural investigations of a novel perfluorinated amphiphilic cyanine dye are reported. The formation of J&#8208;aggregates possessing several supramolecular double&#8208;layered morphologies based on cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies is described. For the first time the transformation of vesicles into a population of branched nanotubes is shown.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly process is governed by the individual constituents of molecules through precise non&#8208;covalent interactions. Amphiphilic cyanines are intriguing in supramolecular chemistry due to the large polarizability of their delocalized &#960;&#8211;electron systems, their tuneable optical properties and their ability to form well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled structures in different media. Here we present the synthesis of a novel tetrahydroxy amphiphilic carbocyanine dye with perfluoro alkylated chains &#8722;(CH2)2&#8722;(CF2)5&#8722;CF3 as hydrophobic segments and aminoproanediol as hydrophilic segment. The target molecule was synthesized in a multi&#8208;step process, which illustrates the complexity and precision required to achieve the desired structure. This study focuses on the comparison of the influence of C8H17 and C8H4F13 tails and the effects of carboxylated and non&#8208;ionic aminopropanediol head groups as substituents on self&#8208;assembly of the TBC dye. Absorption and fluorescence measurements show similar spectroscopic properties to cyanine dyes studied previously. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) reveals formation of multiple supramolecular aggregates. As supramolecular assembly is very sensitive to sample preparation, multilamellar or multivesicular vesicles are obtained preferentially in vigorously vortexed solutions. Moreover, time&#8208;dependent tube formation was observed in gently mixed solutions. Thereby, we could follow the growing mechanism of the unprecedented Y&#8208;junctions of supramolecular tubes.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis and structural investigations of a novel perfluorinated amphiphilic cyanine dye are reported. The formation of J-aggregates possessing several supramolecular double-layered morphologies based on cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies is described. For the first time the transformation of vesicles into a population of branched nanotubes is shown.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Stereodivergent Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable stereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation of readily accessible glycals is described herein. This technique is enabled by a site&#8208;selective incorporation of a hydrogen atom across an olefin prior to C&#8722;N bond&#8208;formation, with stereodivergency being dictated on kinetic or thermodynamic grounds. This technique is characterized by its operational simplicity, exquisite selectivity and broad applicability, not only complementing classical protocols for preparing N&#8208;glycosides but also offering a new gateway to expedite the rapid and reliable access to molecular architectures of relevance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a stereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals. The reaction is enabled by addition of an in&#8197;situ generated nickel hydride across an olefin prior to C&#8722;N bond&#8208;formation. Stereodivergence can be accomplished on kinetic or thermodynamic grounds, thus giving access to either &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides with equal ease. The protocol is distinguished by its operational simplicity, generality and exquisite selectivity, thus offering a new gateway to expedite the synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Dispersion Forces&#8208;Driven Hierarchical Assembly of Protein&#8208;Like Lanthanide Octamers and Emergent CPL</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that solvent conformation adaptation enhanced dispersion forces drive the hierarchical assembly of the trinuclear circular helicate into protein&#8208;like supramolecular octamers, exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is a prevalent strategy employed by nature to construct sophisticated biomacromolecules, such as proteins. However, the construction of protein&#8208;like superstructures that rely on weaker dispersion forces&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the first example of dispersion forces driving the high&#8208;order assembly of the lanthanide trinuclear circular helicate [HNEt&#8323;]&#8323;[Eu&#8323;(LL)&#8326;] (&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1) into a protein&#8208;like lanthanide octamer ((&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1)&#8328;&#8208;2). Within the octamer, the forty&#8208;eight (48) menthol groups on the ligands and eighty&#8208;four (84) 1,4&#8208;dioxane solvent molecules contribute to enhanced dispersion forces through conformational adaptation and size&#8208;matching effects. These enhanced dispersion forces not only drive the formation of the hierarchical superstructure but also result in a four&#8208;level chirality transfer from the menthol to the octamer. Benefiting from the homochirality of Eu3+, the octamer is endowed the strong circularly polarized emission (|glum|=0.34, &#934;overall=41&#8201;%). This understanding of how dispersion forces drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly provides a foundation for the directed fabrication of more fascinating superstructures.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Reduced Cu3N Nanocrystals Enable High&#8208;Efficiency Ammonia Synthesis and Zinc&#8208;nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N is synthesized through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. The Cu3N exhibits NH3 yield of 173.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with FENH3 reaching 91.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, which assembles a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery.







Abstract
Nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) involves an 8&#8208;electron transfer process and competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction process, resulting in lower yields and Faraday efficiency (FE) in the process of NH3 synthesis. Especially, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu0 and Cu+) have been investigated in the field of NO3RR due to the energy levels of d&#8208;orbital and the least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) &#960;* of nitrate's orbital. Based on the above, we synthesized a Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N (Cu+) through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Through various characterization analyses, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu+) are the key active sites in reduction reactions, making Cu3N a potential catalyst for ammonia synthesis. The research results indicate the application of Cu3N catalyst in NO3RR shows the best NH3 yield of 173.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with FENH3 reaching 91.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of Cu catalyst without N. In addition, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery based on Cu3N electrode also exhibits an NH3 yield of 39.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 63.0&#8201;% FENH3, and a power density of 2.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as stable cycling charge&#8208;discharge stability for 5&#8197;hours. This work guides the application of Cu3N enhanced regulation of the active site in the electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 from NO3RR.

         <title>An Ion Pair Receptor for Selective Solid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of LiCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized a new ion pair receptor (2) consisting of a cone&#8208;calix[4]arene bearing a combination of ethyl esters and ethers as a cation binding site and a calix[4]pyrrole subunit acting as an anion binding site. Ion pair receptor 2 complexes LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl among alkali metal chloride salts with distinct complexation modes and affinities in 10% methanol&#8208;d4 in chloroform&#8208;d. For instance, relatively small Li+ and Na+ cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the functionalized calix[4]arene lower rim with Cl&#8208; being hydrogen bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs while the larger Cs+ cation is bound to the cone&#8208;shaped calix[4]pyrrole cavity via a &#960;&#8208;cation interaction. By contrast, in the co&#8208;presence of all MCl salts (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), receptor 2 binds LiCl with complete selectivity. Besides, receptor 2 is capable of extracting LiCl selectively into a chloroform or a dichloromethane organic phase from its solid source containing all other MCl salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Dimerization of Methylcyclopentadiene inside Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular confinement within rigid macrocyclic receptors can trigger catalytic activity and steer the selectivity of organic reactions. In this work, the dimerization of methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) isomers in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was found to display, besides a large rate acceleration, a striking regioselectivity in aqueous solution at pH 3, different from the thermodynamic products predominating in the absence of the supramolecular catalyst. Among the different possible regioisomers and diastereomers, the endo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3a,4,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoindene adduct was selectively formed, which is otherwise found only as a minor product in the dimerization of neat MCPD or in commercial dimeric mixtures. This product originates from the reaction of the heteroternary complex of 1&#8208;MCPD and 2&#8208;MCPD within CB7, in which the methyl groups are positioned in an "anti&#8208;diaxial" arrangement and point towards the open portals of the macrocycle, resulting in a preferred packing of the reacting cyclopentadiene rings. The selectivity of the dimerization of MCPD in the absence and presence of CB7 is supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Insert abstract text here.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing Alkyne&#8208;Nitrone Cycloaddition for the Convenient Multi&#8208;Component Assembly of Protein Degraders and Biological Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have become a popular therapeutic strategy, and the development of multi&#8208;functional PROTACs has added complexity to their synthetic process. Although click reactions have been widely applied to prepare highly functionalized biomolecules, most of them are limited to two&#8208;component reactions, restricting the creation of more complex structures. Here, we developed a convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), which can be extended to a 3&#8208;component reaction when combined with nitrone formation. Using the 2&#8208;component assembly, we demonstrated the targeted protein degradation with both preassembled and in&#8208;cell assembled PROTACs. This strategy was also applied to facilitate the screening of E3 ligases in PROTACs and the preparation of various biological probes. Moreover, the 3&#8208;component assembly, via sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, enabled the synthesis of trifunctional 3&#8208;component PROTACs. The N&#8208;substituent, serving as an additional functional moiety, was designed as a photocage for sterically controlling PROTAC activity. The 3&#8208;component assembly can be further modified to provide additional control or enhance the cell&#8208;targeting ability of PROTACs. In short, our multi&#8208;component SPANC assembly strategy offers a modular and versatile synthetic platform for creating multi&#8208;functional PROTACs and biological probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile fabrication of novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite photocatalyst for boosting photocatalytic tetracycline degradation and hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a novel ternary Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite composite for photocatalytic H2 production and TC degradation through S&#8208;scheme electron transport. The S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction was successfully constructed on zeolite surface through calcination and precipitation processes. The results indicated that Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86% in 180 min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205 min&#8208;1 which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag3PO4 (0.00554 min&#8208;1) and g&#8208;C3N4 (0.00161 min&#8208;1), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H2 production rate (2748.6 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1) was achieved over Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g&#8208;C3N4 and Ag3PO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC&#8208;MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds (HBs), prevalent strong interactions in organic compounds, can effectively constrain single bond rotation, leading to rigid planar configurations. This rigidity enhances emission efficiency and narrows the emission spectrum of luminescent materials. Recent advances have leveraged HBs to advance high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. However, their application in multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF emitters remains limited. We herein developed MR&#8208;TADF emitters incorporating intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs) with pyrimidine as the HB acceptor. The rigid planar conformation induced by IHBs significantly improved photoluminescence quantum yield, extended emission wavelength, reduced full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and decreased non&#8208;radiative decay rates for BN&#8208;2Pm compared to BN&#8208;5Pm. Devices based on BN&#8208;2Pm achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.5%, a current efficiency of 102.3 cd A&#8722;1, a power efficiency of 84.6 lm W&#8722;1, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.71). In contrast, BN&#8208;5Pm exhibited lower values: 14.6%, 36.8 cd A&#8722;1, 27.6 lm W&#8722;1, and (0.12, 0.57), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(diimino)palladium Nanosheets as Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(diimino)palladium (PdDI) coordination nanosheets were synthesized using gas&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation. The catalytic activity evaluation for hydrogen evolution reaction revealed the remarkable catalytic performance of activated PdDI which is comparable to that of metallic platinum despite using a tiny number of precious metals.







Abstract
Development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) is necessary to achieve environmentally friendly and sustainable hydrogen production. To reduce cost and to circumvent the scarcity of platinum, the most efficient catalyst for HER, it is essential to develop catalysts using ubiquitous base metals or minimal amounts of precious metals. Bis(diimino)metal (MDI) coordination nanosheets are potential HER catalysts because their electric conductivities, two&#8208;dimensionality, and porous structures provide large surface areas and efficient mass and electron transfer. In addition, with sparse metal arrangements in their chemical structures, nanosheets can reduce the amount of metal needed. We synthesized bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI) as a coordination polymer composed of bis(diimino)palladium, with semiconducting characteristics, using gas&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation. These electrochemically synthesized PdDIs exhibit remarkable catalytic performance with overpotential reaching 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 34&#8197;mV, a Tafel slope of 47&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and an exchange current density of 2.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after appropriate activation. This performance is closely comparable to that of metallic platinum. An ex&#8208;situ investigation of the activation process revealed that reduction of the divalent Pd center in bis(diimino)palladium produced a composite of Pd(0) species and PdDI, combining high catalytic activity with smooth electron transfer.

         <title>Imaging Dihydrogen Bond&#8208;Driven Assembly of Borazine on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first observation of dihydrogen bonding (DHB) in borazine assemblies on a Au(111) surface using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the stabilization mechanisms behind single and double DHB configurations, revealing the crucial role of DHBs in the self&#8208;assembly processes of borazine on metal surfaces.







Abstract
Dihydrogen bonding (DHB) is a peculiar type of attractive interaction occurring between a partially positively charged hydrogen atom and a partially negatively charged hydrogen atom. Borazine represents a prototypical molecule exhibiting dihydrogen bonding in both gas phase, as well as in its crystalline form. For borazine assemblies on solid surfaces, a direct observation and characterization of dihydrogen bonding has remained elusive, possibly due to an intricate interplay of substrate&#8208;molecule and intermolecular interactions. Here we present evidence of dihydrogen bonding occurring in borazine assemblies on a Au(111) surface. By means of low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveiled distinct configurations, exhibiting single and double dihydrogen bonding. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the interplay between substrate adsorption and intermolecular interactions to stabilize the formation of borazine dimers on Au(111). The dimers constitute the building blocks for the formation of larger assemblies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing pollution problems, green and sustainable energy supply attracts worldwide attention. Hydrogen is a green and high&#8208;density energy substance, and photocatalytic hydrogen generation is an effective and sustainable method.&#160;Therefore, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts plays a crucial role in practical application. Porous frameworks with large surface areas and diversified structures are considered promising candidates for photocatalysts. This review summarizes the recent progress on porous frameworks and their derivatives through fine&#8208;tuning structural components in terms of building monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic production of hydrogen. A&#160;detailed correlation is conducted between the structural features of porous frameworks and photocatalysis capability.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of Glucose&#8208;Induced Low Crystallinity NiCo&#8208;Based Layered Double Hydroxides for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH), the synthesis of low&#8208;crystallinity NiCoLDH was induced by the adsorption of glucose and NiCoLDH. The results showed that glucose could not only effectively regulate the pore structure and morphology of NiCoLDH, but also had a regular effect on crystallinity. Pure phase NiCoLDH had higher crystallinity. When the mass of glucose is 0.05 g, the prepared NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is a short&#8208;range ordered structure embedded in the amorphous matrix. The crystallinity of the product decreases further with the further increase of glucose mass. Since the ordered structures have higher electrical conductivity, and amorphous structures have more defects and active sites, the structure of NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is conducive to achieving the best electrochemical performance. Electrochemical test results show that NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 has a high specific capacitance, about 12 times that of the pure phase NiCoLDH, the mass of glucose is higher than or below 0.05 g, the specific capacitance will be further reduced. NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 and activated carbon assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor have a power density of 400 W kg&#8208;1 at an energy density of 32.7 Wh kg&#8208;1. This study provides a new idea for obtaining excellent electrochemical properties by adjusting LDH crystallinity.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Functionalization Reverses Hypsochromic Luminescence Shifts in Platinum(II) Complexes of Benzannulated NCN&#8208;Coordinating Ligands&#8225;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands containing phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) have presented notable exceptions to the conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. The counterintuitive blue shifts have been attributed to the peculiar structure of phenanthridines, whose ground states are dominated by imine&#8208;bridged biphenyl resonance contributors. They serve to isolate the C=N unit electronically from the rest of the ligand framework and allow the C=N moiety to act as a &#8216;shock&#8208;absorber&#8217;, buffering against larger molecular distortions in a molecule&#8217;s excited state, and reducing the observed pseudo&#8208;Stokes&#8217; shift in emission. Here, we provide experimental evidence for this assertion in the form of a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine&#8217;s tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts. The synthesis, full characterization, and comparison of 2&#8208;quinolinyl and 6&#8208;phenanthridinyl exemplars is provided, supported by a detailed theoretical treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Carbon&#8208;centered Radical Showing Six Amphoteric Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable hydrocarbon radical with four six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to a heptacycle was obtained by ortho fusion in a suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted diphenylfluorene and subsequent re&#8208;establishment of the conjugation. The radical was obtained in five consecutive steps from commercially available starting materials with a total yield of 34%; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the stability of the radical. This cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) was characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy and by cyclic voltammetry. Quantum chemical calculation disclosed further properties and led to simulated spectra (spin densities, aromaticity, orbital energies, and UV/Vis/NIR). This radical is best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings; this resonance formula shows the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. Its triradical character was computed to be very small and can be neglected. The five&#8208;membered rings show notable antiaromatic character, especially in the central ring. The constitution of the radical could be further substantiated by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of its direct precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Gels Derived from Primary Ammonium salts of Naproxen and its Amino Acid Derivatives: Design, Synthesis, Structures and its Application as Anti&#8208;cancer Agent Against Melanoma Cell B16&#8208;F10</title>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular synthon approach was employed to develop a self&#8208;drug&#8208;delivery system based on organic salt based supramolecular gelators. One such key gelator NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA derived from naproxen&#8208;phenylalanine conjugate and phenethylamine showed ability to gel both water and organic solvents. Supramolecular interactions such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#8230;&#960; were probed by variable&#8208;temperature 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in the hydrogelation process of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA. Single crystal structures of nine out of twelve salts were determined and the supramolecular synthon present therein was carefully analyzed. Intriguing insights of the gel&#8208;network structure was also investigated by structure&#8208;property correlation based on single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of gelator/nongelator salts. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer property against cancer cells (B16&#8208;F10. HeLa and A375); it was found non&#8208;cytotoxic against normal cell lines (E.derm and HEK&#8208;293) at comparable concentrations as revealed by MTT assays. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA also displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer behaviour against B16&#8208;F10 (scratch assay) and HeLa (multi&#8208;cellular tumour spheroid). The methyl salicylate gel of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA displayed shape&#8208;sustaining, load&#8208;bearing, self&#8208;healing properties along with rheoreversibility, which are considered important for topical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation Between NMR Coupling Constants and &#963;&#8208;Donating Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed comparison of &#963;&#8208;donation indicators, including the calculated 1JC&#8722;H coupling constant, across a broad spectrum of diverse carbenes provides new insights into their strengths and limitations. This study highlights the utility of 1JC&#8722;H for assessing &#963;&#8208;donation in structurally similar carbenes, while revealing its constraints for carbenes with significantly different frameworks, offering guidance for evaluating electronic properties.







Abstract
Is the 1JC&#8722;H coupling constant for protonated carbene a relevant measure of its &#963;&#8208;donation ability? This paper addresses this question by comparing calculated 1JC&#8722;H values with various experimental and theoretical approaches across a broad spectrum of carbene compounds. We examined Arduengo&#8208;type NHCs based on the 2&#8208;imidazolylidene scaffold and many other derivatives with modified frameworks, including carbenes with extended, saturated, or conjugated rings, reduced heteroatom stabilization, alternative heteroatoms, permanently charged carbenes, acyclic carbenes, amidocarbenes, and cyclic amino(alkyl/aryl) carbenes, carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between different parameters associated with &#963;&#8208;interaction, such as 1JC&#8722;H, Huynh electronic parameter (HEP), &#963;&#8208;donation from ETS&#8208;NOCV, and lone pair energy. Notably, the best correlation was observed between 1JC&#8722;H and the ETS&#8208;NOCV method, particularly for mono&#8208; and diaminocarbenes, highlighting the utility of 1JC&#8722;H in comparing &#963;&#8208;donation among structurally similar carbene types. However, the use of 1JC&#8722;H as a universal measure across all carbene classes appears limited, especially when considering carbenes with significantly different structural frameworks. While HEP is less effective for carbenes with diverse structural backbones, our study suggests that 1JC&#8722;H has potential across a broader range of systems. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that lone pair energy reflects basicity rather than &#963;&#8208;donor ability.

         <dc:description>
We present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes. This approach efficiently forms various aminocyclobutane esters and amides, incorporating N&#8208;nucleophiles like imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives resulting in enhanced molecular diversity for medicinal chemistry applications.







Abstract
Herein, we present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from commercially available bromocyclobutanes. This method enables the efficient formation of various heterocyclic aminocyclobutane esters and amides using simple reagents. Notably, N&#8208;nucleophiles such as imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives were successfully incorporated, enhancing the chemical diversity of small ring building blocks for medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Developing bio&#8208;carbon matrices for the encapsulation of silicon nanoparticles for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion battery anode materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the practical application of Si&#8208;based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation. Here, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and  coconut silk bio&#8208;carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through&#8208;holes and ample micropores, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through&#8208;holes and well&#8208;distributed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what's more, the good dispersion of Si NPs increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si. The rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can form a certain chemical force with silicon particles, and further stabilize the nano silicon particles. Hence, the CSC/Si electrode revealed an excellent capacity retention of 82.8% at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a simple universal high&#8208;throughput method to obtain anode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties and promotes the further development of Si/C composites.</dc:description>

Hence, the CSC/Si electrode revealed an excellent capacity retention of 82.8% at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a simple universal high-throughput method to obtain anode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties and promotes the further development of Si/C composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Toolset of Biomolecular NMR with Efficient and Cost&#8208;Effective 17O&#8208;Labeling via Bacterial Expression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a cost&#8208;effective method for amino acid&#8208;specific 17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins using a bacterial expression system and rapid 17O&#8208;labeled amino acid synthesis. Successful 17O labeling is demonstrated in proteins like CrgA and FtsQ. This approach broadens access to 17O&#8208;NMR, enabling deeper insights into protein biophysics and biochemistry.







Abstract
Oxygen plays a central role in biomolecular structures and functions, with 17O&#8197;NMR emerging as a powerful tool for elucidating biomolecular properties. However, the low natural abundance of the NMR&#8208;active isotope, 17O (0.0373&#8201;%), presents a significant hurdle to its widespread application. Here, we introduce a rapid and cost&#8208;effective approach for amino acid&#8208;specific 17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins. Using a common bacterial expression system and with a 30&#8208;minute rapid synthesis protocol of 17O&#8208;labeled amino acids via mechanochemical saponification, we have generated Leu&#8208; and Phe&#8208;specific 17O&#8208;labeled recombinant proteins derived from diverse organisms, including CrgA and FtsQ from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and E protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus, demonstrating the applicability of our technique for amino acids known to be isotopically labeled without scrambling. We have acquired magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning 17O&#8197;NMR of these proteins to confirm the successful 17O labeling and illustrate the sensitivity of 17O&#8197;NMR to the protein's local structural environments. Our work significantly broadens the accessibility of 17O&#8208;NMR, empowering researchers to delve deeper into protein biophysics and biochemistry. This approach opens new avenues for understanding cellular processes at the molecular level by providing an effective tool for investigating oxygen&#8208;related interactions and chemistry within biomolecules.

         <title>Design Concepts of High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy materials, with their unique atomic structures and uniform distribution of multiple elements, enable flexible choices in composition and electronic structure, attracting significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion battery systems. This paper reviews the latest design strategies for high&#8208;entropy materials in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, offering potential solutions for efficient battery material development.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as strong candidates for replacing Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the large electrostatic repulsion between the cathode and Zn2+, the irreversible growth of zinc dendrites at the anode, and the hydrogen precipitation side reaction in the aqueous electrolyte have hindered the practical application of zinc ion batteries. Fortunately, the emergence of the revolutionary concept of high entropy has provided new opportunities for the development of battery materials. High&#8208;entropy materials, with their unique atomic structures and uniform distribution of multiple elements, offer flexible options for material compositions and electronic structures, thus attracting significant attention in battery systems. In this concept article, we summarize the definitions and intrinsic structural characteristics of high&#8208;entropy materials and provide a detailed overview of the latest design concepts from the perspectives of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Finally, we outline the challenges faced by high&#8208;entropy materials and potential solutions to guide researchers in developing efficient and stable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Quadruple Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behaviour of Acylhydrazone Crystals: Mechanical, Photomechanical, Thermomechanical, and Optical Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acicular crystal, BBFH, with quadruple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour that can undergo mechanical bending, phoptomechanical effects, thermomechanical responses and optical waveguide behaviour has been prepared.







Abstract
As society advances, the demand for high&#8208;performance crystal materials with versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities has increased. However, there remains a notable shortage of simple molecular crystals that exhibit stable and swift responses to various stimuli. In this study, we synthesized a novel acylhydrazone crystal by integrating benzene&#8208;fused heterocycles and halogens, achieving a crystal material with multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviours. The crystal demonstrates good mechanical flexibility, capable of with standing a strain of 2.3&#8201;% under applying mechanical force and recovering its original shape after force removal. Crystal structure analysis reveals this property is due to the strong and flexible intermolecular interactions. It also exhibits rapid photomechanical bending away from light source under UV irradiation, which could be attributed to the facile photoisomerization. Moreover, the crystal undergoes significant thermomechanical transitions, including cracking and jumping, upon heating. Additionally, the prepared crystal exhibits passive optical waveguide of red light at 640&#8197;nm, which, combining the photomechanical bending, can achieve controllable light output direction. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors make the acylhydrazone crystal a promising candidate for applications in multifunctional sensors, optoelectronic devices, and thermal switches. This work provides a helpful reference for the study of potential crystal material design and functionality of advanced responsive systems.

         <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Enhancement of Biofuel Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power output of a model biofuel cell can be improved when placing a magnet with moderate strength behind the electrodes. This, at first sight, counterintuitive parallel arrangement of the magnetic and electric field vectors still induces a significant Lorentz force at the edges of the electrodes, leading to a performance enhancement of up to 300&#8201;%.







Abstract
Biofuel cells have become an interesting alternative for the design of sustainable energy conversion systems with multiple applications ranging from biosensing and bioelectronics to autonomously moving devices. However, as an electrochemical system, their performance is intimately related to mass transport conditions. In this work, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect is studied as an easy and straightforward alternative to enhance the performance of a biofuel cell based on the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD). The synergetic effect between the electric and ionic currents, produced by the enzymatic redox reactions, and a magnetic field orthogonal to the surface of the electrodes, leads to the formation of localized magnetohydrodynamic vortexes. Such an integrated convective regime generates an increase of the bioelectrocatalytic current and its concomitant power output in the presence of the external magnetic field. In addition, by fine&#8208;tuning the spatial arrangement of the anode and cathode, it is possible to benefit from the sum of anodic and cathodic MHD vortexes, leading to an enhanced power output of up to 300&#8201;%.

         <title>TiO2&#8208;Phase&#8208;Mediated Size Effect of Rh Nanoparticles on Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective regulation of Rh nanoparticle size by crystal phase engineering of TiO2 facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the surface of catalysts, resulting in excellent CO2 hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation on TiO2&#8208;based catalysts has drawn extensive attention. However, few reports have focused on the impact of particle size of the active sites by altering TiO2 crystal phase on the CO2 hydrogenation activity. Herein, we successfully regulated Rh nanoparticle size by adjusting the crystal phases of TiO2 at different calcination temperatures and obtained impressive photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation performance. Notably, the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 loaded with Rh nanoparticles achieved a CH4 production rate of 2.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and a single&#8208;pass CO2 conversion rate of 69.4&#8201;%. Given the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 is more favorable for the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the distribution of Rh cations, Rh nanoparticles on the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 exhibited the smallest sizes. Small Rh particle size further enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation performance. Furthermore, the optimized Rh nanoparticle&#8208;loaded anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 catalyst exhibited high structural stability and resistance to coke accumulation, maintaining stability during long&#8208;term performance tests. This work investigated the particle size effect of active sites adjusted by crystal phase of light&#8208;harvesting materials on the photothermal catalytic performance, providing guidance for the preparation of effective catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4.

However, few reports have focused on the impact of particle size of the active sites by altering TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystal phase on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation activity. Herein, we successfully regulated Rh nanoparticle size by adjusting the crystal phases of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at different calcination temperatures and obtained impressive photothermal catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation performance. Notably, the anatase-phase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loaded with Rh nanoparticles achieved a CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and a single-pass CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate of 69.4&#8201;%. Given the anatase-phase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is more favorable for the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the distribution of Rh cations, Rh nanoparticles on the anatase-phase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited the smallest sizes. Small Rh particle size further enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation, leading to high photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation performance. Furthermore, the optimized Rh nanoparticle-loaded anatase-phase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited high structural stability and resistance to coke accumulation, maintaining stability during long-term performance tests. This work investigated the particle size effect of active sites adjusted by crystal phase of light-harvesting materials on the photothermal catalytic performance, providing guidance for the preparation of effective catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 4&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; Disubstituted CinNapht Dyes Accessible through Double SNAr Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 4&#8242;, 5&#8242; di&#8208;substituted CinNapht dyes is reported. Two new families have been obtained using either double addition of aromatic amines or addition of inner di&#8208;nucleophiles. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores have been investigated and rationalized thanks to DFT and TD/DFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used in live cell imaging experiments







Abstract
This article describes the synthesis of a difluorinated CinNapht derivative in the 4&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions allowing the easy access to two new families of fluorophores by late&#8208;stage functionalization using SNAr. The first one comprises derivatives incorporating hindered aromatic amines in the 4&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions, which show red&#8208;emission in apolar solvents. The second one is obtained through the use of dinucleophiles. Among them, Tetrahydroquinoxaline (THQ) and tetrahydrobenzodiazepine (THB) compounds show strongly redshifted emission. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores in these two families are studied and rationalized by DFT and TDDFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used to image living cells by confocal microscopy.

         <title>A Water Channel&#8208;like Structure Self&#8208;Assembled by Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As artificial water channels have received widespread attention, various types of artificial water channels have been reported. However, apart from I&#8208;quartet channels, the development of 1D water channels with water wires constructed from small molecules has rarely been reported, because of the difficulty in precisely tuning the dipolar water molecules. Inspired by G&#8208;quartet functionalization strategies, this study explored C8 modifications of our previously reported molecule, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2'&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), known for its strong hydration properties and self&#8208;assembly capabilities, and investigated its potential for constructing nucleoside&#8208;based water channel&#8208;like structures. Among all derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2'&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;adenosine can form an S&#8208;shaped channel as a tetramer, incorporating water wire arrays in the solid state. Such water channel&#8208;like structures in nucleoside self&#8208;assemblies provide new insights into the development of novel nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular water channel materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly selective cytokine induction of nitrated lipid&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;GalCer derivatives demonstrating high binding affinity to the lipid antigen presenting molecule CD1d</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycolipid antigens are presented by CD1d on antigen&#8208;presenting cells to T cell receptors (TCRs) of natural killar (NK)T cells, leading to immune responses via cytokine induction. Although various lipid antigens have been found, there are only limited numbers of glycolipid antigens having selective cytokine induction. In this study, we identified the glycolipids (&#945;&#8208;GalCer nitro&#8208;type) that exhibits highly selective induction of Th2 and Th17 type cytokine, with very high binding affinity to CD1d, by introducing natural nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups. The natural nitroalkene moiety of fatty acyl groups in the glycolipids effectively enhance the affinity to CD1d with presumed hydrogen&#8208;bonding and cation&#8211;&#960;&#160;interaction, leading to the distinctive function in cytokine induction and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Superior Ionic Conducting Plastic Crystal Near Room Temperature with Electrical Bistability and Magnetic Transition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion plastic crystal exhibits superionic conduction near room temperature, and the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in bistability in both magnetic and electric properties.







Abstract
Multifunctional ionic plastic crystals (IPCs) are a class of unique materials that exhibit a wide range of advanced applications. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the design of multifunctional, superior ion&#8208;conducting IPCs with bistability in both magnetic and electric properties, moreover, we successfully prepared and thoroughly characterized such an IPC, [PMPyr][Ni(mnt)2] (1; PMPyr+=N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium, and mnt2&#8722;=maleonitriledithiolate). Plastic crystal 1 exhibits superior ion conduction near room temperature, and its ion conductivity reaches the order of 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 373&#8197;K. Remarkably, the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in 1 simultaneously exhibiting electrical bistability and magnetic transition. Our study paves the way for the development of new IPCs with desirable functional properties.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF)&#8208;Based Sensors for Mercury (Hg) Detection: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work summarizes the advances of MOFs sensors for Hg and the main MOFs are UIO, ZIF, and MIL. Fluorescence and colorimetry are the two types of optical sensors for Hg. The recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups of MOFs. Portable devices like microfluidics and smartphones are developed to facilitate portability.







Abstract
Monitoring mercury (Hg) is critical for environmental and public health. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based sensors demonstrate the advantage of high sensitivity and rapid response. We summarize the advances of MOF sensors for Hg2+ detection from the perspective of MOF type and role in the sensors. First, we introduce three MOFs used in Hg sensors&#8208;UIO, ZIF, and MIL&#8208;that have demonstrated superior performance.

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational freedom. Porcine odorant binding protein mimics the gas phase environment of carvone by lowering the energy barrier of interconversion between different conformational states. A multi&#8208;scale computational approach reveals the driving force that allows OBPs to facilitate the transport of hydrophobic odorants through the hydrophilic mucus.







Abstract
Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.

         <title>Impact of Dihedral Angle in Conjugated Organic Cation on the Structures and Properties of Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihedral angle inside the organic cation significantly change the crystal packing as&#8208;well&#8208;as optical property of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs). We used N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinium cation (iodide counter&#8208;ion) for the synthesis of HOIMHs. The change in dihedral angle of the organic cation gives two different hybrid crystal with different optical property.







Abstract
Conjugated organic cations are intriguing for organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites due to their direct participation in the optoelectronic properties of hybrid materials. In conjugated cations, the dihedral angle, or torsion angle, between adjacent aromatic rings is a critical secondary structural element. This angle influences not only the shape of the cations but also the overlap between the &#960;&#8208;orbitals on adjacent rings, thereby affecting their electronic properties. Understanding how variations in the dihedral angle impact the structure and properties of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs) is fundamentally important. In this study, we utilized 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl bipyridinium as the organic cation, reacting it with PbI&#8322; to form hybrid lead iodides. Remarkably, variations in the dihedral angle between the two pyridinium rings resulted in the formation of two distinct crystal structures with different band gaps. Our findings demonstrate that manipulating the dihedral angle offers a novel approach to controlling the structures and properties of hybrid metal halides with conjugated cations.

         <title>Olikomycin A&#8211;A Novel Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide with Antibiotic Activity Against Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deletion of pleiotropic regulatory gene wblA in S. ghanaensis ATCC 14672 activated a novel biosynthetic gene cluster, producing Olikomycin A, a cyclic lipopeptide synthesized by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases. In the presence of calcium, it shows promising activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, inducing cell death by disrupting cell membrane integrity through a yet unknown mechanism.







Abstract
Research into new antibiotics is becoming increasingly important as antibiotic resistance increases worldwide. The genus Streptomyces in particular is able to produce a wide range of antimicrobial products due to the large number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in its genome. However, not all BGCs are expressed under laboratory conditions. In this work, deletion of the gene wblA, encoding a global regulator of natural product biosynthesis and morphogenesis in Streptomyces, led to the production of a novel natural product, olikomycin A, in Streptomyces ghanaensis ATCC 14672. Complete structure elucidation revealed that olikomycin A belongs to a class of calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics known as non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)&#8208;encoded acidic lipopeptides. These compounds exhibit remarkable antimicrobial activity in the presence of calcium. Insights into olikomycin A biosynthesis were provided by whole genome sequencing and gene inactivation studies, while bioactivity assays showed strong inhibition of the growth of multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens via disrupting cell membrane integrity. Olikomycin A shows an antibiotic profile similar to that of daptomycin, which is already in clinical use.

         <title>Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products based on M&#8208;SACs/Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of C2+ products characterized by enhanced energy density. The limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single&#8208;component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial&#8208;scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO pathway using metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs), etc., with the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion on Cu species, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M&#8208;SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems. The systematic analysis of the design principles and  structure&#8208;activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem system, encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8208;N&#8208;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.</dc:description>

Mushroom is a rich source of ligninolytic and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore was consider as promising biocatalysts for organic synthesis. This review focused on the broad utilization potential of the mushroom-based biocatalysts and highlights key advances in mushroom-mediated organic transformations. It mainly includes reduction of ketone and carboxylic acids, hydroxylation of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, epoxidation of olefin, oxidative cleavage of alkene, and other uncommon reactions catalyzed by the whole-cells or purified enzymes of mushroom-origin. Overall, a comprehensive overview of the applications of mushroom as biocatalyst in organic synthesis is provided, which puts this versatile microorganism in the spotlight of further research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH Controlled transient cyclization of peptides for increased stability towards oral delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides are highly efficient for treatment of many diseases, especially in oncology and diabetes. Oral delivery of peptides is desirable, but is challenged by low bioavailability and new chemical methods to enable oral delivery are needed. Here, we developed pH responsive linearization as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH to form the active peptide. We developed ester based responsive linkers with a protonable amine for O&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift, which allowed linearization strategies based on pyroglutamoyl (pGlu) or diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. After coupling of the linker, peptides were cyclized by CuAAC. We studied the stability against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at different pH and the ability of cyclic peptides to linearize. This led to PYY3&#8208;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thiazolidinedione&#8208; and Triazole&#8208;Linked Organoselenocyanates and Evaluation of Anticancer Activities Against Breast Cancer with Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoselenocyanates are important classes of organoselenium compounds having potential pharmaceutical applications in cancer biology. In the present study, two different series of organoselenocyanates (15a&#8208;15c and 16a&#8208;16c) incorporating crucial heterocyclic pharmacophores such as 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole were rationally designed. The organoselenocyanates were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis and investigated for their anticancer activities against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Based on the preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative activities and the selectivity index towards cancer cells over the normal cells, 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;based selenocyanate 15a was identified as the lead analogue for detailed investigations. In addition to the anti&#8208;migratory activity, compound 15a induced G1&#8208;phase arrest of the cell cycle and led to early apoptosis. Further studies on the redox balance of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells indicated the antioxidant nature of 15a with the quenching of ROS level and upregulation of TrxR1 expression. Detailed mechanistic investigations with the expression levels of key&#8208;cancer marker proteins revealed that the selenocyanate 15a induced the activation of ERK pathway by upregulating p&#8208;ERK expression with the subsequent downregulation of p&#8208;Akt and c&#8208;Myc levels leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Therefore, the primary outcomes of the study would be valuable in the development of chemotherapeutic agents towards the treatment of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.</dc:description>

In addition to the anti-migratory activity, compound 15a induced G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle and led to early apoptosis. Further studies on the redox balance of MDA-MB-231 cells indicated the antioxidant nature of 15a with the quenching of ROS level and upregulation of TrxR1 expression.

         <title>Economically Scalable Cu&#8208;based MOFs: Vital Role of Structural Integrity towards Selectivity on Azeotropic Ethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile, green, and economical method for the scalable synthesis of hydrophilic copper&#8208;triazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;trz) is demonstrated. Numerous open metal sites within the highly crystalline porous structure of Cu&#8208;trz are generated through mild thermal activation, enabling its application in liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration under ambient conditions. The frameworks with distinct crystallinity and particle sizes were achieved by modifying the synthesis process. The high crystallinity of the framework plays an exclusive role in enhancing water adsorption capacity. With selective water adsorption comparable to commercial zeolite 3A, Cu&#8208;trz MOF emerges as a promising candidate for cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;ethanol separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable Iron&#8208;Copper Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Primary Amides with Aryl and Alkyl Halides: Access to N&#8208;Arylamides as Potential Antibacterial and Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present, for the first time, an efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol successfully yielded the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities (including heterocycles). No conventional work&#8208;up is required for this protocol, and the developed method is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Notably, the catalyst is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and can be reused at least four times with minimal loss of catalytic activity. A series of experiments, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to identify the oxidation state of active catalytic species and radical clock experiment was performed using a radical probe to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluated the antibacterial and anticancer properties of selected synthesized products (3ii, 3xii, and 3xxxx) in&#8208;vitro. The results indicated that the prepared compounds exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we simultaneously synthesized three different double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes including the asymmetric BNNY and BNNO and the mirror&#8208;symmetric BNNR, via a one&#8208;pot method. The annulation modes of the B&#8592;N Lewis pairs and the substituents on the boron atoms efficiently tune the molecular frontier orbitals and emission colors. &#945;&#8208;Position fusion leads to a significant enhancement of the HOMO energy level and a decrease in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups attached to the boron atom make the LUMO energy level more stable. In particular, the LUMO energy level of BNNO is as low as &#8208;3.12 eV. BNNY, BNNO, and BNNR emit cyan, green, and red fluorescence at 509, 534, and 620 nm, respectively, with fluorescence quantum yields of 24%, 49%, and 30%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A {Cr4Ln2} Complex with Exchange Coupled {Cr2} Units: Structural Description and Magnetic Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have prepared and structurally characterized pivalate based {CrIII4LnIII2} complexes with Ln=Dy and Gd as well as the Y analogue, with the overall formula  [CrIII4LnIII2(mdea)2(piv)10(OH)4], Ln= Gd, Dy and Y. We are reporting a detailed experimental magnetic properties study, including magnetization relaxation dynamics and calorimetric data, supported with quantum chemical calculations.  The synthesis of the Y derivative, allowed to precisely identify the Cr(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange interaction magnitude which proved moderately strong and in agreement with known magneto&#8208;structural correlations. &#160;This result agrees with the observed double bridged {Cr2&#8208;mOH&#8208;mOR} units within the {Cr4Ln2} complexes.The Gd(III) complex magnetic properties can be properly described with the already established exchange coupled {Cr2} units, and a unique Gd(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange coupling parameter which proved anti&#8208;ferromagnetic in nature.The MCE characterization of this complexbased on magnetization and calorimetric data down to 2 K affords a moderate entropy change value, mainly affected by the strong Cr&#8208;Cr exchange interaction.The complex with Ln=Dy, showed SMM behaviour below 10 K under 0 DC applied field with negligible field dependence up to 3000 Oe and 10 kHz of AC field frequency. Two relaxation processes are clearly distinguished, with thermal barriers for an Orbach mechanism of ca. 20 cm&#8208;1 and 40 cm&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure Macrocycles Based on Tr&#246;ger's Base and Diphenyl Maleimide Exhibiting Strong Chiral Emission and Host&#8208;guest Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While a plenty of macrocyclic hosts have been developed in supramolecular chemistry, those that combine chiral luminescent properties and host&#8208;guest recognition abilities are still uncommon. Herein, two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization reactions using Tr&#246;ger's base and diphenyl maleimide as the building blocks. The diphenyl maleimide units impart these macrocycles with highly strong fluorescence, achieving quantum yields up to 100% in apolar solvents. Furthermore, the chiral, V&#8208;shaped Tr&#246;ger's base units provide the macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| = 1.68 &#215; 10&#8722;3) and well&#8208;define cavity for hosting electron&#8208;deficient or positively charged guests with Ka up to 1.7 &#215; 106 M&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Multinuclear Alkali Metallated (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) Family of the 1,3,5&#8208;Tris&#8208;2&#8208;aminopyridyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene Framework</title>

         <dc:description>Literature on Group One organoelement chemistry is dominated by lithium, though sodium and potassium also feature prominently, whereas rubidium and caesium are rarely mentioned. With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi&#8208;alkali&#8208;metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5&#8208;tris[(4,6&#8208;dimethylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)aminomethyl]&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N&#8208;H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF&#8208;solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un&#8208;metallated N&#8208;H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium&#8208;tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li&#8208;Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali&#8208;metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.</dc:description>

With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi-alkali-metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5-tris[(4,6-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)aminomethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N-H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF-solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un-metallated N-H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium-tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li-Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali-metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PCET&#8208;driven Reactivity of Neptunyl(VI) Yields Oxo&#8208;bridged Np(V) and Np(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two unconventional polynuclear complexes of neptunium(Np) featuring mono&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;oxo motifs have been accessed by proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactivity involving the dissolution of neptunyl(VI) diacetate dihydrate (NpO2(OAc)2 (H2O)2&#8226;HOAc) in methanol followed by addition of a pentadentate Schiff&#8208;base ligand. One complex is a mixed&#8208;valent [NpV,NpIV,NpV] trimer with two bridging &#956;2&#8208;oxos and the other is a [NpV,NpV] dimer featuring a single &#956;2&#8208;oxo. In both complexes the outer Np centers are capped with terminal oxo ligands. Spectroscopic and spectrokinetic studies aimed at elucidating mechanistic details of complex formation in this system show that intermediate multinuclear [NpV O2(OAc)]n species form prior to metal chelation by the ligand; electrolysis experiments demonstrate that production of Np(V) gives rise to asynchronous proton transfer that does not occur otherwise (in the Np(VI) state) as well as condensation with loss of H2O and formation of the polynuclear complexes. We attribute the oxo&#8208;deficient nature of these products, with respect to conventional actinyl ([AnO2]m+) species, to the reduction/condensation reaction sequence of PCET.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered Assembly of Natural Phenolic Building Blocks for Supramolecular Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids in nature are constructed by 'bottom&#8208;up' assembly with diverse functions and structural ordered characteristics. Supramolecular assemblies have been employed to mimic the natural complexity by manipulating the subtle variations of functional groups. Nevertheless, the intricate design of the driving forces or sophisticated synthesis of molecular skeletons poses challenges in fabricating highly ordered assemblies. Natural phenolic molecules with anisotropic functional groups exhibit potential as versatile building blocks for a wide range of supramolecular crystalline materials with tailored assembly and controlled functionalities. The inherent and anisotropic phenolic groups engage in ordered assembly with various materials via directional covalent bonds (e.g., condensation and coordination) as well as multiple molecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions), leading to the formation of supramolecular crystalline materials with diverse functionalities. This Concept presents the assembly mechanisms of crystalline phenolic materials and their applications, showcasing the effective utilization of ordered assembly by natural phenolic building blocks.</dc:description>
