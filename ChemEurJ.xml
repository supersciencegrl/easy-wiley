      <dc:description>Reported here is the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly characterization of [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  , &#160;n = 2, 3) equipped with anilide hydrogen bonding units. These molecules differ from previous self&#8208;assembling [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  ) in the connectivity of their amide hydrogen bonding units (  C  &#8208;centered/carboxamide vs.  N  &#8208;centered/anilide). This subtle change results in a ~30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation constant for the  [2.2]pCp  &#8208;4,7,12,15&#8208;tetraanilide (  [2.2]pCpNTA  ) compared to previously reported  [2.2]pCp  &#8208;4,7,12,15&#8208;tetracarboxamide (  [2.2]pCpTA  ), and a ~300&#8208;fold increase in the elongation constant for the  [3.3]pCp  &#8208;5,8,14,17&#8208;tetraanilide (  [3.3]pCpNTA  ) compared to previously reported  [3.3]pCp  &#8208;5,8,14,17&#8208;tetracarboxamide (  [3.3]pCpTA  ). The  [n.n]pCpNTA  monomers also represent the reversal of a previously reported trend in solution&#8208;phase assembly strength when comparing  [2.2]pCpTA  and  [3.3]pCpTA  monomers. The origins of the assembly differences are geometric changes in the association between  [n.n]pCpNTA  monomers&#8212;revealed by computations and X&#8208;ray crystallography&#8212;resulting in a more favorable slipped stacking of the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;surfaces (  [n.n]pCpNTA  vs.  [n.n]pCpTA  ), and a more complementary H&#8208;bonding geometry (  [3.3]pCpNTA  vs.  [2.2]pCpNTA  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral oligothiophenes with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence and electroluminescence in thin films</title>
      <dc:description>We report circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in thin films of self&#8208;organized oligothiophenes. Four new 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based oligothiophenes were ad hoc designed to ensure efficient spontaneous formation of chiral supramolecular order. They were easily synthetized and their chiroptical properties in thin films were measured. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra revealed glum in the order of 10&#8208;2 on a wide wavelengths range, originating from their self&#8208;organized chiral supramolecular organization. These molecules have reasonable properties as organic semiconductors and for this reason they can constitute the active layer of circularlypolarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Thus, we could investigate directly their electroluminescence (EL) and CPEL, without resorting to blends, but rather in a simple multilayer device with basic architecture.

      <title>Enhanced polysulfides adsorptions on CNTs/Boron Nitride fibers for excellent Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage system. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries.

This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes delivered a high initial capacity of 1222 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C. Upon increasing the current density of 4 C, the cell retained a capacity of 482 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044% per cycle.

      <title>What determines the selectivity of arginine dihydroxylation by the nonheme iron enzyme OrfP?</title>
      <dc:description>The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with L&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3  R  ,4  R  &#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of L&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C  3  &#8208;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C  3  &#8210;H and C  4  &#8210;H bond strengths of L&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C  3  &#8210;H activation to a low&#8208;energy  5  s&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C  4  &#8210;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying  5  p&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Lanthanoid Complexes as Molecular Materials: The Redox Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The development of molecular materials with novel functionality offers promise for technological innovation.

Lanthanoid metals are most prevalent in their trivalent state and usually redox&#8208;activity in lanthanoid complexes is restricted to the ligand.

      <title>Efficient Emission of Ultraviolet Light by Solid State Organic Fluorophores: Synthesis and Characterization of 1,4&#8208;Dialkeny&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;benzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes were readily prepared in three steps from 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetylbenzene or 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diformylbenzene and via two to four steps from 1,4&#8208;bis(diethoxyphosphonylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene. The dial&#8208;kenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (  &#955;  em  = 350&#8211;387 nm) and in the solid state (  &#955;  em  = 328&#8211;388 nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (  &#934;  = 0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adaman&#8208;tylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (  &#934;  = 0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxy&#8208;benzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted  &#960;  &#8208;system to the phenyl&#8211;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.</dc:description>

The dial&#8208;kenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (  &#955;  em  = 350&#8211;387 nm) and in the solid state (  &#955;  em  = 328&#8211;388 nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (  &#934;  = 0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adaman&#8208;tylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (  &#934;  = 0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxy&#8208;benzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted  &#960;  &#8208;system to the phenyl&#8211;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Computational Mapping of Dirhodium(II) Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The chemistry of dirhodium(II) catalysts is highly diverse, and can enable the synthesis of many different molecular classes. A tool to aid in catalyst selection, independent of mechanism and reactivity, would therefore be highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of a database for dirhodium(II) catalysts that is based on the principal component analysis of DFT&#8208;calculated parameters capturing their steric and electronic properties. This database maps the relevant catalyst space, and may facilitate exploration of the reactivity landscape for any process catalysed by dirhodium(II) complexes. We have shown that one of the principal components of these catalysts correlates with the outcome (e.g. yield, selectivity) of a transformation used in a molecular discovery project. Furthermore, we envisage that this approach will assist the selection of more effective catalyst screening sets, and, hence, the data&#8208;led optimisation of a wide range of rhodium&#8208;catalysed transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Innovative Multipodal Ligands Derived from Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s Bases for the Sensitization of Lanthanide(III) Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of the first family of multipodal ligands with a Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework designed for the preparation of luminescent lanthanide(III) complexes. Eight ligands were designed and synthesized using different strategies, including alkylation reactions, amide couplings and Ugi multicomponent reactions. All ligands bear carboxylate groups for the coordination of the lanthanide(III) ion, with lanthanide(III) sensitizing units consisting of the Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework itself or attached benzamides. Upon irradiation of the chromophoric ligands, the green terbium(III) emission was efficiently generated, whereas the europium(III) emission signal was negligible. The geometry and the substitution pattern of the ligands allow the control of the stoichiometry of the species formed and the Tb(III) luminescence sensitization efficiency, showing that  para  &#8211;substitution patterns are more efficient than  meta  &#8211;substitution ones for the formation of coordination compounds with lower Tb(III)/ligand ratio. We propose that the formed species are self&#8211;assembled 2:2 or 2:4 metallosupramolecular structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting the Iodine Adsorption and Radioresistance of Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs via Aromatic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>Effective capture of radioactive iodine is of paramount importance for the safe and long&#8208;term storage of fission products in nuclear fuel cycle. Herein, a series of functionalized Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs was employed as a model to investigate the effects of substituents on iodine adsorption in both solution and vapor states. Sorption studies revealed that the electro&#8208;donating amino group exhibits the most positive role on increasing the removal rate of iodine from cyclohexane and the uptake capacity of iodine vapor. Particularly, the disubstituted Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2  can effectively remove 91.9% of iodine (300 mg/L) from cyclohexane and capture 969 mg/g iodine vapor, significantly higher than 59.6% and 334 mg/g of untagged Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, respectively. In addition, the substituent effect on the radiolytic stability of MOFs was for the first time investigated, leading to the unearthing of one of the most radioresistant MOFs Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  reported up to date.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;Photochromic Molecules Based on Dihydroazulene Units</title>
      <dc:description>
Switch back and forth: The switching properties of multi&#8208;photochromic molecules bearing two or three dihydroazulene (DHA) photoswitches can be fine&#8208;tuned by the nature of the bridging unit (azulene, thiophene, or benzene ring) separating the DHA moieties and by the substitution pattern of the DHA systems. (see figure, VHF=vinylheptafulvene)







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photochromic systems incorporating individually addressable switching units are attractive for development of advanced data storage devices. Here, we present the synthesis and properties of a selection of such molecular systems incorporating the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photo&#8208;/thermoswitch. The influence of the linker (meta&#8208;phenylene vs. azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl vs. thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) separating two DHA units on the switching properties was investigated. An azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl spacer largely inhibited both the DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerizations and the thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;reactions; the latter occurred ten times slower than for the related compound with a meta&#8208;phenylene spacer. A DHA trimer containing three DHA units around a central benzene ring was found to undergo stepwise DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerizations, whereas the thermal back&#8208;reactions occurred at similar rates for the three VHF entities. A meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged DHA dimer was subjected to further structural modifications at position C&#8208;1 of each DHA, having strong implications for the switching events, and synthetic steps for further functionalizations at position C&#8208;7 of each DHA were investigated. Finally, the molecular structure (from X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis) between the meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged DHA dimer and CuI is presented.

The influence of the linker (&lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene vs. azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl vs. thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) separating two DHA units on the switching properties was investigated. An azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl spacer largely inhibited both the DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerizations and the thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;reactions; the latter occurred ten times slower than for the related compound with a &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene spacer. A DHA trimer containing three DHA units around a central benzene ring was found to undergo stepwise DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerizations, whereas the thermal back&#8208;reactions occurred at similar rates for the three VHF entities. A &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged DHA dimer was subjected to further structural modifications at position C&#8208;1 of each DHA, having strong implications for the switching events, and synthetic steps for further functionalizations at position C&#8208;7 of each DHA were investigated. Finally, the molecular structure (from X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis) between the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged DHA dimer and Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural and Oxidation State Alternatives in Platinum and Palladium Complexes of a Redox&#8208;Active Amidinato Ligand</title>

The neutral compounds were characterized through experiments (crystal structures, electrochemistry, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy, magnetic resonance) and TD&#8208;DFT calculations as metal(II) species with noninnocent ligands L  &#8208;  . The reversibly accessible cations [PtL  2  ]  +  and [Pd  2  L  4  ]  +  were also studied, the latter as [Pd  2  L  4  ][B{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  4  ] single crystals. Experimental and computational investigations were directed at the elucidation of the electronic structures, establishing the correct oxidation states within the alternatives [Pt  II  (L  &#8208;  )  2  ] or [Pt  o  (L  &#8226;  )  2  ], [Pt  II  (L  0.5&#8208;  )  2  ]  +  or [Pt  III  (L  &#8208;  )  2  ]  +  , [(Pd  II  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  &#8208;  )  4  ] or [(Pd  1.5  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  0.75&#8208;  )  4  ], and [(Pd  2.5  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  &#8208;  )  4  ]  +  or [(Pd  II  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  0.75&#8208;  )  4  ]  +  . In each case, the first alternative was shown to be most appropriate. Remarkable results include the preference of platinum for mononuclear planar [PtL&#173;  2  ] with an N&#8208;Pt&#8208;N bite angle of 62.8(2)&#176; in contrast to [Pd  2  L  4  ], and the dimetal (Pd  2  4+  &#8594;Pd  2  5+  ) instead of ligand (L  &#8208;  &#8594;L  &#8226;  ) oxidation of the dinuclear palladium compound.</dc:description>

      <title>The application of HEXS and HERFD XANES for accurate structural characterization of actinide nanomaterials: application to ThO2.</title>
      <dc:description>Structural characterization of actinide nanoparticles (NPs) is of primary importance and hard to achieve, especially for non&#8208;homogeneous samples with NPs below 3 nm. By combining High Energy X&#8208;ray Scattering (HEXS) and High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Detected X&#8208;ray Near&#8208;Edge Structure (HERFD XANES), we characterized for the first time both short&#8208; and medium&#8208;range order of ThO  2  NPs obtained by chemical precipitation. With this methodology, a novel insight into the structure of NPs at different steps of their formation process is achieved. The Pair Distribution Function (PDF) reveals a high concentration of ThO  2  small units similar to Th hexamer clusters mixed with 1 nm ThO  2  NPs in the initial steps of formation. Drying the precipitates at &#8275;150 &#176;C promotes recrystallization of the smallest units into more thermodynamically stable ThO  2  NPs. HERFD XANES at Th M  4  edge, a direct probe of the f states, shows variations that we correlate to the break of the local symmetry around Th atoms, which most likely concerns surface atoms. Together, HEXS and HERFD are a powerful methodology to investigate actinide NPs and their formation mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Galectin&#8208;Glycan Interaction: Guideline for Monitoring by 77Se NMR Spectroscopy and Solvent (H2O/D2O) Impact on Binding</title>
      <dc:description>Functional pairing between cellular glyco&#173;con&#173;ju&#173;gates and tissue lectins like galectins has wide (patho)physio&#173;logical significance. Their study is facilitated by non&#8208;hydrolyzable deri&#173;va&#173;tives of the natural O&#8208;glycans, such as S&#8208; and Se&#8208;glycosides. The latter en&#173;able extensive analyses by specific  77  Se NMR spectroscopy, but still remain under&#173;explored. By the example of seleno&#173;&#173;digalac&#173;to&#173;side (SeDG) and the human galectins 1 and 3, we evaluate diverse  77  Se NMR detec&#173;tion methods and pro&#173;pose selec&#173;tive  1  H,  77  Se hetero&#173;nuclear Hartmann&#8208;Hahn transfer for efficient use in com&#173;peti&#173;tive NMR screening against a seleno&#173;glycoside spy ligand. By fluores&#173;cence aniso&#173;tropy, circular dichroism, and isothermal titra&#173;tion calori&#173;metry (ITC) we show that affinity and thermodynamics of SeDG bind&#173;ing by galectins are similar to thiodi&#173;galac&#173;toside (TDG) and N&#8208;acetyl&#173;lactos&#173;amine (LacNAc), con&#173;firm&#173;ing that Se substitution has no major impact. ITC data in D  2  O vs. H  2  O are similar for TDG and LacNAc binding by both galectins, but a solvent effect, indicating solvent rearrangement at the binding site, is hinted for SeDG and clearly observed for LacNAc dimers with extend&#173;ed chain length.</dc:description>

      <title>PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS Block Copolymer Templated Mesoporous Carbons: A Comparative Study of Nitrogen and Sulfur Doping in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon materials slightly doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen (N&#8208;RFC) or sulfur (S&#8208;RFC) are investigated as active catalysts for the electrochemical bioelectronic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H  2  O  2  . Mesoporous carbons with wide, accessible pores were prepared by pyrolysis of a resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resin using a PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS block copolymer as a sacrificial templating agent and the nitrogen and sulfur doping were accomplished in a second thermal treatment employing 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and dibenzothiophene as nitrogen and sulfur precursors, respectively. The synthetic strategy allowed to obtain carbon materials with very high surface area and mesopore volume without any further physico&#8208;chemical post treatment.
Voltammetric rotating ring&#8208;disk measurements in combination with potentiostatic and galvanostatic bulk electrolysis measurements in 0.5 M H  2  SO  4  demonstrated a pronounced effect of heteroatom doping and mesopores volume on the catalytic activity and selectivity for H  2  O  2  .

The undoped carbon RFC showed a lower production rate (218 mM&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  ) but a higher FE of 76 %, while the performances drastically dropped when S&#8208;RFC (production rate 11 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  and FE = 39 %) was used.</dc:description>

Moreover, it was also demonstrated that the intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,7&#8208;enynes &#8208; after fragmentation of the cyclobutane ring &#8208; leads to enyne&#8208;metathesis&#8208;like products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Linker Hydrophilicity Modulates the Anticancer Activity of RGD&#8208;Cryptophycin Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Most anticancer agents are hydrophobic and can easily penetrate the tumor cell membrane by passive diffusion.

A hydrophilic &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase&#8208;cleavable linker was used to connect the highly potent antimitotic agent cryptophycin&#8208;55 glycinate with the &#945;v&#946;3 integrin ligand c(RGDfK).

      <title>How does iron storage protein ferritin interact with plutonium (and thorium) ?</title>
      <dc:description>The impact of the contamination of living organisms by actinide elements has been a constant subject of attention since the 1950s. But to date still little is understood. Ferritin is the major storage and regulation protein of iron in many organisms, it consists of a protein ring and a ferrihydric core at the center. This work sheds light on the interactions of early actinides (Th, Pu) at oxidation state +IV with ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH compared to Fe.&#160;
The Ferritin &#8208; thorium load curve suggests that Th(IV) saturates the protein (2840 Th atoms per ferritin) in a similar way that Fe does on the protein ring. Complementary spectroscopic techniques (Spectrophotometry, Infrared Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy) were combined with Molecular Dynamics to provide a structural model of the interaction of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) with ferritin. Comparison of spectroscopic data together with MD calculations suggests that Th(IV) and Pu(IV) are complexed mainly on the protein ring and not on the ferrihydric core. Indeed from XAS data, there is no evidence of Fe neighbors in the Th and Pu environments. On the other hand, carboxylates from amino acids of the protein ring and a possible additional carbonate anion are shaping the cation coordination spheres. This thorough description from a molecular view point of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) interaction with ferritin, an essential iron storage protein, is a cornerstone in comprehensive nuclear toxicology</dc:description>

      <title>Implanting Atomic Dispersed Ru in PtNi Colloidal Nanocrystal Clusters for Efficient Catalytic Performance in Electro&#8208;oxidation of Liquid Fuels</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the fact that PtRu alloy nanocatalyst has been certified to possess the excellent electrocatalytic performance and CO&#8208;poisoning tolerance toward the formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation, the unaffordable usages of ruthenium (Ru) and platinum (Pt) have greatly limited their widespread adoption. Here, we report a facile one&#8208;pot method to implant atomic dispersed Ru in PtNi colloidal nanocrystal clusters with different Ru/Pt/Ni molar ratios, which highly reduces the dosages of Pt and Ru, and further improves their catalytic performances for the electro&#8208;oxidation of formic acid and methanol. By simply controlling the amount of Ni(acac)2 precursor,&#160;trimetallic Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2, Ru0.6Pt55.9Ni43.5,&#160;Ru0.2Pt77.3Ni22.5&#160;and Ru0.9Pt27.3Ni71.8&#160;CNCs are obtained. Particularly, the Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2&#160;CNCs&#160;exhibit the excellent specific activities for formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation, 14.2&#8211; and 15.3&#8211;fold higher than those of Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Moreover, the Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2&#160;CNCs&#160;also possess better anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning property&#160;and superior diffusion ability than those of other RuPtNi CNCs.&#160;The excellent formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation activities of RuPtNi CNCs&#160;are ascribed&#160;to the optimal ligand effects derived from the Pt, Ni and atomic dispersed Ru atoms, which can improve OH adsorption ability and further anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning capability.&#160;This research opens up a new door for increasing the electro&#8208;oxidation properties of liquid fuels by using the less dosages of noble metal in Pt&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Stable, Readily Reducible, Fluorescent, Trifluoromethylated 9&#8208;Borafluorenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Having your cake and eating it too: Functionalization of 9&#8208;borafluorenes with trifluoromethyl groups makes them exceptionally easy to reduce while maintaining excellent stability towards hydrolysis. The systems also exhibit long&#8208;lived fluorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) depending on the exo&#8208;aryl para&#8208;substituent.







Abstract
Three different perfluoroalkylated borafluorenes (FBf) were prepared and their electronic and photophysical properties were investigated. The systems have four trifluoromethyl moieties on the borafluorene moiety as well as two trifluoromethyl groups at the ortho positions of their exo&#8208;aryl moieties. They differ with regard to the para substituents on their exo&#8208;aryl moieties, being a proton (FXylFBf, FXyl: 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), a trifluoromethyl group (FMesFBf, FMes: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) or a dimethylamino group (p&#8208;NMe2&#8208;FXylFBf, p&#8208;NMe2&#8208;FXyl: 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), respectively. All derivatives exhibit extraordinarily low reduction potentials, comparable to those of perylenediimides. The most electron&#8208;deficient derivative FMesFBf was also chemically reduced and its radical anion isolated and characterized. Furthermore, all compounds exhibit very long fluorescent lifetimes of about 250&#8197;ns up to 1.6&#8197;&#956;s; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this differ. The donor&#8208;substituted derivative p&#8208;NMe2&#8208;FXylFBf exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state, whereas the FMesFBf and FXylFBf borafluorenes exhibit only weakly allowed locally excited (LE) transitions due to their symmetry and low transition&#8208;dipole moments.

&lt;b&gt;Mes&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;Bf&lt;/b&gt; was also chemically reduced and its radical anion isolated and characterized.

      <title>Synthesis of Low&#8208;Valent Dinuclear Group 14 Compounds with Element&#8208;Element Bonds by Transylidation</title>
      <dc:description>Dinuclear low&#8208;valent compounds of the heavy main group elements are rare species owing to their intrinsic reactivity. However, they represent desirable target molecules due to their unusual bonding situations as well as applications in bond activations and materials synthesis. The isolation of such compounds usually requires the use of substituents that provide sufficient stability and synthetic access. Here we report on the use of strongly donating ylide&#8208;substituents to access low&#8208;valent dinuclear group 14 com&#173;pounds. The ylides not only impart steric and electronic stabilization, but also allow facile synthesis via transfer of an ylide from tetrylene precursors of type  R  Y  2  E to ECl2 (E = Ge, Sn; Y = TolSO  2  (PR  3  )C with R = Ph, Cy). This method allowed the isolation of dinuclear complexes amongst a germanium analogue of a vinyl cation, [(  Ph  Y)  2  GeGe(  Ph  Y)]+ with an electronic struc&#173;ture best described as a germylene&#8208;stabilized Ge(II) cation and a ylide(chloro)&#173;digermene [  Ph  Y(Cl)GeGe(Cl)  Ph  Y] with an unusually unsymmetrical structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Evaluation of Pd&#8594;B Interactions in Diphosphinoborane Complexes and Impact on Inner&#8208;Sphere Reductive Elimination</title>
      <dc:description>
Ligand effects: The borane acceptor in diphosphinoborane ligands discriminates between the oxidation state PdII and Pd0, stabilizing the latter. The impact of the Pd&#8594;B interaction on inner&#8208;sphere C&#8722;N bond reductive elimination of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitroaniline was investigated (see scheme).







Abstract
The dative Pd&#8594;B interaction in a series of RDPBR&#8217; Pd0 and PdII complexes (RDPBR&#8217;=(o&#8208;PR2C6H4)2BR&#8217;, diphosphinoborane) was analyzed using XRD, 11B&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and NBO/NLMO calculations. The borane acceptor discriminates between the oxidation state PdII and Pd0, stabilizing the latter. Reaction of lithium amides with [(RDPBR&#8217;)PdII(4&#8208;NO2C6H4)I] chemoselectively yields the C&#8722;N coupling product. DFT modelling indicates no significant impact of PdII&#8594;B coordination on the inner&#8208;sphere reductive elimination rate.

      <title>Incorporation of Boron into Uranium Metallacycles: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;Containing Uranacycles Derived from Bis(alkynyl)boranes</title>
      <dc:description>
The first bis(alkynyl)borane&#8208;supported actinide complexes are reported. Depending on R (i.e., the B&#8208;substituent), the bis(alkynyl)borane ligand can either coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;manner, affording a six&#8208;membered uranaboracycle, or undergo a UIV&#8208;assisted intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition to give a highly unusual fused bicyclic structure. More information can be found in the Communication by L. Maron, Q. Ye, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003611).

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of the Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)aluminate</title>
      <dc:description>
The tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)aluminate rises from the once hidden class of perfluoroalkyl aluminum compounds and flourishes in all its beauty. Perfluorinated aryl, aryloxy and alkoxy aluminum species are well&#8208;established but the corresponding perfluoroalkyl aluminum derivatives are virtually unknown. A convenient synthesis of several [Al(C2F5)4]&#8722; salts was developed by the reaction of Li[AlH4] with Si(C2F5)3CH3 and a subsequent cation exchange. However, the [NBu4]+ and [PPh4]+ salts decompose at room temperature. Utilizing a weakly coordinating phosphazenium cation enhances the thermal stability, yielding [{(Et2N)3P=N}3P=N(H)tBu][Al(C2F5)4] as a stable solid.

      <title>Prebiotic Nucleoside Synthesis: The Selectivity of Simplicity</title>
      <dc:description>
Unlocking life's mysteries: Achievements in the field of prebiotic RNA and DNA nucleoside and nucleotide synthesis are highlighted under consideration of plausible reaction conditions, starting from simple building blocks.







Abstract
Ever since the discovery of nucleic acids 150&#8197;years ago, major achievements have been made in understanding and decrypting the fascinating scientific questions of the genetic code. However, the most fundamental question about the origin and the evolution of the genetic code remains a mystery. How did nature manage to build up such intriguingly complex molecules able to encode structure and function from simple building blocks? What conditions were required? How could the precursors survive the unhostile environment of early Earth? Over the past decades, promising synthetic concepts were proposed providing clarity in the field of prebiotic nucleic acid research. In this Minireview, we show the current status and various approaches to answer these fascinating questions.

Abstract
A series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystals showing switchable fluorescence is reported. The fluorescence behavior results from the unique combination of hydrogen bonding, liquid crystallinity, and photobasicity. Thus, the molecular mobility in the mesophase is essential for the reversible photo&#8208;initiated proton transfer switching on the fluorescence of the assemblies. The application potential of the materials for photo&#8208;patterning was demonstrated.

      <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of S. mansoni O&#8208;Glycans and Their Evaluation as Ligands for C&#8208;Type Lectin Receptors MGL, DC&#8208;SIGN, and DC&#8208;SIGNR</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of parasite O&#8208;glycans structures have been prepared by chemoenzymatic synthesis and their affinity towards several C&#8208;type lectins screened using glycan arrays.







Abstract
Due to their interactions with C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs), glycans from the helminth Schistosoma mansoni represent promising leads for treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergies or cancer. We chemo&#8208;enzymatically synthesized nine O&#8208;glycans based on the two predominant O&#8208;glycan cores observed in the infectious stages of schistosomiasis, the mucin core 2 and the S. mansoni core. The O&#8208;glycans were fucosylated next to a selection of N&#8208;glycans directly on a microarray slide using a recombinant fucosyltransferase and GDP&#8208;fucose or GDP&#8208;6&#8208;azidofucose as donor. Binding assays with fluorescently labelled human CLRs DC&#8208;SIGN, DC&#8208;SIGNR and MGL revealed the novel O&#8208;glycan O8 as the best ligand for MGL from our panel. Significant binding to DC&#8208;SIGN was also found for azido&#8208;fucosylated glycans. Contrasting binding specificities were observed between the monovalent carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and the tetravalent extracellular domain (ECD) of DC&#8208;SIGNR.

Contrasting binding specificities were observed between the monovalent carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and the tetravalent extracellular domain (ECD) of DC&#8208;SIGNR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>Chemical synthesis is one of the practical approaches to access carbohydrate&#8208;based natural products and their derivatives with high qualities and in a large quantity. However, the stereoselectivity during glycosylation reaction is a main challenge, as the reaction can generate both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosides. The main focus of the present article is a concept of the recent mechanistic studies that applied statistical analysis and quantitation for defining the stereoselective changes during the process of reaction.

      <dc:description>Construction of local donor&#8208;acceptor architecture is one of the valid means for facilitating the intramolecular charge transfer in organic semiconductors. To further accelerate the interface charge transfer, a ternary acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2) molecular junction is established via gradient nitrogen doping into the polymer skeleton. Accordingly, the exciton splitting and interface charge transfer could be promptly liberated because of the strong attracting ability of the two different electron acceptors. Both DFT calculations and photoluminescence spectra elucidate the swift charge transfer at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface. Consequently, the optimum polymer, N3&#8208;CP, undergoes a remarkable photocatalytic property in terms of hydrogen production with AQY405 nm = 26.6% by the rational design of asymmetric molecular junctions on organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

At 2:3 MeOH:H  2  O, crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) occurs via formation of an emissive crystal phase, whereas, at 1:9 MeOH:H  2  O, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) occurs, induced by emissive supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). For  BNA&#8208;Ph  , the emission quantum yield was 25 times higher in aqueous methanol than that in pure methanol. Despite the high hydrophilicity of  BNA&#8208;X  (  C  log  P  = 6.1&#8722;8.0), the spherical NPs were monodisperse (polydispersity indices &lt; 0.2). Moreover, the emissive NPs exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with pyrene; however, for  BNA&#8208;X  bearing the TEMPO radical (  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  ), no FRET was observed because of quenching. In particular, the  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  NPs have a slow rotational correlation time (1.3 ns), suggesting applications as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with large relaxivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Completely Amine&#8208;free Open Atmospheric Synthesis of High Quality Cesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr3) Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Cesium Lead Halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) &#160;have been prominent materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other significant applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronics. The oleylamine which play an important role for surface passivation may also be responsible for poor colloidal stability as a result of facile proton exchange leading to the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide which pulls out halide ion from NCs surface. In this work, we demonstrated a facile and efficient completely amine&#8208; free synthesis of cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals using hydrobromic acid as halide source and n&#8208;trioctylphosphine (TOP) as ligand in open atmospheric conditions. The hydrobromic acid (HBr) served as labile source of bromide ion thus this three&#8208;precursor (separate precursors for Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br) approach gives more control over conventional single source precursor for Pb and Br (PbBr  2  ). The use of HBr paved the way to eliminate oleylamine, thus we can completely exclude the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide. We extensively studied the various Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br molar ratio and found an optimum condition which able to make very stable with high PLQY CsPbBr  3  NCs. These completely amine free CsPbBr  3  perovskite NCs synthesized using bromine&#8208;rich condition exhibit good stability and durability for more than three months in the form of colloidal solutions and films respectively. More importantly, this work presents an open atmospheric stable CsPbBr  3  NCs films exhibiting high photoluminescence (PL) which can be further used for&#160;device applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermolecular C&#8211;H Activation at the Allylic/Benzylic and Homoallylic/Homobenzylic Positions of Cyclic Hydrocarbons by a Stable Divalent Silicon Species</title>
      <dc:description>Direct activation of inert C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds by main&#8208;group&#8208;element species is yet a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene through the allylic/benzylic and homoallylic/homobenzylic C&#8211;H bond activation by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene  1  in neat condition to yield the corresponding aromatic compounds. As for the reaction of cyclohexene, allylsilane  3  and 7&#8208;silanorbornene  4  were also observed, which could be interpreted as a direct dehydrogenative silylation reaction of monoalkenes at the allylic positions. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene at the homoallylic position was accomplished by a combination of silylene  1  and radical intermediates such as hydrosilyl radical  INT1  or cyclohexenyl radical  H  which are generated in the initial step of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>With the growing demand for sustainability and reducing CO  2&#160;  footprint, lignocellulosic biomass has attracted much attention as a renewable, carbon&#8208;neutral and low&#8208;cost feedstock for the production of chemicals and fuels. To realize efficient utilization of biomass resource, it is essential to selectively alter the high degree of oxygen functionality of biomass&#8208;derivates. Herein, we introduced a novel procedure to transform renewable lignin&#8208;derived alcohols to various functionalized bibenzyl chemicals. This strategy relied on a concise deoxygenation coupling pathway with economical molybdenum catalyst. A well&#8208;designed H&#8208;donor experiment was performed to investigate the mechanism of this Mo&#8208;catalyzed process. It was proved that benzyl carbon&#8208;radical was the most possible intermediate to form the bibenzyl products. It was also discovered that the para methoxy and phenolic hydroxyl groups could stabilize the corresponding radical intermediates and then facilitate to selectively obtain bibenzyl products.

      <title>Asymmetric Ring Opening in Tetrazine&#8208;based Ligand Affording a Tetranuclear Opto&#8208;Magnetic Ytterbium Complex</title>
      <dc:description>We report the formation of a tetranuclear lanthanide cluster, [Yb  4  (bpzch)  2  (fod)  10  ] (  1  ), which occurs from a serendipitous ring opening of the functionalized tetrazine bridging ligand, bpztz (3,6&#8208;dipyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine) upon reacting with Yb(fod)  3  (fod  &#8208;  = 6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;heptafluoro&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;octandionate). Compound  1  was structurally elucidated  via  single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and subsequently magnetically and spectroscopically characterized to analyse its magnetisation dynamics and its luminescence behaviour. Computational studies validate the observed  M  J  energy levels attained by spectroscopy and provides a clearer picture of the slow relaxation of the magnetisation dynamics and relaxation pathways. These studies demonstrate that  1  acts as a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) under an applied magnetic field in which the relaxation occurs  via  a combination of Raman, direct, and quantum tunnelling processes, a behaviour further rationalized analysing the luminescent properties.

      <title>&#173;Rearrangements of Aromatic Nitrile Oxides and Nitrile Ylides. Potential Ring Expansion to Cycloheptatetraene Derivatives Mimicking Arylcarbenes</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrile imines, nitrile oxides and nitrile ylides are widely used in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. They also undergo thermal and photochemical rearrangements to carbodiimides, isocyanates, and ketenimines, respectively. Calculations at DFT and CASPT2 levels of theory reveal novel, potential rearrangements, in which the aromatic 1,3&#8208;dipoles mimic phenylcarbene and undergo ring expansion to cycloheptatetraene derivatives. These rearrangements can potentially take place in both the singlet ground states and the triplet excited states, and they are accelerated by m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino) substitution on the phenyl moieties. The new rearrangement becomes the energetically preferred path for m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzonitrile oxide in the triplet state. In the m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzo nitrile ylide, the cyclization to the 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;azirine is favoured over the ring expansion to a cycloheptatetraene by ca. 5 kcal/mol in the singlet state. In the bent triplet states, 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shifts interconverting nitrile ylides are potentially possible.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Despite their apparent similarity, framework materials based on tetraphenylmethane and tetraphenylsilane building blocks often have quite different structures and topologies. Herein, we describe a new silicon tetraamidinium compound and use it to prepare crystalline hydrogen bonded frameworks with carboxylate anions in water.

When terephthalate or bicarbonate anions were used, different products form. Insights into possible reasons for the different products are provided by a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database and quantum chemical calculations, both of which indicate that, contrary to expectations, tetraphenylsilane derivatives have less geometrical flexibility than tetraphenylmethane derivatives,  i.e.  they are less able to distort away from ideal tetrahedral bond angles.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Ambient Pressure Oxidation of Methane to Methanol Over Every Tri&#8208;Iron Node in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Material</title>
      <dc:description>In contrast with metal&#8208;modified zeolites, metal&#8208;organic framework materials (MOFs) provide a platform that may be significantly more amenable to creating catalysts in which every metal site is endowed with the same coordination environment, and hence, catalytic function. Using MIL&#8208;100(Fe) as a prototype, we present the first example of a synthetic heterogeneous catalyst comprised exclusively of active tri&#8208;iron moieties participating in the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of methane to methanol; in contrast with prior reports on iron&#8208;MOFs, we report the near&#8208;exclusive formation of methanol at low temperatures and sub&#8208;ambient methane pressures, and evidence its effectuation solely by Fe2+ sites. The study captures the utility of exploring classes of materials endowed with a high level of definition in structure and catalytic function for the purposes of overcoming persistent scientific and technological challenges in the field of synthetic heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Dinitrogen Fixation: Rationalizing Strategies Utilizing Molecular Complexes.</title>
      <dc:description>Dinitrogen (N  2  ) is the most abundant gas in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but its inertness hinders its use as a nitrogen source in the biosphere and in industry. Efficient catalysts are hence required to overcome the high kinetic barriers associated to N  2  transformation. In that respect, molecular complexes have demonstrated strong potential to mediate N  2  functionalization reactions under mild conditions while providing a straightforward understanding of the reaction mechanisms. This review emphasizes the strategies for N  2  reduction and functionalization using molecular transition metal and actinide complexes according to their proposed reaction mechanisms, distinguishing complexes inducing cleavage of the N&#8801;N bond before (dissociative mechanism) or concomitantly with functionalization (associative mechanism). We present here the main examples of stoichiometric and catalytic N  2  functionalization reactions following these strategies.</dc:description>

      <title>Alcohols as Fluoroalkyl Synthons: Ni&#8208;catalyzed Dehydrogenative Approach to Access Polyfluoroalkyl Bis&#8208;indoles</title>

The notable feature of the present transformation is the use of bench stable and easily affordable polyfluorinated alcohols without any pre&#8208;functionalization for the introduction of precious polyfluoroalkyl groups.
